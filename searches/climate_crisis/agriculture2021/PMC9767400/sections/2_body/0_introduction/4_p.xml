<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0015">In the present issue, we emphasize that women are central to food systems in developing countries, thus gender equality and women's empowerment should be a major consideration in improving food systems as a food security solution. According to FAO (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2018</xref>), &#8216;food systems encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products [&#8230;]&#8217;. In the recent past, food systems have gained increased attention among policymakers and researchers vis-&#224;-vis their implications on patterns of consumptions, and social and environmental welfare (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">B&#233;n&#233; et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Foran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Brinkley, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Ingram, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Ericksen, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Fanzo et al., 2021</xref>). It is evident that besides not delivering on adequate and healthy food, the current systems negatively influence environmental outcomes, such as depletion of production resources and unhealthy food habits contributing to lifestyle diseases (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Garnett and Godfray, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, food systems are now perceived as the primary basis for analyzing and understanding the state of global food and nutrition security (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Fanzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Carducci et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Barrett, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">HLPE, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">GP, 2016</xref>).</p>
