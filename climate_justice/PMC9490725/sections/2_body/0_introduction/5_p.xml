Sandel&#8217;s work on the crowding out of non-market norms reveals how the MBM discussion renders invisible and depoliticises alternative approaches such as direct regulation, regardless of whether the MBMs are even introduced. In this way, ongoing MBM discussions that never finish become a &#8220;discourse of climate delay&#8221; (Lamb et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>).</p>
