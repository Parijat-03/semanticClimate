The Recovery Plan includes consideration of what aspects of the new services and processes developed due to the pandemic might be retained when the programme returns to face-to-face service delivery. Advocacy opportunities have been identified as an important feature of our future clinical offerings. With generous support from local philanthropic organisations,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn72">72</xref> Monash is developing plans for clinic staff and students to engage in advocacy activities in a range of legal areas that have been heavily impacted by the pandemic. These include tenancy, guardianship and administration, family law, social security, as well as criminal law. The development of these opportunities has been informed by needs analyses and discussions with existing service providers regarding how to best implement new ideas to ensure effective service delivery for clients and enhanced learning opportunities for students.</p>
