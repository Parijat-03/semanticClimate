      <td>Disaster risk\nmanagement</td>
      <td>Disaster risk management encompasses many\napproaches to try to reduce the consequences of\nclimate- and weather-related disasters and events\non socio-economic systems. The Hyogo Framework for\nAction is a UN framework for nations to build resilience\nto disasters through effective integration of disaster risk\nconsiderations into sustainable development policies.\nFor example, in Vietnam a national strategy on disasters\nbased on Hyogo has introduced the concept of a &#8216;four-\non-the-spot&#8217; approach for disaster risk management of:\nproactive prevention, timely response, quick and effective\nrecovery, and sustainable development. Other widespread\napproaches to disaster risk management include using\nearly warning systems that can encompass 1) education\nsystems, 2) hazard and risk maps, 3) hydrological and\nmeteorological monitoring (such as flood forecasting\nor extreme weather warnings), and 4) communications\nsystems to pass on information to enable action. These\napproaches have long been considered to reduce the\nrisk of household asset damage during one-off climate\nevents and are increasingly being combined with climate\nadaptation policies.</td>
      <td>Community-based disaster risk management has been\npointed to as one of the most successful ways to ensure that\ninformation reaches the people who need to be participants\nin risk reduction. Effective disaster risk management\napproaches must be &#8216;end-to-end,&#8217; reaching communities at\nrisk and supporting and empowering vulnerable communities\nto take appropriate action. The most effective early warning\nsystems are not simply technical systems of information\ndissemination, but utilise and develop community capacities,\ncreate local ownership of the system, and are based on\na shared understanding of needs and purpose. Tapping\ninto existing traditional or local knowledge has also been\nrecommended for disaster risk management approaches\nto reducing vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Risk-sharing\ninstruments</td>
      <td>Risk-sharing instruments can encompass a variety of\napproaches. Intra-household risk pooling is a common\nstrategy in rural communities, such as through extended\nfamily financial transfers; one study found that 65% of\npoor households in Jamaica report receiving transfers, and\nsuch transfers can account for up to 75% of household\nincome or more after crisis events. Community rotating\nsavings and credit associations (ROSCAs) have long been\nused for general risk pooling and can be a source of\nfinancing to cope with climate variability as well. Credit\nservices have been shown to be important for adaptation\nactions and risk reduction. Insurance of various kinds is\nalso a form of risk pooling. Commercial crop insurance is\none of the most widely used risk-hedging financial vehicles,\nand can involve both traditional indemnity-based insurance\nthat reimburses clients for estimated financial losses from\nshortfalls, or index insurance that pays out the value of\nan index (such as weather events) rather than actual\nlosses; the former is more common for large farms in the\ndeveloped world and the latter for smaller non-commercial\nfarms in developing countries.</td>
      <td>Locally developed risk-pooling measures show general\npositive impacts on household livelihoods. However, more\ncommercial approaches have mixed effects. Commercial\ncrop insurance is highly subsidised in much of the developed\nworld. Index insurance programmes have often failed\nto attract sufficient buyers or have remained financially\nunfeasible for commercial insurance sellers. The overall\nimpact of index insurance on food production supply and\naccess has also not been assessed. Traditional crop insurance\nhas generally been seen as positive for food security as it\nleads to expansion of agricultural production areas and\nincreased food supply. However, insurance may also &#8216;mask&#8217;\ntruly risky agriculture and prevent farmers from seeking\nless risky production strategies. Insurance can also provide\nperverse incentives for farmers to bring additional lands into\ncrop production, leading to greater risk of degradation.</td>
