<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0155">Due to climatic impacts, conflict, and economic downturns, progress in addressing malnutrition has ground to a halt in recent years, and at the global level, the number of people suffering hunger has begun to increase again (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020a</xref>). Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, over 690 million people were undernourished (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020a</xref>) and many more suffered from food insecurity and micronutrient deficiencies. While chronic hunger remains a pervasive problem in developing countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of obesity and associated non-communicable diseases is on the rise globally (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). The structure of a food system is not static, but its components are influenced by biophysical and socioeconomic drivers. It is hence important to consider potential feed-back processes between various elements of the food system, particularly in light of global environmental change (e.g. <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Ericksen, 2008</xref>).</p>
