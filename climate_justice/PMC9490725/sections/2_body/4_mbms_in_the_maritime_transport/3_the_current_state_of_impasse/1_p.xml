A recent historical review of the process by Lagouvardou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>) reached an ultimately pessimistic conclusion that the rock bottom fuel price as a result of COVID-19 and the current market and policy turmoil will make it even more unlikely that any serious MBM will be implemented.</p>
