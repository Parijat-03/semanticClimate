<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0170">Over the past 70 years, the countries analyzed in this study have been experiencing increasingly warmer temperatures throughout the year and according to our initial analysis, the last decade has been the warmest (see <xref rid="sec0110" ref-type="sec">Additional File 1: Figs. S1&#8211;4</xref>). The results of our final model (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) show that average summer temperatures above 22&#160;&#176;C are positively associated with an increase in WNV incidence. This finding is consistent with the literature, according to which warmer temperatures influence the hatching rate and development time of mosquitoes, and shorten the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of WNV and related viruses, therefore representing a key driver of WNV transmission (especially in summer months) <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, this variable lost significance in our final model specification, suggesting it is not one of the main drivers associated with transmission in our study locations and that other factors may be at play. In particular, average summer temperatures lose their explanatory power once economic and land use factors are taken into account.</p>
