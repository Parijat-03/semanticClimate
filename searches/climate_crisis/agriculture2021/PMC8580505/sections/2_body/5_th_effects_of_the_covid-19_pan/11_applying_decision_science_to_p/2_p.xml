<boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><caption><title>Search strategy and selection criteria</title></caption><p id="para340">The investigation for this Personal View began in March 31, 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Due to the rapidly changing dynamic context and insufficient primary research on COVID-19 in the early stages, we used a broad diversity of search terms derived from group discussions and from historical pandemic literature, and added sources as they became available during 2020&#8211;21. Our search terms included &#8220;zoonotic origins covid-19&#8221;, &#8220;zoonotic disease outbreaks&#8221;, &#8220;human-animal interface&#8221;, &#8220;human wildlife interactions&#8221;, &#8220;zoonotic spillover&#8221;, &#8220;government response covid-19&#8221;, &#8220;economic response covid-19&#8221;, &#8220;driver zoonotic disease&#8221;, &#8220;land use change zoonotic disease&#8221;, &#8220;deforestation zoonotic disease&#8221;, &#8220;wildlife trade zoonotic diseases&#8221;, &#8220;climate change zoonotic disease&#8221;, &#8220;livestock zoonotic disease&#8221;, &#8220;agriculture zoonotic disease&#8221;, and &#8220;environmental impacts covid-19&#8221;. We searched across the &#8220;Impact Areas&#8221; terms used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>. We also searched the names of the diseases and pathogens listed in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 4&#8211;7</xref>; past zoonotic outbreaks) combined with the terms &#8220;origins&#8221;, &#8220;zoonotic source&#8221;, &#8220;animal&#8221;, &#8220;land-use change&#8221;, &#8220;deforestation&#8221;, &#8220;wildlife trade&#8221;, and &#8220;climate change&#8221;. Interchangeably with &#8220;zoonotic disease&#8221;, we used the terms &#8220;zoonoses&#8221;, &#8220;pathogens&#8221;, &#8220;cross-species disease&#8221;, &#8220;pathogen transmission&#8221;, and &#8220;zoonotic spillover&#8221;. We used these terms to search Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, and <italic>The Lancet</italic> archives. Additionally, we contacted experts around the world in search of further information.</p></boxed-text>
