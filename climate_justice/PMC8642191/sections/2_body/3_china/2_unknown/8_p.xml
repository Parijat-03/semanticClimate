For example, among the guidance on green insurance, &#8216;[a] catastrophe insurance system relating to climate change shall be established and improved&#8217; (par. 23). Pilot schemes for environmental catastrophe have been launched in several provinces (IIGF/UNEP Inquiry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>, 21). Moreover, the section on green credit requires institutions to take &#8216;environmental and social risks&#8217; into account when evaluating credit quality and allocating capital (par. 10), as well as &#8216;enterprises&#8217; violation of environmental laws and regulations&#8217; (PBoC et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2016</xref>, par. 11).</p>
