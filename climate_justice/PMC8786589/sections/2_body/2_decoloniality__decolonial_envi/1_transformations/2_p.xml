(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>, p.&#160;5) term &#8216;radical transformations&#8217;. The word &#8220;radical&#8221;, originating from the Latin<italic> radix</italic> meaning roots (Pugh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2009</xref>), in this context means changing the root causes, as opposed to symptoms of a problem. Radical transformations therefore focus on addressing the underlying structural root causes that (re)produce ecological destruction and societal injustices, many of which boil down to the politics, power, intersectionality, and the multiple justice dimensions. The power/politics and justice dimensions, as central elements of transformations, are mutually connected and in practice reproduce one another. For instance, power configurations such as capitalism, patriarchy, and state reproduce injustices against certain sections of society and identities defined through gender, race, ethnicity or caste (Le Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>; Kojola and Pellow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>; Sakshi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>; Sultana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2021</xref>). From the plethora of fields offering visions concerning transformations, I focus on decolonial environmental justice and degrowth.</p>
