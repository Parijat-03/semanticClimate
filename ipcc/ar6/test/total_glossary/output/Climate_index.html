<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A time series constructed from climate variables that provides an aggregate summary of the state of the <em>climate system</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the difference between sea level pressure in Iceland and the Azores provides a simple yet useful historical <em>North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)</em> index. Because of their optimal properties, climate indices are often defined using <em>principal components</em> — linear combinations of climate variables at different locations that have maximum variance subject to certain normalization constraints (e.g., the <em>Northern Annular Mode (NAM)</em> and <em>Southern Annular Mode (SAM)</em> indices which are principal components of Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere gridded pressure anomalies, respectively). Definitions of observational indices for <em>Modes of climate variability</em> can be found in Annex VI of the AR6 WGI report.</p>
