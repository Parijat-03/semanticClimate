Despite methodological disagreement on detection and attribution of migration due to climate change, there is medium confidence that higher warming and associated changes in frequency and intensity of slow-onset events (such as drought and sea level rise) and rapid-onset events (such as cyclones and flooding) will increase involuntary displacement in the future, especially under SSP3 and SSP4 pathways (Dasgupta et&#160;al., 2014a; Davis et&#160;al., 2018; Rigaud et&#160;al., 2018; Hauer et&#160;al., 2020).

In 2019, approximately 1900 disasters triggered 24.9&#160;million new displacements across 140&#160;countries; in particular, Bangladesh, China, India and the Philippines each recorded more than 4&#160;million disaster displacements (IDMC, 2019). Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia see significant disaster-associated displacements: for example, heavy rain-induced flooding in Khatlon (Tajikistan) triggered 5400 new displacements; landslides in the Jalal-Abad (Kyrgyzstan) saw 4700 new displacements; and floods in Altai, Tuva and Khakassia (Russia) displaced 1500 people. Iran reported the highest sub-regional figures with &gt;520,000 new disaster-related displacements in 2019 (IDMC, 2019). In Southeast and East Asia, cyclones, floods and typhoons triggered internal displacement of 9.6&#160;million people in 2019, almost 30% of total global displacements (IDMC, 2019). With most migrants in the region being temporary migrant workers, loss of jobs and wages among them have been particularly severe due to adverse economic climate triggered by COVID-19 (ESCWA, 2020). It has also resulted in large-scale returns of migrant workers, and remittances have declined drastically (Khanna, 2020; Li et&#160;al., 2021). Remittances to Eastern Europe and Central Asia are expected to decline 16.1% from 57&#160;billion USD in 2019 to 48&#160;billion USD in 2020. Remittances in East Asia and the Pacific are estimated to fall 10.5% over the same period, from 147&#160;billion to 131&#160;billion USD (United Nations, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on migrants (Rajan, 2020) in the region, and some countries have targeted migrants in economic stimulus packages or income-support programmes; however, access to such support has been heterogeneous.</span></div><div left="68.68" right="144.57" top="282.65"><span style="x0: 68.68; x1: 73.25; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="68.68" y0="282.65" x1="144.57">Projected migration. </span><span x0="145.21" y0="282.65" x1="558.24" style="x0: 145.21; x1: 150.14; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional variation is significant across Asia. By one estimate, in South Asia, internal climate migrants (i.e., those migrating due to climate change and associated impacts such as water scarcity, crop failure, SLR and storm surges) are projected to be 40&#160;million by 2050 (1.8% of regional population) under high warming (Rigaud et&#160;al., 2018). While methodological critiques remain on projected migration estimates, what is certain is that some countries will be more affected that others; it is estimated that in southern Bangladesh, SLR could displace 0.9&#8211;2.1&#160;million people by direct inundation by 2050 (Jevrejeva et&#160;al., 2016; Davis et&#160;al., 2018). In South Asia, migration hotspots include the Gangetic Plain and the Delhi&#8211;Lahore corridor, and coastal cities such as Chennai, Chittagong, Dhaka and Mumbai, which will be simultaneously exposed to climate-change impacts, major migration destinations and amplified rural&#8211;urban migration (Ober, 2019).

Even in high-risk places, people might choose to stay or be unable to move, resulting in &#8216;trapped&#8217; populations (Zickgraf, 2019; Ayeb-Karlsson et&#160;al., 2020).

Financial remittances help vulnerable households spread risk through better incomes, expanded networks and improved assets such as housing, education and communication technology (Jha et&#160;al., 2018; Szabo et&#160;al., 2018; Ober, 2019; Maharjan et&#160;al., 2020). Benefits from international remittances across the Asia Pacific region were approximately 276&#160;billion USD in 2017 (UN, 2018), and in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Nepal remittances were ~25% of the national GDP in 2015. However, migration requires a minimum level of resources, and liquidity constraints impede internal migration by the poorest households often rendering them immobile (Ayeb-Karlsson et&#160;al., 2020; Maharjan </span></div></body></html>
