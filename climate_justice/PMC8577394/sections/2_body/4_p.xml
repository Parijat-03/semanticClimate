First, for scholars of democracy, this study identifies a mechanism explaining the decoupling of public participation from democratic decision-making. Rather than focusing, as previous sociological research in the American context has, on how the state co-opts participation processes to advance private land development interests or restrict the redistribution of resources to poor urban neighborhoods (Levine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>; McQuarrie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>; Walker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2015</xref>), the case study draws on global scholarship on urban studies and development to argue that the state can exercise power through appeals to the rationality of technical expertise. Specifically, in New York, city officials enrolled the expertise of professional engineers and climate scientists as a way of defining the window of what is possible and to render the publicly-supported plan unfeasible.</p>
