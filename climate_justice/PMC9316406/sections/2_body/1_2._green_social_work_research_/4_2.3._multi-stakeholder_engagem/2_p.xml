Disaster-specific policies and programs serve as top-down strategies to guarantee multi-stakeholder engagement in community-centered disaster risk management and post-disaster activities [<xref rid="B41-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Macro-level social work training associated with policy and program development as well as advocacy for policy changes have generally focused on the social service sector during the non-disaster settings [<xref rid="B42-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Integrating GSW into the traditional social policy-related social work education and training realm will build the students&#8217; policy and program analysis and development capacity. This will ensure these macro-level interventions are implanted according to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction mandates and better serve the affected individuals, families, and communities [<xref rid="B43-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The evaluation of GSW-specific pedagogical outcomes associated with the macro-level social work practice, at this time, remains sparse.</p>
