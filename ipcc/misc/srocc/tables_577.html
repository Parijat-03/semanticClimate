      <td>SSP1 (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b) has low challenges to mitigation and adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:\n&#8211; continued, but moderate, climate change: global mean temperature increases by 3 to 3.5&#176;C in 2100 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017)\n&#8211; low levels of food insecurity: malnourishment is eliminated by 2050 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)\n&#8211; declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 38% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)\n&#8211; high water stress: global water withdrawals decline slightly from the baseline in 2071&#8211;2100, but about 2.6 billion people live in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013).\nAdditionally, this scenario is likely to have lower challenges related to desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss than SSP2 as it has lower population, lower\nland-use change and lower climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>SSP2 (Fricko et al. 2017) is a scenario with medium challenges to mitigation and medium challenges to adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:\n&#8211; continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 3.8&#176;C to 4.3&#176;C in 2100 (Fricko et al. 2017; Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017)\n&#8211; increased challenges related to desertification: the population living in drylands is expected to increase by 43% in 2050 (UNCCD 2017)\n&#8211; increased land degradation: soil organic carbon is expected to decline by 99 GtCO2e in 2050 (Ten Brink et al. 2018)\n&#8211; low levels of food insecurity: malnourishment is eliminated by 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)\n&#8211; declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 43% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)\n&#8211; high water stress: global water withdrawals nearly doubles from the baseline in 2071&#8211;2100, with about 4 billion people living in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013).</td>

      <td>SSP3 (Fujimori et al. 2017) is a scenario with high challenges to mitigation and high challenges to adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:\n&#8211; continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 4&#176;C to 4.8&#176;C in 2100 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017)\n&#8211; high levels of food insecurity: about 600 million malnourished in 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)\n&#8211; declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 46% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)\n&#8211; high water stress: global water withdrawals more than double from the baseline in 2071&#8211;2100, with about 5.5 billion people living in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013).\nAdditionally, this scenario is likely to have higher challenges to desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss than SSP2 as it has higher population, higher land-use\nchange and higher climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).</td>
