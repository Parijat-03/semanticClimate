For far too long, there has been denial of both climate change and racism by elected officials and legislators in Congress, talking heads on cable news, and even religious communities and clergy. One very influential radio and television preacher from Southern California, John McArthur Jr., who embraces a so-called young Earth creationism, has put forward the bizarre view that God intended the earth as a &#8220;disposable planet&#8221; (as cited in Daley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). This would be humorous if it were not for the fact that millions and millions of people listen closely to McArthur and other television preachers denying climate change, just as millions and millions of voters support political candidates who insist that reports of climate change and racism are &#8220;fake news&#8221; spread by the liberal media.</p>
