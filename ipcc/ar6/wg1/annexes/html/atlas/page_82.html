This is mainly due to the better representation of orography 3 at high resolution (e.g. Dyrrdal et al., 2018). Precipitation improvements in summer are attributed to better 4 representation of larger spatial convection structures. Limited added value was noted for heatwaves (Vautard 5 et al., 2013; Jury et al., 2018) and surface solar radiation (Vautard et al., submitted).  6 7 However, systematic errors persist in RCM simulations, such as cold and wet biases over much of the 8 continent and warm dry biases in the south in summer (Vautard et al., submitted). Seasonal and regionally 9 averaged temperature biases generally do not exceed 1.5&#176;C, while precipitation biases can be up to &#177;40% 10 (Kotlarski et al., 2014). The warm and dry summer bias over southern and south-eastern Europe is reduced 11 compared to the previous ENSEMBLES simulations (Katragkou et al., 2015; Giot et al., 2016; Prein and 12 Gobiet, 2017; Dell&#8217;Aquila et al., 2018), but over the Mediterranean, RCMs generally underestimate the 13 observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in summer, even with respect to the driving reanalysis. They 14 show rather limited ability to reproduce decadal variability in temperature and precipitation over the Euro-15 Mediterranean region (Dell&#8217;Aquila et al., 2018), which is strongly related to the considerable natural 16 variability at this time scale (Aalbers et al., 2018). In some cases these biases are mitigated by compensating 17 errors further complicating the picture within the Euro-CORDEX ensemble (Garc&#237;a-D&#237;ez et al., 2015; 18 Katragkou et al., 2015).  19 20 Coupled RCMs for the Baltic, North Sea and Mediterranean Sea have been further explored since AR5. 21 New, or updated, higher-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model systems have been found to 22 simulate realistically the observed climate over the Baltic area with some improvement with respect to stand-23 alone atmosphere model versions in features, like the correlation between precipitation and SST, between 24 surface heat-flux components and SST, and for weather events like convective snow bands over the Baltic 25 Sea (e.g. Gr&#246;ger et al., 2015; Pham et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2013; Van Pham et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). 26 Coupled atmosphere-land-river-ocean Regional Climate System Models (RCSMs) from Med-CORDEX 27 have similar skill as the ENSEMBLES ensemble and the Euro-CORDEX ensemble to represent decadal 28 variability of Mediterranean climate and its extremes (Cavicchia et al., 2018; Dell&#8217;Aquila et al., 2018; 29 Gaertner et al., 2018). A number of single model studies over the North Sea and Baltic Sea region (Tian et 30 al., 2013; Gr&#246;ger et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) have shown that ocean-atmosphere coupling improves the 31 representation of atmosphere and ocean compared to standalone model versions. Panthou et al. (2018) also 32 showed that over land differences between atmosphere-only and coupled RCMs are confined to coastal areas 33 that are directly influenced by SST anomalies. In contrast, Van Pham et al. (2014) showed significant 34 differences in seasonal mean temperature across a widespread continental domain. Sea wind (Akhtar et al., 35 2018), the turbulent air-sea fluxes (Sevault et al., 2014; Akhtar et al., 2018), and the seasonal cycle of the 36 medicane frequency (Gaertner et al., 2018) are shown to be improved in coupled RCSMs.  37 38 Convection-Permitting RCMs (CPRCM, running at a resolution of typically 1 to 3 km) are better able to 39 capture observed extreme precipitation behaviour than 12-km RCMs (Kendon et al., 2014; Prein et al., 2015; 40 Lind et al., 2016; Berthou et al., 2018; Fumi&#232;re et al., 2019; Ban et al., submitted). Precipitation on daily and 41 shorter time scales shows more coherent results than coarser resolution RCMs (Kendon et al., 2016). Ban et 42 al. (2014) found Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling between temperature and moderate (90th percentile value) 43 hourly precipitation events, while super-CC scaling was noted for the extreme (99th percentile and up) tails 44 of hourly precipitation.  45 46 The role of aerosol forcing is increasingly analysed as new and more realistic aerosol datasets become 47 available (Nabat et al., 2013; Pavlidis et al., submitted), and as RCMs begin to include interactive aerosols 48 (Nabat et al., 2012, 2015a; Drug&#233; et al., 2019; Nabat et al., submitted). Explicitly accounting for aerosol 49 effects in RCMs leads to improved representation of the surface shortwave radiation at various scales: long-50 term means (Guti&#233;rrez et al., 2018), day-to-day variability (Nabat et al., 2015a), and long-term trends (Nabat 51 et al., 2014).
