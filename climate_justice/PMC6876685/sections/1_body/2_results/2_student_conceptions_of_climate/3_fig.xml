At the beginning of the semester, 98% of participants chose one of the &#8220;yes&#8221; options (plotted in shades of green and to the right of the vertical center line), 2% chose &#8220;I don't know&#8221; (plotted in gray in the center of the plot), and 1% chose one of the &#8220;no&#8221; options (plotted in shades of brown on the left side of the plot). Most of these students arrived in the course already accepting that climate change is occurring and after instruction, more of them were extremely sure climate change is occurring. Only 44% were extremely sure that climate change is happening (darkest green fill) at the beginning of the semester, compared to 70% at the end of the semester</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-5" xlink:href="ECE3-9-12360-g002"/></fig>
