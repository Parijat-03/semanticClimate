While the policy instrument is zoning ordinances, the process of determining these regulations is covered in integrated land-use planning (Section&#160;7.6.2). Urban zoning can guide new growth in urban communities outside forecasted hazard areas, assist relocating existing dwellings to safer sites and manage post-event redevelopment in ways to reduce future vulnerability (Berke and Stevens 2016). Holistic integration of climate mitigation and adaptation are interdependent and can be implemented by restoring urban forests, and improving parks (Brown 2010; Berke and Stevens 2016). Zoning ordinances can contribute to SLM through protection of natural capital by preventing or limiting vegetation clearing, avoiding degradation of planning for rehabilitation of degraded land or contaminated sites, promoting conservation and enhancement of ecosystems and ecological corridors (Metternicht 2018; Jepson and Haines 2014). Zoning ordinances can also encourage higher density development, mixed use, local food production, encourage transportation alternatives (bike paths and transit-oriented development), preserve a&#160;sense of place, and increase housing diversity and affordability (Jepson and Haines 2014). Conservation planning varies by context and may include one or several adaptation approaches, including protecting current patterns of biodiversity, large intact natural landscapes, and geophysical settings. Conservation planning may also maintain and restore ecological connectivity, identify and manage areas that provide future climate space for species expected to be displaced by climate change, and identify and protect climate refugia (Stevanovic et al. 2016; Schmitz et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.58" x1="566.07">Anguelovski et al. (2016) studied land-use interventions in eight cities in the global north and south, and concluded that historic trends of socio-economic vulnerability can be reinforced. They also found that vulnerability could be avoided with a&#160;consideration of the distribution of adaptation bene&#64257;ts and prioritising bene&#64257;cial outcomes for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups when making future adaptation plans. Concentration of adaptation resources within wealthy business districts creating ecological enclaves exacerbated climate risks elsewhere and building of climate adaptive infrastructure such as sea walls or temporary &#64258;ood barriers occurred at the expense of underserved neighbourhoods (Anguelovski et&#160;al.&#160;2016a).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="553.19" top="579.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 579.42; y1: 589.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="579.42" x1="553.19">7.4.6.2 Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES)</span></div><div left="318.05" right="348.34" top="555.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="555.52" x1="348.34">There is </span><span style="x0: 348.76; x1: 350.87; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="348.76" y0="555.52" x1="410.18">limited evidence </span><span style="x0: 410.6; x1: 415.17; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="410.6" y0="555.52" x1="424.84">but </span><span style="x0: 425.26; x1: 429.83; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="425.26" y0="555.52" x1="484.75">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 485.17; x1: 487.98; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="485.17" y0="555.52" x1="566.11">that ecosystem-based adaptation (biodiversity, ecosystem services (ES), and Nature&#8217;s Contribution to People (see Chapter&#160;6)) and incentives for ES&#160;&#8211; including payment for ecosystem services (PES)&#160;&#8211; play a&#160;critical part of an overall strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change on land (UNEP 2009; Bonan 2008; Millar et al. 2007; Thompson et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="459.53"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.45; y0: 459.53; y1: 469.03; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="459.53" x1="566.11">Ecosystem-based adaptation can promote socio-ecological resilience by enabling people to adapt to the impacts of climate change on land and reduce their vulnerability (Ojea 2015). Ecosystem-based adaptation can promote nature conservation while alleviating poverty and even provide co-bene&#64257;ts by removing GHGs (Scarano 2017) and protecting livelihoods (Munang et al. 2013). For example, mangroves provide diverse ES such as carbon storage, &#64257;sheries, non-timber forest products, erosion protection, water puri&#64257;cation, shore-line stabilisation, and also regulate storm surge and &#64258;ooding damages, thus enhancing resilience and reducing climate risk from extreme events such as cyclones (Rahman et al. 2014; Donato et al. 2011; Das and Vincent 2009; Ghosh et al. 2015; Ewel et al. 1998).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="303.55"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 303.55; y1: 313.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="303.55" x1="566.13">There has been considerable increase in the last decade of PES, or programmes that exchange value for land management practices intended to ensure ES (Salzman et al. 2018; Yang and Lu 2018; Barbier 2011).

While some studies assess ecological effectiveness and social equity, fewer assess economic ef&#64257;ciency (Yang and Lu 2018). Part of the challenge surrounds the fact that the majority of ES are not marketed, so determining how changes in ecosystems structures, functions and processes in&#64258;uence the quantity and quality of ES &#64258;ows to people is challenging (Barbier 2011).
