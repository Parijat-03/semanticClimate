There is a general agreement, however, that decoloniality represents a critique of modernity (Quijano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2007</xref>), and of modern notions of development, which reproduce various forms of violence and oppression, including extractivism, racism, patriarchy, and cultural domination (Maldonado-Torres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2007</xref>; Lugones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2010</xref>). Building on Fanon&#8217;s decoloniality of mind (Fanon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">1967</xref>) various scholars have focused on decoloniality of imaginary and being (Latouche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2015</xref>; Maldonado-Torres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2007</xref>; Mignolo and Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2018</xref>). Decoloniality is also discussed in the context of human-nature duality (Rodr&#237;guez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>; Temper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>), power relations and forms of knowledge (Santos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2008</xref>).&#160;Unlike decoloniality of mind perspectives, indigenous perspectives frame decoloniality in more material and concrete terms and aims, which include ending structural systemic oppression and violence of colonialism, as well as repatriation or restitution of indigenous land (Tuck and Young <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2012</xref>).</p>
