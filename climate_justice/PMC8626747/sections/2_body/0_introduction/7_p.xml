The second section succinctly highlights their legacies in climate governance and the inextricable relationship between their normative behaviour and their development objectives. The third one provides an overview (i) of the signing of the strategic memorandum of understanding for economic and trade agreement between Mercosur and the EU in 2019 and (ii) of Sino-Brazilian relations facilitating investments and trade in multiple segments vis-&#224;-vis the most recent multifaceted backlash in Brazil&#8217;s socio-environmental and climate policies. Methodologically, the paper is based on an interdisciplinary review of studies in Political Science, Sociology, International Relations and Political Ecology. In addition, the article also relies on archival research on newspapers, such as <italic>Di&#225;logo Chino</italic>, <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Ag&#234;ncia P&#250;blica</italic>, technical notes produced by governmental agencies, reports published by civil society organizations and official databases.</p>
