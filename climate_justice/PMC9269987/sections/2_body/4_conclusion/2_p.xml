The current <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] (2022)</xref> started off strongly by consistently demanding more equitable societies. With great confidence, the authors thus declare that &#8220;solutions based on equity and social and climate justice reduce risks and enable climate resilient development&#8221; (p. 31). Climate justice is not only the ultimate goal of pro-environmental behavior, but it can also function as its elicitor by being a fundamental human motive that triggers strong moral emotions.</p>
