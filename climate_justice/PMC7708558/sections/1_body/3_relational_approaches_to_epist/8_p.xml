<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par32">Feminist scholars offer important socially situated epistemological discourses, including standpoint theory (Harding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1991</xref>), situated knowledge (Haraway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1988</xref>), and intersectional analysis (Crenshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1989</xref>). These discourses politicize and ethically orient sustainability research and have been most frequently employed within environmental justice scholarship (e.g. Kaijser and Kronsell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>; Malin and Ryder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2018</xref>). Feminist scholars have also developed diffractive methods to overcome the shortcomings of reflexive methods (e.g., Barad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>; Bozalek and Zembylas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>; Hill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>). Diffractive methods are used to read the insights of one discipline through another discipline to generate novel insights in the relation between differences (e.g., Larson and Philips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2013</xref>; Massei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2014</xref>; Doucet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>; Gullion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>).</p>
