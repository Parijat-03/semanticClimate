While some only understand &#8216;transformational&#8217; to indicate measures that are far-reaching (Kates et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>), others specify that such far-reaching measures should address questions of justice and equality, shifting focus to a more fundamental debate on rethinking society in the face of climate disruptions (Nightingale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). For instance, Pelling&#8217;s definition of transformational adaptation as &#8216;concerned with the wider and less easily visible root causes of vulnerability&#8217; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2011</xref>, 86) makes it clear that transformational adaptation is far-reaching in the sense of addressing fundamental political questions about the economic and political organization of society. Likewise, Schlosberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>) have argued that:<disp-quote><p id="Par12">Only an approach to adaptation that moves beyond a sole focus on the biophysical risks of climate change, to one that considers the larger and more complex processes that interact and produce vulnerability, can address social, environmental, and climate injustice.
