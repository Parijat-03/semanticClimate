This derails the entire movement and puts the blame on people who are poor and in the Global South. We have progressed past this point; we cannot blame the climate crisis on poor people who do not emit anything and who are experiencing the worst impacts. The top 10% of earners contribute the most greenhouse gas emissions, so we need to communicate about capitalism as the cause of climate change and normalise the conversation about climate and capitalism. We need to know how to access a broad range of information and deconstruct it using a systems analysis. As a youth movement, we need to be able to communicate our reality without pressure.</p>
