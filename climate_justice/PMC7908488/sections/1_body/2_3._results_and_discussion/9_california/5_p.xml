<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For average heat days, Palm Springs, Bakersfield, and Fresno had the highest spatial regression coefficients, substantially higher than other California cities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f007">Figure 7</xref>). These same cities also had substantially higher coefficients in the extreme heat scenario indicating that there were greater thermal inequities in these three metro areas. In both daytime scenarios, Sacramento had the lowest regression coefficients. Palm Springs and the Inland Empire had the highest regression coefficients for average and extreme heat days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f006">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that the highest income-based thermal inequities existed in these metro regions.</p>
