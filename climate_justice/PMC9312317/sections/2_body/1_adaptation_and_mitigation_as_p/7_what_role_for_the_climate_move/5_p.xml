In particular, given that recent campaigns like FFF have focused especially on demanding government action on climate change (de Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020b</xref>), the paper will look into whether protesters in these campaigns believe that such government action should prioritize mitigation, prioritize adaptation or address both equally. Doing so will give us crucial insights into whether these climate activists are still by and large focused on mitigation, as has often been assumed, or whether adaptation may be taking up a place of greater importance. If the latter is the case, a presumable precondition for FFF to play a role in democratizing and politicizing adaptation would appear to be fulfilled.</p>
