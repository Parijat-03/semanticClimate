Although there are areas of Delhi where he data is not available, the map below gives an indicative assessment of the adaptive capacity in the various administrative sub- districts (wards) of Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="239.11"><span x0="72.02" y0="239.11" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 239.11; y1: 251.11; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">According to these maps, Delhi is most deprived in financial and physical capital, with deprivation higher in areas with higher slum population concentration. These areas of high informal settlement are also the ones affected by high multiple deprivations. The areas affected the most by multiple deprivations of adaptive capacity include &#8211; Mangolpuri North, Mangolpuri South, Gokulpuri and Kondli (Baud, et al, 2009). Kondli and Magolpuri are administrative wards are low lying areas, in the vicinity of the Yamuna River, this is consistent with the first vulnerability map. Mangolpuri and Gokulpuri are resettlement colonies comprising mostly of former slum dwellers which can explain the multiple deprivations in these areas.  </span></div></body></html>
