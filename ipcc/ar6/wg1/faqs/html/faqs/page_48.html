However, the link between rainfall and flooding is complex, so while the most severe flooding events are expected to worsen, floods could become rarer in some regions. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="624.26"><span x0="69.02" y0="624.26" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 624.26; y1: 633.26; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Floods are a&#160;natural and important part of the water cycle but they can also threaten lives and safety, disrupt human activities, and damage infrastructure.

Flooding is also caused by coastal inundation by the sea, rapid seasonal melting of snow, and the accumulation of debris, such as vegetation or ice, that stops water from draining away. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="558.27"><span x0="69.02" y0="558.27" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 558.27; y1: 567.27; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate change is already altering the location, frequency and severity of flooding. Close to the coasts, rising sea levels increasingly cause more frequent and severe coastal flooding, and the severity of these floods is exacerbated when combined with heavy rainfall. The heavy and sustained rainfall events responsible for most inland flooding are becoming more intense in many areas as the climate warms because air near Earth&#8217;s surface can carry around 7% more water in its gas phase (vapour) for each 1&#176;C of warming. This extra moisture is drawn into weather systems, fueling heavier rainfall (FAQ 8.2, Figure&#160;1). </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="480.29"><span x0="69.02" y0="480.29" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 480.29; y1: 489.29; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">A warming climate also affects wind patterns, how storms form and evolve, and the pathway those storms usually travel. Warming also increases condensation rates, which in turn releases extra heat that can energize storm systems and further intensify rainfall. On the other hand, this energy release can also inhibit the uplift required for cloud development, while increases in particle pollution can delay rainfall but invigorate storms. These changes mean that the character of precipitation events (how often, how long lasting and how heavy they are) will continue to change as the climate warms. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="402.3"><span x0="69.02" y0="402.3" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 71.53; y0: 402.3; y1: 411.3; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In addition to climate change, the location, frequency and timing of the heaviest rainfall events and worst flooding depend on natural fluctuations in wind patterns that make some regions unusually wet or dry for months, years, or even decades. These natural variations make it difficult to determine whether heavy rainfall events are changing locally as a&#160;result of global warming. However, when natural weather patterns bring heavy and prolonged rainfall in a&#160;warmer climate, the intensity is increased by the larger amount of moisture in the air.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.83" top="336.31"><span x0="69.02" y0="336.31" x1="539.83" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 336.31; y1: 345.31; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">An increased intensity and frequency of record-breaking daily rainfall has been detected for much of the land surface where good observational records exist, and this can only be explained by human-caused increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Heavy rainfall is also projected to become more intense in the future for most places. So, where unusually wet weather events or seasons occur, the rainfall amounts are expected to be greater in the future, contributing to more severe flooding. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.77" top="270.33"><span x0="69.02" y0="270.33" x1="539.77" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 270.33; y1: 279.33; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">However, heavier rainfall does not always lead to greater flooding. This is because flooding also depends upon the type of river basin, the surface landscape, the extent and duration of the rainfall, and how wet the ground is before the rainfall event (FAQ 8.2, Figure&#160;1). Some regions will experience a&#160;drying in the soil as the climate warms, particularly in subtropical climates, which could make floods from a&#160;rainfall event less probable because the ground can potentially soak up more of the rain. On the other hand, less frequent but more intense downpours can lead to dry, hard ground that is less able to soak up heavy rainfall when it does occur, resulting in more runoff into lakes, rivers and hollows. Earlier spring snowmelt combined with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow can trigger flood events in cold regions. Reduced winter snow cover can, in contrast, decrease the chance of flooding arising from the combination of rainfall and rapid snowmelt. Rapid melting of glaciers and snow in a&#160;warming climate is already increasing river flow in some regions, but as the volumes of ice diminish, flows will peak and then decline in the future. Flooding is also affected by changes in the management of the land and river systems. For example, clearing forests for agriculture or building cities can make rainwater flow more rapidly into rivers or low-lying areas. On the other hand, increased extraction of water from rivers can reduce water levels and the likelihood of flooding.&#160;</span></div></body></html>
