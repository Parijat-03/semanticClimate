That is a big impact, probably the biggest you can make, other than giving up driving. Our collective eating habits impact the agricultural system, but even more profoundly, federal subsidies determine what gets produced and consumed in our agricultural system. Because corn, wheat, and soybean production are heavily subsidized, many farms that would have grown diverse crops for local consumption grow exclusively corn, wheat, and soybean. According to the US Department of Agriculture, corn acreage in the USA has increased from a government-mandated low of 60.2 million planted acres in 1983 to close to or exceeding 90 million since 2010, 40% of which is used for ethanol and 30% of which is fed to livestock (U.S Department of Agriculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>).</p>
