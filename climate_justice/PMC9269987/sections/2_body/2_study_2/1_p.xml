However, to provide a potentially more accurate measure for environmentally friendly behavior, we used a carbon footprint calculator in Study 2. The independent variables again were the justice sensitivity perspectives and moral disengagement in high carbon behavior. We included moral emotions as predictors and guilt as a mediator.</p>
