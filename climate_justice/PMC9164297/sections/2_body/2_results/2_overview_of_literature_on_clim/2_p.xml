<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">The review identified the connections between the SDGs, adaptation to climate change and co-production of knowledge, and/or participatory approaches in multiple strands of the literature post-2016. The most frequent occurrence of this combination was found in the literature about urban resilience and planning (n&#160;=&#160;8) and transformation (n&#160;=&#160;5), followed by adaptation governance (n&#160;=&#160;4) and agriculture (n&#160;=&#160;4). This is followed by water management (n&#160;=&#160;3), land use management (n&#160;=&#160;3), and development studies (n&#160;=&#160;3). The rest was distributed across related fields, with outliers in public health (n&#160;=&#160;1) and economics (n&#160;=&#160;1). The most frequent keywords &#8220;adaptation,&#8221; &#8220;sustainability&#8221; and &#8220;resilience&#8221; and co-occurrences of these between articles are illustrated in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The number and diversity of different keywords shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> illustrate how mainstream both the term co-production has become and the importance of contextualizing research on adaptation within a broader context of sustainability and SDG targets.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Relationships between keywords provided in the reviewed articles. Created with VOSviewer (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">van Eck and Waltman, 2010</xref>). The size of the circle is proportional to the occurrence of the keyword, while links represent keywords used together in at least two publications. The colors indicate the major themes in the corpus as a function of occurrences and relations of keywords in the publications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p>
