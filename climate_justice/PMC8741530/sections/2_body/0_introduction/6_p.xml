Namely, states define and justify their international identities through discursively constructing climate justice and related issues. During the early period of climate change governance, China had constructed its developing country identity and justified its rigid positions through persistently stressing historical responsibilities of developed/industrialized countries and framing developing countries as innocent and more vulnerable to climate change (Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>: 298). Climate change was always framed by China as a problem that developed countries should address first and China kept a low profile in climate change governance. With China&#8217;s transformation towards international climate leadership over the past decade, how has China constructed its international identity through discursively constructing issues of climate justice in shaping the climate regime?</p>
