There is growing evidence of the myriad health impacts of consumption of highly salinized water resulting from SLR <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.03.101" id="interref0006">[</ext-link>

Rise in hypertension, preeclampsia, and kidney disease were noted among communities consuming water high in salt content due to SLR <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Moreover, outbreaks of water-borne, vector-borne, and food-borne diseases were also noted to increase, which threatens the health status of people, particularly those living in the coastlines [<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While these impacts will be generally felt by all people in coastal communities, the health of PLHIVs can potentially be more harmed because of their weakened immune systems.</p>
