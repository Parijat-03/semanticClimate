To increase transparency, SBTi could document the decision-making process and selection criteria behind its recommendation of two specific target-setting methods (ACA and SDA), explicitly communicate the value judgments embedded in target-setting methods, and require companies with approved targets to publish information about the target-setting method and related company data. To increase the legitimacy of SBTs, SBTi could require companies with approved targets to periodically report third-party verified emission (and activity) data to a central, open access database, prevent companies from reporting emission reductions that are not real through market-based mechanisms, and reconsider the concept of SBTs for &#8220;renewable electricity procurement.&#8221; To increase uptake and the potential for positive impact, SBTi should target companies not already recognized for their climate disclosures (e.g., by virtue of a high CDP score) and increase efforts to recruit SMEs, companies in low- and middle-income countries, and companies in high-emitting sectors.</p>
