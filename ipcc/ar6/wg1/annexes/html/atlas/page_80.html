(2004) report positive temperature trends in spring over 1951-2000 (3&#176;Cin March and 24 1.5&#176;C in May). In Ukraine annual mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.57&#176;C (0.3 &#8211; 0.7&#176;C) per 25 decade in the period 1961 &#8211; 2010, with a particularly strong warming of 1.1 &#176;C per decade for JJA maximum 26 air temperature in the south-east steppe (Boychenko et al., 2016; Balabukh and Malitskaya, 2017). Loginov 27 et al. (2018) argued that the summer diurnal temperature range has decreased particularly in cities, but no 28 significant trend in winter mean air temperatures is shown between 1881 and 2016 in Belarus. In this area 29 the number of extreme weather events has decreased since 2001 attributed to a decrease in the meridional 30 south circulation. In Western Europe land-only observations analysed by Dong et al. (2017) indicate a rapid 31 increase in summer (JJA) mean surface air temperature since the mid-1990s. The change in temperature 32 during 1996&#8211;2011 relative to 1964&#8211;1993 ranges from 0.93 to 1.10 &#176;C. Ringard et al. (2019) report a 33 significant annual mean temperature increase since 1979 of 0.4 &#176;C per decade over Paris, with 0.52 and 0.46 34 &#176;C per decade in spring and summer, respectively. Also over Spain spring and summer temperatures are 35 reported to increase faster than in the other seasons (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2017). Gonzalez-Hidalgo et al. 36 (2016) found the temperature increase to be maximum between 1970 and 1990. 37 38 Trends in mean precipitation are generally small and non-significant. T&#237;mea and Anda (2017) report a 39 decrease of annual mean precipitation in Hungary of 11% between 1901 and 2004 (mostly in spring). Trend 40 analysis from 1966 to 2000 based on 3-hourly synoptic observations at 547 stations over Northern Eurasia by 41 Ye et al. (2017b, 2017a) indicated an increase of the number of convective precipitation days in winter of 4.3 42 day/decade, while an increase of 0.7 day/decade was seen in summer. While the precipitation fraction falling 43 as snow decreased, in Ukraine the intensity of heavy snowfall events has increased significantly and shifted 44 from the north-north-western parts in the past to south-south-eastern regions recently (Balabukh et al., 2018). 45 These trends were significantly correlated with surface warming and moistening. However, negative trends 46 in number of non-convective precipitation days were larger, leading to a small net decrease in the number of 47 wet days in spring, summer and fall. Murphy et al. (2019) re-evaluated the trends identified with the England 48 Wales Precipitation (EWP) series, and blame the widely reported trend to wetter winters (DJF) and drier 49 summers (JJA) over north-western Europe by gauge undercatch of snowfall for pre-1870 winters. For 50 summer, pre-1820 precipitation totals were too high, likely due to decreasing network density and less 51 certain data at key stations. 52 53 A substantial fraction of temperature extremes in Europe can be attributed to anthropogenic activity 54 (Coumou and Rahmstorf, 2012; Fischer and Knutti, 2015).
