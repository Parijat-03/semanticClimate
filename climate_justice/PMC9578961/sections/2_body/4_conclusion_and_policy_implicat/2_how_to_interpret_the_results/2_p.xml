Conversely, the sustainable development agenda should deserve deeper attention to environmental and governance dimensions when dealing with that in order to embrace and enhance these dimensions. When it comes to resource management and law enforcement or policymaking, the environment and governance are, respectively, neglected or only marginally approached. Similar dynamics apply to sub-dimensions that are largely characterised by financial components and, to a fewer extent, to economic and entrepreneurial contents. Domains outputs also reveal a large association to financial and social themes &#8211; financial access and services and the vulnerable &#8211; and some degree of variance.</p>
