At the core of resource egalitarianism are two claims: (1) that distributive justice should be evaluated in the &#8216;evaluative space&#8217; of resources, and (2) that the distribution of resources in society should be such that it is sensitive to people&#8217;s preferences, ambitions, and choices but not to those factors that are considered brute luck or beyond people&#8217;s control. That second claim is the characteristic that is needed to make a resourcist theory also a luck-egalitarian theory. Yet not all luck-egalitarian theories need to be resourcist; they could also look at matters of distributive justice in other dimensions, such as capabilities or utility. Resource-egalitarian theories of distributive justice contain many theoretical varieties, yet the subtle differences between these various forms are not relevant for the present analysis. What is relevant is that the factors (including actions) that have a causal effect on a person&#8217;s level of advantage must be categorized as either a preference (which some, following Ronald Dworkin, call an ambition) or a factor beyond one&#8217;s control (or &#8220;an endowment,&#8221; in Dworkin&#8217;s terminology).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> The equality of resources view holds that one is <italic>prima facie</italic> responsible for the costs of one&#8217;s ambitions or preferences but also holds that distributive justice requires compensation for what is called brute luck&#8212;the effects of those factors for which one can&#8217;t be held responsible, such as one&#8217;s endowments and the circumstances in which one finds oneself.</p>
