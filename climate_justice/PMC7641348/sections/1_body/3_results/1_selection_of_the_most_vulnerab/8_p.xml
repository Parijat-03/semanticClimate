<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The most vulnerable tracts in the state do not occur equally across regions. Some regions hold a disproportionate share of the state&#8217;s most vulnerable communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g002">Fig 2</xref>). 49.3% of tracts in the San Joaquin Valley, 31.1% of tracts in the Los Angeles and 21.5% of tracts in the Inland Desert regions are considered vulnerable by two or more indices. The Los Angeles region also accounts for the highest number of tracts vulnerable under all indices: 708. Conversely, only 7.7% and 0.6% of tracts in the North Coast and Sierra Nevada regions are considered vulnerable by two indices, respectively. No tracts in these regions are considered vulnerable by all three, and of the tracts that are designated as vulnerable, SVI is the prevailing index for the designation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240841.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Census tracts that are the least vulnerable (bottom quartile of vulnerability indices) are concentrated in the Los Angeles (33.8%), the Bay Area (32.4%), and the San Diego (13.8%) regions.</p>
