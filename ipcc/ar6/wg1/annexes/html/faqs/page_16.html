This conclusion is based on a synthesis of information from multiple lines of evidence, including direct observations of recent changes in Earth&#8217;s climate; analyses of tree rings, ice cores, and other long-term records documenting how the climate has changed in the past; and computer simulations based on the fundamental physics that governs the climate system.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.51" top="611.22"><span x0="74.69" y0="611.22" x1="545.51" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 80.19; y0: 611.22; y1: 620.22; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate is influenced by a range of factors. There are two main natural drivers of variations in climate on time scales of decades to centuries. The first is variations in the sun&#8217;s activity, which alter the amount of incoming energy from the sun. The second is large volcanic eruptions, which increase the number of small particles (aerosols) in the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight and cool the surface&#8211;an effect that can last for several years (see also FAQ 3.2). The main human drivers of climate change are increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and of aerosols from burning fossil fuels, land use and other sources. The greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation near the surface, warming the climate. Aerosols, like those produced naturally by volcanoes, on average cool the climate by increasing the reflection of sunlight. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that human drivers are the main cause of recent climate change.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.45" top="497.25"><span x0="74.69" y0="497.25" x1="545.45" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 497.25; y1: 506.25; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years. Several lines of evidence clearly show that these increases are the results of human activities. The basic physics underlying the warming effect of greenhouse gases on the climate has been understood for more than a century, and our current understanding has been used to develop the latest generation climate models (see FAQ 3.3). Like weather forecasting models, climate models represent the state of the atmosphere on a grid and simulate its evolution over time based on physical principles. They include a representation of the ocean, sea ice and the main processes important in driving climate and climate change.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.43" top="395.27"><span x0="74.69" y0="395.27" x1="545.43" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 80.19; y0: 395.27; y1: 404.27; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Results consistently show that such climate models can only reproduce the observed warming (black line in FAQ 3.1, Figure&#160;1) when including the effects of human activities (grey band in FAQ 3.1, Figure&#160;1), in particular the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. These climate models show a dominant warming effect of greenhouse gas increases (red band, which shows the warming effects of greenhouse gases by themselves), which has been partly offset by the cooling effect of increases in atmospheric aerosols (blue band). By contrast, simulations that include only natural processes, including internal variability related to El&#160;Ni&#241;o and other similar variations, as well as variations in the activity of the sun and emissions from large volcanoes (green band in FAQ&#160;3.1, Figure&#160;1), are not able to reproduce the observed warming. The fact that simulations including only natural processes show much smaller temperature increases indicates that natural processes alone cannot explain the strong rate of warming observed. The observed rate can only be reproduced when human influence is added to the simulations.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.53" top="257.3"><span x0="74.69" y0="257.3" x1="545.53" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 83.19; y0: 257.3; y1: 266.3; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Moreover, the dominant effect of human activities is apparent not only in the warming of global surface temperature, but also in the pattern of warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere, warming of the ocean, melting of sea ice, and many other observed changes. An additional line of evidence for the role of humans in driving climate change comes from comparing the rate of warming observed over recent decades with that which occurred prior to human influence on climate. Evidence from tree rings and other paleoclimate records shows that the rate of increase of global surface temperature observed over the past fifty years exceeded that which occurred in any previous 50-year period over the past 2000 years (see FAQ 2.1).</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.52" top="167.32"><span x0="74.69" y0="167.32" x1="545.52" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 167.32; y1: 176.32; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Taken together, this evidence shows that humans are the dominant cause of observed global warming over recent decades.</span></div></body></html>
