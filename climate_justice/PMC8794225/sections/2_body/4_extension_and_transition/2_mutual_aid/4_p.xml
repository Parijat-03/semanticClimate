The routinization of annual wildfires, heat domes, deep freezes, hurricanes, 500-year floods, and drought make clear how unprepared we are for climate catastrophe. Conversations around infrastructure have overlooked the social infrastructure of caretaking that is required to address needs, for shelter, food, first aid, and more, that persist after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leaves. Liberation Extension could help train emergency responders and local and regional response units, connect communities to resources through mutual aid, educate communities about local risks from climate change, and help them develop harm reduction strategies while building political coalitions for extended relief and decarbonization.</p>
