Thus, even under revised programs, such as those recommended by the authors below that would provide the tenant some post-disaster relief based on the value of the home, tenants in predominantly non-white areas would receive less than similarly situated tenants in predominately white neighborhoods. Minority neighborhoods also have a history of tax assessors over assessing the minority-owned homes while under assessing white-owned homes, leading to a larger relative (percentage) tax burden for minority-owners (Rothstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>).</p>
