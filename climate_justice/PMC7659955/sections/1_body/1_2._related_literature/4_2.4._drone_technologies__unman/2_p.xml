<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Primicerio et al. [<xref rid="B37-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] adopted VIPtero, a UAV for managing a vineyard in an experimental set-up in Italy. The system, which is made up of an aerial platform with six rotors and a camera, can fly in a self-governed manner to a particular point in the air, in order to take measurement of the vegetation canopy reflectance. Prior to flight take-off, accuracy of the camera is evaluated in relation to ground-based measurements with high resolution, which were gathered using field spectrometer. Subsequently, VIPtero gets air-bound in the vineyard, and gathers as many as 63 multi-spectral images in a 600 seconds time period. The recorded images are analyzed and classified, prior to the production of vigor maps on normalized difference vegetation index. Results showed the heterogeneity conditions of the crops, implying that they were in line with those gathered using the ground-based spectrometer [<xref rid="B37-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This smart system appears to be promising as an effective and detailed data gathering system in agriculture, and can be adopted over larger areas in smart villages.</p>
