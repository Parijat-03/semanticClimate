For example, following the 2008 recession, charitable foundation endowments in the USA declined by 25%,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> and government investment for Spain's Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Environment declined by 31%, affecting research and conservation programmes.<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> Pergams and colleagues<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> determined that gross domestic product and personal income can help predict conservation spending, including conservation-focused land purchases, national parks visitation, university programmes in the conservation field and membership in professional conservation organisations, suggesting that diminished gross domestic product and income can lead to reductions in these indicators.<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref>
