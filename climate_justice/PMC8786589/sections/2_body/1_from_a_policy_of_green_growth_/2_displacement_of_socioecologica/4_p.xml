Considering that some of the key actors in the bioeconomy and in GDP-rich EU member states are agribusinesses and the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. Korhonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>), the risks and concerns only increase (FFRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>). Considering the path dependency, power relations and institutions embedded in the global environmental governance, it is highly unlikely that the local dispossession and violence associated with many of such policies (Huff and Orengo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Milne and Mahanty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2019</xref>; Ramcilovic-Suominen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2021</xref>) are to subside in the case of bioeconomy. On the contrary, given the importance of market-based and technoscientific solutions in the EU bioeconomy, the same actor coalitions and the path dependencies (Vogelpohl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2021</xref>), there are numerous reasons to be concerned about the impacts of the EU bioeconomy policy in the Global South and global peripheries elsewhere (Sovacool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2021</xref>; Sovacool et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2021</xref>; Zografos and Robins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2020</xref>).</p>
