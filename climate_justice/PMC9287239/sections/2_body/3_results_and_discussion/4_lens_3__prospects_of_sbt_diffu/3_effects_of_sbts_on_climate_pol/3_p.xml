For example, Dagnet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] argue that SBTs, and the corporate emission disclosure involved, can inform policymaking, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, questions of how and when SBTs may serve as drivers or barriers of more progressive and ambitious climate policy largely remain unanswered. For example, SBTi routinely encourages companies with SBTs to sign letters in support of more ambitious climate policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref>; all the while some companies with SBTs appear to be members of industry associations lobbying against such policies. From a broader perspective, Walenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] argues for the need for critical engagement with SBTs within the existing scholarship on the intersection of corporations and climate change and outlines a research agenda with the aim of understanding, among other things, the climate justice significance of SBTs.</p>
