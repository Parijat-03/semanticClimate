As a blueprint for conserving the environment for the young and succeeding generations, the Preamble specifically calls for intergenerational equity (IE) and moderation in the use of exhaustible resources. As a social concept, IE may be construed as a moral proclivity for fair consumption of resources to ensure the same resources will serve the needs of one&#8217;s progenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As an unwritten law, this moral code may somewhat be tied to the African identity and philosophy of &#8216;ubuntu&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Often captioned as &#8216;I am because we are&#8217;, one may loosely translate this idiom as &#8216;humanity towards others&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As a result, the notion of environmental conservation as entrenched under section&#160;24(b) of the Constitution may well be said to have sprung from IE which is imbued in traditional customs. Drawing from its historical background, the constitutional provision underscores the need for fair consumption of natural resources without jeopardizing their future benefits.</p>
