<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par5">Against this background, we analyze how relational discourses<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> have been understood and conceptualized across a broad range of disciplines and contexts relevant to sustainability to identify and harness their connections and contributions for future sustainability-related work. For an emerging paradigm to become mainstream, there must be a coordinated shift in our way of being, thinking, and acting. To better understand how assumptions may be linked, we have, therefore, categorized literature into ways of being (ontologies), thinking (epistemologies) and acting (ethics). These three categories were selected as fundamental aspects of relationality based on the work of Varela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">1999</xref>), Barad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>), Kassel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2016</xref>), Escobar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>), and Puis de la Bellacasa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2017</xref>) who describe relational ways of being, thinking, and acting as a single tri-partite constellation&#8212;an ethico-onto-epistemology&#8212;that does not presuppose subject-object and nature-culture binaries.</p>
