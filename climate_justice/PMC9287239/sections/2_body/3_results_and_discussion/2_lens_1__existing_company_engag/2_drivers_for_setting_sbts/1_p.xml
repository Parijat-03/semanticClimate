Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] considered all publicly traded companies, regardless of whether they had set emission reduction targets, while Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] considered companies with declared emission reduction targets. Both distinguished between SBTs and other targets. Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] referred to the latter as &#8220;non-science targets&#8221; set via internal standards (e.g., benchmarking against peers&#8217; targets or past performance). We instead use &#8220;internal targets&#8221; as there are instances of companies setting targets ambitious enough to be considered science-based by SBTi, without seeking SBTi approval. Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] evaluated the association of company, industry, and country-level characteristics with a company&#8217;s decision to set targets (i.e., internal targets, SBT commitments, and approved SBTs). They used Trucost, CDP (relying on corporate self-disclosure), and SBTi data from 2005 to 2019 for 17,385 publicly traded companies from 66 countries representing roughly 99% of global market capitalization. Of these, 1,957 (11.3%) declared an internal target and 455 (2.6%) set or committed to setting an SBT. They found that companies are more likely to set targets if they have higher fixed assets, are part of MSCI world index<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref>, have higher stock price volatility, already disclose emissions, are under greater analyst coverage, have more women board members, have more antitakeover protections, and receive more financial media coverage about controversial decisions. Companies are less likely to set targets if they have a larger board, a higher average board member tenure, more board directors with a finance background, and if they are from the most or least carbon-intensive industries. These results are similar (albeit less significant) for committed and approved SBTs as for internal targets<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref>. Companies are more likely to set an SBT if they previously set an internal target. The relationship between target-setting and the level of emissions varies by emission scope. For example, companies with higher scope 2 emissions are more likely to set internal targets but less likely to set SBTs. Overall, however, companies with higher absolute emissions are less likely to set targets. Companies were slightly more likely to set targets when their home countries set Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in the lead up to the Paris Agreement than they were when their home countries established Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) after the Paris Agreement. Based on this, Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,] suggested that companies may feel pressure to signal intent alongside their governments, but less pressure to make commitments once governments takes more concrete action. Surely, there is some relationship between corporate target setting and national policy, but this finding offers only weak evidence, given that almost all countries have NDCs and most of these already had INDCs.</p>
