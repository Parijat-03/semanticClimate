<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par30">The long-term temporal pattern of the levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) shows a considerably complex variation pattern from the late 19th century to the early 21st century. The lake level had a mean annual lake level of 473.8 m ASVD (Stdev = 1.65 m ASVD) with a coefficient of variability (CV) of 0.349%. The CV suggests relatively low variation around the mean lake level during the period. Based on the available empirical record from 1899 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the lake levels had a decreasing trend up to a minima of about 470.4 m ASVD in 1915. Records (e.g., Sene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>; Nicholson et al. 2018) also show persistent extreme drought conditions over many parts of Malawi due to low rainfall during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The extremely low lake levels exposed a sandbar at the lake outlet which consequently blocked flows into the Shire River between 1915 and 1935. However, Sene et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>) suggest that the Shire River actually stopped flowing in 1908 due to the extremely low lake levels. The lake levels started to rise almost linearly from 1915, reaching a local peak of 475.1 m ASVD in 1940. Neuland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1984</xref>) attributed this steady rise in lake levels to a blockage of the Shire River by the tributary Nkasi River. Flows to the Shire River were restored around 1935 when the lake levels overtopped the sandbar with a lake level of 473 m ASVD. The hydrograph of the nearby Lake Chilwa, located to the south east of Lake Malawi, also shows a similar temporal lake level variation pattern up to around 1980 (Nicholson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2001</xref>). After the May 1980 peak, the lake levels have mostly been on a downward trajectory. Local peaks can be seen around 2003 and 2009.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Hydrograph of mean annual levels of Lake Malawi from 1899 to 2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
