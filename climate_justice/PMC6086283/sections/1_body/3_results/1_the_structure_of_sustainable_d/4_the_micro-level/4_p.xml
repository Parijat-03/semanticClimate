In this regard, the PA defines &#8220;climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information&#8221; (PA, 12) as a politico-scientific norm on the micro-level. The SDGs are complementary here in pointing to the lifestyle aspect of the information norm when pledging that &#8220;[b]y 2030, [we] ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature&#8221; (SDGs, preamble). Lifestyles relate to cultural norms adopted by individuals, but they are not prominent in the SDGs.</p>
