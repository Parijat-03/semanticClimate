This information and knowledge could be ranging from climate science and impacts to; mitigation and low carbon development paths. A strategic knowledge system should be able to integrate and organize information and assessments from multiple sources at various scales and present it to stakeholders in a useful form. The focus should also be to adapt existing knowledge and systematically organize knowledge products. A careful synthesis of existing knowledge is necessary through the use of information and communication technology (ICT) amongst other relevant technologies. Further, an arrangement for real time data sharing among various data sources is necessary for building strategic actions based on knowledge-led paths. In the following section we present some important initiatives in the state of Delhi that are intended to collate, present and manage knowledge relevant for action on climate change. </span></div></body></html>
