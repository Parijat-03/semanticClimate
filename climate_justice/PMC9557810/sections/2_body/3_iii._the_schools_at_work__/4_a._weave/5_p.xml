to open up the university and transform the education of urban practitioners
through a collective transdisciplinary pedagogical experience. Originally
implemented at the National University of C&#243;rdoba (Argentina), over time the
pedagogic principles and practices of <italic toggle="yes">Taller Total</italic> were adopted
in other locations and disciplines. While this wave of radical pedagogies was
brought to a halt in 1975 by the repressive dictatorship of 1976&#8211;1983, its
legacy continues to be re-lived by contemporary experiences such as the
<italic toggle="yes">Barrio Intercultural</italic> and the diploma course. In these
experiences, the key tenets of <italic toggle="yes">Taller Total</italic> are reactivated
under contemporary circumstances, prompting a dissolution of disciplinary
boundaries converging in the &#8220;habitat&#8221; problematic by building a critical
history of the habitat and its social production, while weaving in new
capacities and possibilities for social transformation.</p>
