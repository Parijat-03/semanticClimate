(<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 5). In their analysis of other rights-based claims in climate litigation cases, Peel and Osofsky (2017) conclude that receptivity of courts to rights-based framing is on the rise because it provides a &#8220;tangible legal framework for analyzing state actions that lead to climate change&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This is encouraging from a public health standpoint, as all UN human rights treaty bodies now recognize individual rights to life, health, food, and water [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268633.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], providing a stronger legal avenue for plaintiffs to link claims of health threats to rights-based legal frameworks.</p>
