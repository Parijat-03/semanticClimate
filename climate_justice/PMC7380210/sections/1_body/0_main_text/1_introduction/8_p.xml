The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been uniform. Neither will be the effects of climate shocks. The most vulnerable and marginalized communities will suffer the most as impacts follow established lines of social inequality and racism. Concerns for climate justice need to guide us to overcome the serious deficits in our attitudes. Meaningful political action needs to be based on scientific facts and a feeling of solidarity to achieve more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable economies and societies.</p>
