Critics of the marketisation of emissions include Goodin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1994</xref>), Frey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2000</xref>), Dobson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>), O&#8217;Neill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2007</xref>), Randalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2010</xref>), Spash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2010</xref>), Aldred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>) and Sandel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012a</xref>), who all point out in various ways the problems that arise by putting a price on previously priceless things such as the environment. These problems include the importance of who does the reducing (e.g. the &#8220;buying indulgences&#8221; argument of Goodin), crowding out of the genuine value of the environment and reducing the responsibility of stewardship. Those who defend market-based mechanisms against these criticisms include Caney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>), Page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2011</xref>) and Dirix et al.
