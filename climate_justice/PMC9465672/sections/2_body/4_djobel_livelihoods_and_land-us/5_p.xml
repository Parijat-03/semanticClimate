Almost seven decades of observation (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) reveal a substantial loss of swamp rice fields (an annual net loss of -2.4%) and a regeneration of mangrove areas (an annual net gain of 0.8%), together with an increase in flooded land and mud (an annual net gain of 2.9%). Grasslands occupied only a small area during the whole period under study.</p>
