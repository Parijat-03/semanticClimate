Despite the scientific consensus on climate change (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2014</xref>), public attitudes are highly polarized (Guber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>; McCright and Dunlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2011</xref>). Variation in climate attitudes tends to fall in four primary areas: public understanding and awareness,&#160;the existence of climate change,&#160;issue salience, and public policy (Egan and Mullin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>). On understanding and awareness, a 2020 Yale survey showed that only a slight majority (55%) of the public believes that &#8220;most scientists think global warming is happening,&#8221; which does not reflect the current scientific consensus (Leiserowitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2020</xref>; Egan and Mullin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>). Furthermore, while a large majority of the public (72%) say climate change is happening, only a smaller majority (57%) indicate that it is human-caused (Marlon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2020</xref>).</p>
