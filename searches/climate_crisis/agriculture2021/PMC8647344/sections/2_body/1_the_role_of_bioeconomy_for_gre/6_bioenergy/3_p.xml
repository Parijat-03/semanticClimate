<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0350">The circular bioeconomy offers excellent possibilities to integrate biochemical and thermo-chemical processes in local biorefineries that can valorize residues and co-products of upstream routes, produce multiple biobased products, energy, and fuels; thus improving circularity<sup>6</sup>. This strategy would mitigate climate change and contribute to local resilience and rural socio-economic development (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou and Chiaramonti, 2020</xref>) by delivering higher biomass shares within target sectors, creating new permanent jobs, and mitigating raw material competition (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Burger et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, biofuel's role in the markets can be even more critical if a higher penetration of electricity in transportation is achieved in the future. The EU Renewable Energy Directive II (REDII) addresses several of these issues but do not fully encompass the relevance of strategic storage and EU-based supply chains as probably needed to push the most-needed EU economic recovery (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Chiaramonti and Goumas, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Chiaramonti and Maniatis, 2020</xref>).</p>
