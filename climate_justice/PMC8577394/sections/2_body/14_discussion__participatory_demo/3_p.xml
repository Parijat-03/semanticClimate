The movement resisting the ESCR project can be compared to the 2018&#8211;2019 opposition to Amazon&#8217;s proposal to build their second headquarters, &#8220;HQ2,&#8221; in Long Island City, Queens. In 2018, New York&#8217;s&#160;city government proposed a generous set of public subsidies to attract Amazon to the neighborhood in exchange for much-needed employment for nearby residents, a large portion of whom live in public housing by the coast. Some local representatives of public housing residents (overwhelmingly people of color) and local unions supported HQ2, but progressive residents&#160;across the city vocally resisted the proposal. The opponents of HQ2 plan were backed by a group of local politicians including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Due to overwhelming pressure, Amazon eventually withdrew their proposal (Goodman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). There are substantive differences between the ESCR project and Amazon&#8217;s HQ2 proposal. Amazon&#8217;s facility, in theory, promised to provide employment for nearby residents, while the ESCR project aims to protect people from flooding and will not directly financially benefit residents. Additionally, progressive New Yorkers did not reject the Amazon HQ2 on because they use the Queens waterfront for recreation or for its environmental amenities. They resisted the proposal because they reject Amazon&#8217;s practices as a business in general, citing cruel working conditions for employees and the potential erosion of the city&#8217;s identity (Goodman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>).</p>
