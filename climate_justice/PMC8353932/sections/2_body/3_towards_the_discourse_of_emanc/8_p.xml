It impels us to pay closer attention to societal losses that might inevitably arise from climate change (Barnett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>; Asayama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>). Building our sense of togetherness and ability to care better for the <italic>unknown other</italic> through empathy (Antadze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>) will help us collectively come to terms with climate loss. Such a cultural narrative can animate political action while embracing social losses.</p>
