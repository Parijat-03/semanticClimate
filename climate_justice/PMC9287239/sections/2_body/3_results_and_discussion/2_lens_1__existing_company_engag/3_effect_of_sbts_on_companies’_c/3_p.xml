Six of these issuers had approved SBTs when the study was carried out. A positive finding would have supported the assertion made in SBTi&#8217;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] 2020 progress report that &#8220;on financial markets we are seeing a movement towards science-based targets being embedded into sustainability-linked bonds.&#8221; Instead, Tuhkanen and Vulturius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] found limited explicit reporting linking green bond funding to meeting the SBTs of the issuers. Overall, this indicates little pressure on green bond issuers to use proceeds to achieve SBTs.</p>
