The likelihood is that the increase is absorbed regardless, either by the provider (by decreasing their profit or avoiding the cost by improving their efficiency) or by the consumer (by simply accepting to pay more for transport). Recent skyrocketing freight rates suggest that the cost will be absorbed and not significantly change behaviour by either actor. Sandel&#8217;s argument shows how treating environmental protection as a market relationship whereby the polluter pays has crowded out non-market norms that it is not acceptable to pollute. The last decade has furnished endless technical discussions about where to set the price rather than building consensus that polluting activities are unacceptable and should be phased out.</p>
