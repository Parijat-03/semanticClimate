<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This study has contributed to the documentation already present outlining inequitable thermal exposure between different demographic groups [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As evidenced by the SUHI intensity measurements within prevalent census tracts of each demographic group, the temperature disparity is shown to be increasing through time. This increase is statistically significant for both Black and White prevalent census tracts for the observed temperature trend. Overall, within the Bayesian spatial temporal models, temperature is shown to be increasing by 0.01 K per year on average. Granted 0.01 K per year may not seem like an alarming temperature rise but this increase is on average and there are many tracts with greater temperature increases. Further studies should look to examine or grade the tracts that have the highest level of increase or decrease to determine differences between them and help guide intervention strategies aimed at lowering SUHI intensity. Such studies would advance our understanding of social and environmental contributors to thermal exposure at a local scale. Additionally, it would help determine what constitutes a &#8220;good&#8221; tract vs. a &#8220;bad&#8221; tract, at least in a thermal sense.</p>
