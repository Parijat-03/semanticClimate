We systematically collected information from institutional websites and annual reports. Through online interviews, 11&#160;key informants validated the information from 9 of the institutions and shared their opinions regarding what factors are helping their institutions decarbonise and what factors are hindering progress.</p></sec><sec id="tmi13714-sec-0003"><title>Results</title><p>4/10 institutions sampled have a sustainability strategy and implementation plan, only 3/10&#160;have specific decarbonisation goals, and 3/10 are reporting on progress. 5/10 institutions reported that they are in the process of determining emission reduction targets.</p></sec><sec id="tmi13714-sec-0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper identifies common success factors that facilitate decarbonisation as well as common challenges and how they are being tackled, and makes recommendations on sustainability efforts in academic institutions.</p></sec></abstract>
