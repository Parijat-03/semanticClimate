They are places in which different publics come to explore, play, observe, discover, and perhaps learn some science along the way. Over time, science museums have reinvented themselves, shifting and/or expanding their purposes and functions, and moving through different generations (see Amodio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>; Friedman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; McManus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1992</xref>). Once dominated by a focus on collecting and preserving, and later communicating science through hands-on experiences (Bradbourne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>), science museums are slowly reshaping their identities and social goals to explicitly include and promote active citizenship, social responsibility, engagement with complex science and technology issues, and agency (Achiam &amp; S&#248;lberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>; Barrett &amp; Sutter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; Cameron, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Hine &amp; Medvecky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>; Janes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Koster, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>; Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>; Quistgaard &amp; Kahr-H&#248;jland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2010</xref>; Stocklmayer&#160;et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2010</xref>). Interestingly, this reshaping of science museums echoes similar calls for reforms in formal science education settings (e.g., Bencze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>; Hodson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Roth &amp; Barton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2004</xref>).</p>
