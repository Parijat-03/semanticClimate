Exposure refers to the degree to which a person or population comes into contact with climate change and its consequences, for example, people working outdoors could be more exposed during episodes of extreme heat. Sensitivity refers to certain individual characteristics that make people more susceptible to being affected by a particular climate-related health problem. For example, the following groups are particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures: older adults, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions; children; women (although some studies attribute their sensitivity to their greater longevity); persons with conditions affecting cognitive functioning, mobility and behaviour; and persons taking medication that can affect sweating or interfere with thermoregulation, such as various psychoactive drugs. Finally, the ability to adapt consists of the presence or absence of key resources and/or adaptive behaviours at the individual or population level including a good water supply, sewage and waste management systems, a transport network that allows access to workplaces and other services, as well as a cool space during prolonged periods of extreme heat; the ability of persons living in energy poverty to have a home with adequate conditions during extreme temperatures (for example, air conditioning, cross ventilation and thermal insulation); and migrants with limited knowledge of the local language or area. Both exposure and the ability to adapt are strongly influenced by the various above-mentioned axes of inequality. Strong social cohesion and support networks among individuals, communities and institutions are essential to foster the ability to adapt among vulnerable populations [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
