The availability of food can also be affected by crop damage caused by extreme climate events and yield losses especially in maize and wheat. Mediterranean countries are net importers of cereal and fodder/feeding products. They will therefore be strongly affected by disruptions in global agricultural markets related to climate change effects located in other producing regions. The lack of water will also affect foods typical of the Mediterranean diet, such as tomatoes (a highly water-demanding crop), and olives, currently a rain-fed crop that could become unviable without irrigation [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ecosystem disruption, both through the migration and extinction of native species and the introduction of invasive alien species, can also lead to the loss of classic crops.</p>
