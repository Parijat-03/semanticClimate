Inclusive rural transformation is needed to improve these livelihoods, comprising a process of increasing agricultural productivity and marketable surpluses, while also expanding off-farm employment opportunities, better access to services and infrastructure, and capacity to influence policy (IFAD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>). This is an essential element for achieving inclusive food system transformation (Davis et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>).At the same time, transformative adaptation entailing system level changes to reduce risks to agri-food system-based livelihoods and increase adaptative capacity is needed to confront the challenges climate change imposes on the sector (Fedele et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). These twin challenges demanding transformative change also require transformative levels and approaches to financing. As of today, such financing is not in place.</p>
