      <td>attributable to a weakening South Asian monsoon (Yao et al., 2012a; Palazzi et al., 2013; Roxy et al., 2015). There are contradictory\ntrends in the western HKH (Azmat et al., 2017; Yadav et al., 2017; H. Li et al., 2018; Meher et al., 2018), where most precipitation is\nassociated with western disturbances on the subtropical westerly jet, but trends in western disturbance activity are unclear (Kumar\net al., 2015; Hunt et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019a). There has been an increased frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation\nover the central-western HKH but contrasting evidence in the east (Sheikh et al., 2015; Talchabhadel et al., 2018). The number of\nconsecutive wet days has increased over 1961&#8211;2012, but with no uniform trend in consecutive dry days (Zhan et al., 2017). There is\nmedium confidence that the eastern-central HKH has experienced decreased summer precipitation (Section 10.6.3). There is medium\nconfidence in the increase of summer extreme precipitation over the western HKH.</td>

      <td>including the HKH (high confidence). Glaciers are losing mass (very high confidence) and permafrost is warming (high confidence)\nover high mountains in recent decades, and it is very likely that atmospheric warming is the main driver. A significant reduction in\nHKH glacier area has been observed since the 1970s, with smaller glaciers generally shrinking faster (e.g., Bolch et al., 2019). HKH\nglacier mass loss took place at the lowest rate among high mountain areas in the last 20 years, although with one of the largest\ntotal losses (Section 9.5.1.1 and Figure 9.20; Shean et al., 2020). The highest mass-loss rates occurred in the eastern and northern\nHKH, while gains occurred in the west (e.g., Shean et al., 2020). Glacier mass gain has been coined as the &#8216;Karakoram anomaly&#8217;\n(Sections 8.3.1.7.1 and 9.5.1), explained by a combination of low temperature sensitivity of debris-covered glaciers, a decrease in\nsummer air temperatures, and increased snowfall possibly linked to evapotranspiration from irrigated agriculture (You et al., 2017;\nBolch et al., 2019; de Kok et al., 2020a; Farinotti et al., 2020). Meanwhile, increased air temperature and decreased snowfall explain\nthe glacier mass decrease elsewhere (Bonekamp et al., 2019; de Kok et al., 2020b; Farinotti et al., 2020; Shean et al., 2020). There is\nhigh confidence that glaciers in most HKH regions have thinned, retreated and lost mass since the 1970s.</td>

      <td>South Asia. New CMIP5 results show temperature increases across mountainous HKH by about 1&#176;C&#8211;2&#176;C (in some places in summer\n4&#176;C&#8211;5&#176;C) during 2021&#8211;2050 compared to 1961&#8211;1990 (Shrestha et al., 2015). Projected warming differs by up to 1&#176;C between east and\nwest, with higher values in winter (Sanjay et al., 2017; see Interactive Atlas). Statistically significant mean warming (0.30&#176;C&#8211;0.90&#176;C\nper decade until the end of the 21st century) across all RCPs has been projected by CORDEX South Asia (Dimri et al., 2018). CMIP6\nmodels report that north-western South Asia, including the western Himalayas, is projected to experience temperature increases\nexceeding 6&#176;C by the end of the 21st century under SSP5-8.5 relative to 1995&#8211;2014 (Almazroui et al., 2020b). Results from CMIP5,\nCMIP6 and CORDEX ensembles for different warming levels are shown in the Interactive Atlas and summarized in Figure Atlas.20.\nThe HKH will likely continue warming in the coming decades.</td>

      <td>The SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018b) stated that heavy precipitation risk in high-elevation regions is projected to be higher at 2&#176;C compared to\n1.5&#176;C of global warming (medium confidence). CMIP5 models project increased annual or summer monsoon precipitation over the\nHKH in the 21st century (Palazzi et al., 2015; Kitoh and Arakawa, 2016), intensifying by about 22% in the hilly south-eastern Himalaya\nand TP for the long term in RCP8.5, but with no trends in the western HKH (Rajbhandari et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2019a). CMIP6\nprojects an increase of winter precipitation over the western Himalayas, with a corresponding decrease in the east (Almazroui et al.,\n2020b). HKH projections are subject to large uncertainties in CMIP5 and CORDEX (Hasson et al., 2013, 2017; Mishra, 2015; Sanjay\net al., 2017). CORDEX, in particular, has inherent limitations at reproducing the characteristics of summer monsoon rainfall variability\n(Singh et al., 2017). There is medium confidence that HKH precipitation will increase in the coming decades.</td>

      <td>The SROCC assessed that glaciers will lose substantial mass (high confidence) and permafrost will undergo increasing thaw and\ndegradation (very high confidence) over high mountain regions (including the HKH), with stronger changes for higher emissions\nscenarios. Regional differences in warming and precipitation projections and glacier properties cause considerable differences in\nglacier response within High Mountain Asia (Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017). Glacier mass loss will accelerate through the 21st century,\nincreasing with RCP after 2030 (Section 9.5.1.3; Marzeion et al., 2014). Loss of between 40 &#177; 25% to 69 &#177; 21 % of 2015 glacier\nvolume is expected by 2100 in RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively (Section 9.5.1.3 and Figure 9.21). Glacier mass loss is expected due to\ndecreased snowfall, increased snowline elevations and longer melt seasons. However, due to projection uncertainties, simplicity of the\nmodels, and limited observations, there is medium confidence in the magnitude and timing of glacier mass changes (Section 9.5.1.3).\nGlacier mass in HKH will decline through the 21st century (high confidence), more so under high-emissions scenarios.</td>
