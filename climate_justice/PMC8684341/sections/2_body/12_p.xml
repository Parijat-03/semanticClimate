Struggling for climate justice is not a zero-sum game. The book uses a case study of one corporation&#8212;the Finnish&#8211;Swedish firm Stora Enso&#8212;as a point of departure in each chapter. In Chapter 2, which looks at the colonialism and neocolonial function of the corporation, the discussion turns to Stora Enso&#8217;s huge land holdings in Uruguay and Brazil. De Nardin Bud&#243;&#8217;s writing has previously shown how a struggle by the Brazilian Landless Workers&#8217; Movement (<italic>Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra</italic> or the &#8220;MST&#8221;) in Rio Grande du Sol was successful in removing Stora Enso from the state. This is significant. Transnational capital can be defeated and is defeated regularly. Indeed, the cumulative effect of local struggles can be very substantial indeed. One recent analysis shows that Indigenous struggles in North America have stopped or delayed greenhouse gas pollution that is equivalent to a quarter of the emissions from Canada and the United States (Goldtooth and Saldamando <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). So while we need to secure a final victory against <italic>all</italic> corporations that profit from pollution and environment degradation&#8212;and this means nothing short of ending the system of universal commodification and profit accumulation&#8212;the struggle against <italic>individual</italic> capitals in the form of specific corporations and specific groups of investors is crucial for the planet.</p>
