In 2019, within the framework of the Fall Institute of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, we organized the workshop &#8220;Planning for climate change&#8221; in the city of Barcelona [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The workshop brought together dozens of experts from different fields and aimed to identify the elements of a public health surveillance system to monitor climate change, its determinants and its effects on health. Through plenary sessions and discussions in small multidisciplinary groups, a preliminary list of topics and indicators was outlined. The workshop also identified the need to: (1) develop a shared conceptual framework adapted to the specificities of cities with a Mediterranean climate, in order to build the monitoring system and guide design and evaluation of health-focused mitigation and adaptation policies; and (2) include equity and justice as key considerations.</p>
