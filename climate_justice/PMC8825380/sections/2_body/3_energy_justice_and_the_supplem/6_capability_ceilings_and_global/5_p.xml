Either way, the risk of pushing individuals, either current or future, below the threshold of capabilities becomes more severe. If a first generation in a sequence of generations expected to mitigate does not reduce emissions, it will force the immediately subsequent generation to significantly reduce their emissions (Gardiner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>) and possibly to accept that not all from that generation will reach the threshold required by justice. The tragedy of that policy would be that it pushes people below the threshold, as increasingly aggressive mitigation policies would be required. Alternatively, that second generation could behave as the preceding generation. This will mean that the third generation will face an even more severe challenge of picking up the slack for two generations. Eventually, dangerous climate change will set in, which will most likely substantially increase the number of people who are pushed below the threshold for many more capabilities than those covered by the HDI and relevant to energy justice.</p>
