Did the Crown prosecutors and judge really have to <italic>deny the certainty</italic> of climate change? Was the suspension of climate change as an imminent peril vital to make this injunction seem legitimate? Several inter-relating issues converge here. Canada's legal system has less case law on the necessity defence compared to some other countries, including the United Kingdom (UK). After the defence's case referenced legal precedents from the UK and the United States where some courts have upheld necessity defences, the Crown argued that laws internationally are not relevant to Canada's &#8220;imminence&#8221; requirement. Prosecutors also contended that since some cases cited by the defence were not &#8220;<italic>injunction</italic>&#8221;-specific civil disobedience (even if they were cases of civil disobedience doing far more disruption), they were not relevant. The Crown's argument that there was no &#8220;close temporal connection&#8221; between perceived threats and climate impacts further underscored how an injunction can be used to advance &#8220;the production of colonial ecological violence&#8221; (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bacon, 2019</xref>) by more than simply burying truths but actively fomenting untruths in de-linking <italic>time</italic>
