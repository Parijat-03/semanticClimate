The SDGs express this nuance when acknowledging its agenda&#8217;s &#8220;historic&#8221; and &#8220;far-reaching&#8221; character anno 2015 (SDGs, 2). In the PA and in the Encyclical, the same perspective is formulated as the &#8220;long-term global response&#8221; (PA, 7.2) related to the macro-level norm of the &#8220;long-term common good&#8221; (Enc., 178). In this sense, a long-term process corresponds with reducing or slowing down the rate of change at the meso-level, which is challenging to some extent the accelerative reduction of ethical accountability to mere techno-scientific countability. This very significant transformation of accelerative centralistic processes on the meso-level into more decentralized dynamical patterns helps to avoid a lock-in situation in SD. We will show that temporally diverse and truly decentralized meso-level SD depends on autonomous bottom-up processes. As laid out in the following, all three documents indicate that deceleration, the inverse of acceleration, has to be accounted for in relation to the micro-level.</p>
