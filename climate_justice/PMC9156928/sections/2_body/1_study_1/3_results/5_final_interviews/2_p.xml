Based on the quantitative results above, the final interview script was structured to address two main questions: (1) what prevented participants from attending the online activism events? and (2) what led to the change in the psychological factors that a) increased on average across participants (affective engagement, self-efficacy and collective efficacy) and b) increased for an individual participant (i.e. at least +2 out of 7 on a factor)? Finally, participants were asked their opinion on ways to better design this study to achieve greater activist engagement.</p>
