<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0190">The intimidation tactics at play here were powerful components of what <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Valdivia (2008</xref>, p. 464) calls &#8220;petroleum colonization&#8221; (in her context, discussing Ecuador) &#8211; where authority is never just about controlling land and resources but also entangling people, emotion and social relations in asymmetrical power relations. Critiquing the use of injunctions, contempt hearings and cost awards as tactics of intimidation in Canada, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Mayada (2010)</xref> argued a decade ago for adopting measures to make it &#8220;more difficult for private individuals, corporations, and government to use the threat of imprisonment and crippling cost awards to dissuade aboriginal and environmental protestors from vindicating their rights&#8221;; he noted that &#8220;it is not unusual for the Crown to take over private prosecutions&#8221; in controversial cases around moral and Indigenous rights matters and stresses benefits of that. Here, the reverse was done. One defendant expressed her understanding that she could face a 7-day jail term if she took action on Burnaby Mountain but she fully expected to face the Crown, which cannot seek court costs. By professing his willingness to award costs the judge set yet another new precedent in this saga &#8211; a precursor to larger looming conflicts ahead, as discussed below, amid reconfigured solidarity-building and ethics of care linking the court space and beyond. The inconsistent rationales and dynamics of intimidation here reflect how the injunction was used to <italic>suspend</italic> not simply norms about the public's relation to territory<xref rid="fn10" ref-type="fn">10</xref>
or the socio-political possibilities of rights, but also truth and time itself.</p>
