they often become fluent in claiming their right to the city. Working through the
critical pedagogies examined in this paper, we see that such fluency is not acquired
spontaneously or individually, but as the outcome of collective learning processes
that turn habitat struggles into sites of transformative change by linking learning
with mobilization, advocacy and action.</p>
