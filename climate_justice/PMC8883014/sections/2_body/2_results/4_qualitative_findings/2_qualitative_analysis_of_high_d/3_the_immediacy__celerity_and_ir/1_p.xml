Their awareness of a countdown was distressful (&#8220;something that really scared me was the clock in New York. It is scary knowing we have such little time until we see catastrophe&#8221;) and led them to question the responsibility of bringing &#8220;kids into a world that is currently on a climate clock.&#8221; The <bold>irreversibility</bold> of an upcoming &#8220;permanent damage&#8221; was stressed by the participants. Not only did some participants refer to irreversible changes (e.g., &#8220;we will no longer be able to see the world as it is&#8221;), but others also went so far as to describe the world as &#8220;dying at a rapid rate.&#8221;</p>
