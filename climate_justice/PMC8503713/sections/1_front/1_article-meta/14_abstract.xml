Across the globe, food sovereignty activists and allies have organized autonomous counter-mobilizations, including in Asia and the Pacific, to share what a radical transformation of our food and agriculture systems should really look like. This article shares the peoples&#8217; proposals and current grassroots activities towards radical food systems transformation that were shared at the Asia Pacific peoples&#8217; regional dialogue.</p></abstract>
