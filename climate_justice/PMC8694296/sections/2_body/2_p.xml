<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Glasgow agreement particularly fails low-income countries. The United States and the European Union refused to create a new fund that low-income countries could draw on for crisis responses, even though&#8212;as all the papers in this special section acknowledge&#8212;low-income countries are far more exposed than high-income countries to loss and damage from adverse climate impacts. Christian Aid delivered a report to COP26 showing that, under current climate policies, the most vulnerable and &#8220;least developed countries&#8221; can expect to see climate change reducing their GDP by 19.6% by 2050 and by 63.9% by 2100. If governments limit global heating to 1.5&#186;C, then the damage would be reduced but would remain significant. In a 1.5&#186;C world, these nations would see their GDP hit by 13.1% by 2050 and 33.1% by 2100.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
