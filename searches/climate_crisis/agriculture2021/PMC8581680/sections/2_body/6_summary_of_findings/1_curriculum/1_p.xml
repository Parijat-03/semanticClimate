<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Planetary health and sustainable healthcare education are evident in the core curriculum - particularly following the introduction of the new medical C25 curriculum in 2020 - and various elective courses. One of the themes of the C25 curriculum, titled &#8216;Global and Population Health&#8217; has enabled the longitudinal integration of planetary health subtopics into the core curriculum. This is integrated at a practical level, for example: discussions about a vegan diet due to concerns about the agricultural impact on the environment are included in a case concerning a patient with anaemia. In the comparative PHRC, QUB was highlighted as a good example within the metric of Curriculum due to the presence of this core longitudinal theme and its subtheme entitled &#8220;Social Accountability and Sustainable Healthcare&#8221; - these subthemes aim to highlight to students that, regardless of their stage of training, they must address the priority of health concerns that mandate wherever they serve. It also highlights some of the concerns they will face, including the impact of the healthcare system on climate change and the government&#8217;s commitment to a Net-Zero NHS by 2050. The availability of numerous Student Selected Components (SSCs) also led QUB to be highlighted as an exemplar in the Curriculum metric. SSCs included are &#8220;Healthcare Needs Smaller Feet &#8211; Sustainable Healthcare: Theory into Practice&#8221;, &#8220;SusQI&#8221; and &#8220;Global Health: Concepts, Trends and Priorities&#8221;, all of which involve discussions on sustainability within clinical practice and climate change. The new curriculum was only implemented within the last year (2020-21) and whilst making great strides in planetary health education, there is room for improvement, and in the coming years, planetary health will continue to develop as an integral part of the curriculum.</p>
