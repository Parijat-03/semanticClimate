<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Meanwhile, in settings with significant numbers of landless or land-poor, and thus in need of land redistribution and restitution but there are no existing appropriate policies or laws, the mainstream strategy deployed has been to <italic toggle="yes">block</italic> any land policy that is redistributive or restitutive in character. A classic example is Myanmar where the World Bank, USAID and other international agencies that were advising the government (before the February 2021 military coup) pushed for market-oriented land policies, essentially blocking the possibility of system-wide redistributive and restitutive land policies (Ra et al., <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Ra &amp; Ju, <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The cases of Brazil, Philippines, South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Colombia, already mentioned, are among the few exceptions: no other national redistributive land policy has been passed or implemented during the neoliberal period, despite the unprecedented levels of land concentration established or maintained by neoliberalism. The Indonesian BAL of 1960 has been retained but kept dormant. Even those laws and policies that have sought to regulate the frenzied land rush of the past decade have been applied only peripherally; regulation has been used in order to facilitate large-scale land deals by minimizing collateral damage such as expulsions of affected villagers without monetary compensation. Arguably, the most pervasive form of the blocking strategy is having a &#8216;no policy&#8217; policy. This refers to societies where there is a compelling case for redistributive land policies, but where governments choose not to adopt any policies to achieve this end.</p>
