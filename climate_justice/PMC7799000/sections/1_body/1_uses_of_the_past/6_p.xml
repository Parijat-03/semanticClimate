Places such the Smithsonian Institution have safety offices, and the curators are often at odds with the safety office. It's great that they want to make sure nobody gets sick. With the 9/11 collecting, we had we had many run-ins. We collected Mayor Rudy Giuliani's boots that were covered with dust, which was the point&#8212;those boots proved that he was there walking through the site. The safety officer said that they were really dangerous. And we had months of back-and-forth conversations. We did all sorts of expensive testing to determine whether they were dangerous.</p>
