<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As reported by Prathibha [<xref rid="B42-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it is important to curb the effect of environmental conditions on crop yield output. To do this, an efficient measurement method of the elements of weather might be required. Prathibha&#8217;s research, therefore, proposed a CC3200 combined sensor unit, which comprises a processor for network, a micro-controller, a Wi-Fi unit, a camera, as well as temperature and humidity sensors. This weather utility device comes as a portable unit with low power consumption for longer battery-life. The system monitors temperature (using a thermopile sensor that uses infrared technology) and humidity across the agricultural field, which are subsequently processed as camera images and sent via Wi-Fi to the farmer&#8217;s mobile phone as multi-media messages. Information of this nature helps the farmer to know how good the soil water is to support the grown crop. A similar study [<xref rid="B43-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] designed another unit that can also send immediate signals to a farmer, after recording real-time data on weather, in and around the farm. This unit was made up of a breadboard, a combination of sensors that can monitor UV Index/IR/Visible light (SI1145 Digital Sensor), soil moisture content, humidity, temperature (DHT11), an ESP32s Node MCU, all of which are connected to a monitor, which is in turn linked remotely to the famer&#8217;s mobile phone, using an LED visual alert and Blynk mobile phone application. Two very special characteristics of this unit are; its ability to save power in sleep mode, for a battery life that averages 10 days, and the speed of sending signal (180 s) [<xref rid="B43-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. </p>
