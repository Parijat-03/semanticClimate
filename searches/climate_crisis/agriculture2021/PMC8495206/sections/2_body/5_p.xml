<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0006">Regardless of many warnings from climate research scientists and the wider communities, the whole world is still suffering from the general lack of immediate actions to address the climate crisis. The next UN Climate Change Conference &#8211; COP26 in October, 2021, will see how much and how far governments around the world are willing to commit to global climate targets and individual countries&#8217; actions. For low-income and middle-income countries, the situation is even more critical with financial resources lacking amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the challenges for tackling climate measures are even greater. The Americas are home to diverse human populations, and stark disparities in the access to resources exist between countries in the region and even within a single country. Climate challenges can serve as a catalyst for every country in the Americas to unite and help one another. Nature has been sending its messages louder each day and it is no longer possible to ignore them. It is time for leaders in the Americas to step up and take practical actions to mitigate temperature rises and pollution, adapt to changes, mobilise finances, and collaborate with the rest of the world, as per COP26 goals.</p>
