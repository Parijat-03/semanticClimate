In contrast to the other monsoons it extends quite far north, out of the tropical belt, and it is largely influenced by subtropical systems and by disturbances from the mid-latitudes. The EAsiaM manifests during boreal summer with warm and wet southerly winds, but also during boreal winter with cold and dry northerly winds. In late April/early May, rainfall onsets in the central Indochina Peninsula, and in mid-June the rainy season arrives over East Asia with the formation of the Meiyu front along the Yangtze River valley, Changma in Korea and Baiu in Japan. In July, the monsoon advances up to North China, the Korean peninsula and central Japan. During boreal winter, strong north-westerlies manifest over north and north-east China, Korea and Japan, while strong north-easterlies arrive along the coast of East Asia.

The WAfriM is characterized by the northward progression from May to September of moist low-level south-westerlies from the Gulf of Guinea. In May and June, rainfall essentially remains along the Guinean coast with a maximum occurring near 5&#176;N, followed by a sudden decrease of rainfall, marking the &#8216;short dry season&#8216; in the Guinean coast and the monsoon onset in the Sahel. Then rainfall continues to progress northward up to about 18&#8211;20&#176;N, with a maximum near 12&#176;N in late August/September, until it retreats starting from October towards the Guinean coast for a second maximum.

The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) defines the start of the Holocene Epoch at 11,700 years before 2000 (Walker et al., 2019) spanning the interval from 11,700 yr to the present day. Together with the subadjacent Pleistocene, it comprises the Quaternary System/Period. The Holocene record contains diverse geomorphological, biological, climatological and archaeological evidence, within sequences that are often continuous and extremely well-preserved at decadal, annual and even seasonal resolution. As a consequence, the Holocene is perhaps the most intensively   studied series/epoch within the entire Geological Time Scale. Yet until recently little attention had been paid to a formal subdivision of the Holocene. Here we describe an initiative by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS. It encompasses the mid-Holocene (MH), the 1000-year-long interval centred at 6000 years before 1950; a period of long-standing focus for climate modelling, with enhanced seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere and decreased seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere. The early part of the Holocene is marked by the late stages of </span><span  class="s100">deglaciation </span><span  class="s1000">of Pleistocene land ice, sea level rise, and the occurrence of warm phases that affected different regions at different times, often referred to as the &#8216;Holocene Thermal Maximum&#8217;.

Earth deformation associated with adding water to the oceans and a shift of the Earth&#8217;s rotation axis towards the source of terrestrial mass loss leads to second-order effects that increase spatial variability of the pattern globally.
