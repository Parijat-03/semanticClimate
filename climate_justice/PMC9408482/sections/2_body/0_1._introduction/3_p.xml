<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To achieve the goal of the PA by the end of this century (in the long run), at COP26 in Glasgow last year (2021), all party countries stressed the need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 45 percent in this decade (by 2030) and net zero emissions by 2050 (in the short run). It requires accelerated action for emission reduction from all party countries and leveling up support from the developed countries to the developing and least developed countries. All party countries have submitted their initial NDC targets where the LDPCs have informed their needs under Articles 9, 10, and 11 of the PA.</p>
