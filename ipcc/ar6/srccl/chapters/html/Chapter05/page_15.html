Through changing metabolic demands and physiological stress for people exposed to extreme temperatures, there is also the potential for interactions with food availability; people may require more food to cope, whilst at the same time being impaired from producing it (Watts et al. 2018). All these factors have the potential to alter both physical health as well as cultural health, through changing the amount, safety and quality of food available for individuals within their cultural context.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="207.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.42; y0: 207.13; y1: 216.63; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="207.13" x1="313.25">This section assesses recent literature on climate change impacts on the four pillars of food security: availability (Section&#160;5.2.2), access (Section&#160;5.2.3), utilisation (Section&#160;5.2.4), and stability (Section&#160;5.2.5).

Climate drivers relevant to food production and availability may be categorised as modal climate changes (e.g.,&#160;shifts in climate envelopes causing shifts in cropping varieties planted), seasonal changes (e.g.,&#160;warming trends extending growing seasons), extreme events (e.g., high temperatures affecting critical growth periods, flooding/droughts), and atmospheric conditions for example, CO</span><span style="x0: 430.59; x1: 433.78; y0: 326.92; y1: 333.57; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="430.59" y0="326.92" x1="433.78">2</span><span style="x0: 439.38; x1: 443.07; y0: 327.11; y1: 336.61; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="439.38" y0="327.11" x1="571.76">concentrations, short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), and dust.

Potential changes in major modes of climate variability can also have widespread impacts such as those that occurred during late 2015 to early 2016 when a&#160;strong El Ni&#241;o contributed to regional shifts in precipitation in the Sahel region.
