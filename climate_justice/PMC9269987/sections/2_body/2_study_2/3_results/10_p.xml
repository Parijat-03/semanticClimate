In step 1 of the mediation model, the regression of pro-environmental intention on perpetrator sensitivity, ignoring the mediator, was significant, &#946; = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 2 showed that the regression of the mediator (guilt) on perpetrator sensitivity was also significant, &#946; = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 3 of the mediation analysis showed that the mediator (guilt), controlling for perpetrator sensitivity, significantly predicted pro-environmental intention, &#946; = 0.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 4 of the analysis revealed that controlling for the mediator (guilt), the predictive power of beneficiary sensitivity on pro-environmental intention was reduced, &#946; = 0.23, <italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.001. Again, a Sobel Test showed that this mediation is significant (<italic>z</italic> = 5.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Therefore, guilt partially mediated the relationship between perpetrator sensitivity and pro-environmental intention. The second mediation analysis is also illustrated in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
