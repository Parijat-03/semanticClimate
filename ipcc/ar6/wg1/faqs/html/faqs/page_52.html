How Long Would It Take for Them to Grow Back?</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.76" top="651.96"><span style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 651.96; y1: 660.96; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="69.02" y0="651.96" x1="539.76">Evidence from the distant past shows that some parts of the Earth system might take hundreds to thousands of years to fully adjust to changes in climate. This means that some of the consequences of human-induced climate change will continue for a&#160;very long time, even if atmospheric heat-trapping gas levels and global temperatures are stabilized or reduced in the future. This is especially true for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which grow much more slowly than they retreat. If the current melting of these ice sheets continues for long enough, it becomes effectively irreversible on human time scales, as does the sea level rise caused by that melting.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.78" top="573.97"><span x0="69.02" y0="573.97" x1="539.78" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 573.97; y1: 582.97; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Humans are changing the climate and there are mechanisms that amplify the warming in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic). The Arctic is already warming faster than anywhere else (see FAQ 4.3). This is significant because these colder high latitudes are home to our two remaining ice sheets: Antarctica and Greenland. Ice sheets are huge reservoirs of frozen freshwater, built up by tens of thousands of years of snowfall. If they were to completely melt, the water released would raise global sea level by about 65 m. Understanding how these ice sheets are affected by warming of nearby ocean and atmosphere is therefore critically important. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are already slowly responding to recent changes in climate, but it takes a&#160;long time for these huge masses of ice to adjust to changes in global temperature. That means that the full effects of a&#160;warming climate may take hundreds or thousands of years to play out. An important question is whether these changes can eventually be reversed, once levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are stabilized or reduced by humans and natural processes. Records from the past can help us answer this question.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.83" top="436.0"><span x0="69.02" y0="436.0" x1="539.83" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 436.0; y1: 445.0; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">For at least the last 800,000 years, the Earth has followed cycles of gradual cooling followed by rapid warming caused by natural processes. During cooling phases, more and more ocean water is gradually deposited as snowfall, causing ice sheets to grow and sea level to slowly decrease. During warming phases, the ice sheets melt more quickly, resulting in more rapid rises in sea level (FAQ 9.1, Figure&#160;1). Ice sheets build up very slowly because growth relies on the steady accumulation of falling snow that eventually compacts into ice. As the climate cools, areas that can accumulate snow expand, reflecting back more sunlight that otherwise would keep the Earth warmer. This means that, once started, glacial climates develop rapidly. However, as the climate cools, the amount of moisture that the air can hold tends to decrease. As a&#160;result, even though glaciations begin quite quickly, it takes tens of thousands of years for ice sheets to grow to a&#160;point where they are in balance with the colder climate.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="310.03"><span x0="69.02" y0="310.03" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 71.53; y0: 310.03; y1: 319.03; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Ice sheets retreat more quickly than they grow because of processes that, once triggered, drive self-reinforcing ice loss.

In this situation, the altitude of the ice-sheet surface decreases as it melts, exposing the sheet to warmer air. The lowered surface then melts even more, lowering it faster still, until eventually the whole ice sheet disappears.

This happens when the part of the ice sheet that is surrounded by sea water melts. That leads to additional thinning, which in turn accelerates the motion of the glaciers that feed into these areas. As the ice sheet flows more quickly into the ocean, more melting takes place, leading to more thinning and even faster flow that brings ever-more glacier ice into the ocean, ultimately driving rapid deglaciation of whole ice-sheet drainage basins.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.86" top="160.06"><span x0="69.02" y0="160.06" x1="539.86" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 160.06; y1: 169.06; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">These (and other) self-reinforcing processes explain why relatively small increases in temperature in the past led to very substantial sea level rise over centuries to millennia, compared to the many tens of thousands of years it takes to grow the ice sheets that lowered the sea level in the first place. These insights from the past imply that, if human-induced changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets continue for the rest of this century, it will take thousands of years to reverse that melting, even if global air temperatures decrease within this or the next century. In this sense, these changes are therefore irreversible, since the ice sheets would take much longer to regrow than the decades or centuries for which modern society is able to plan.</span></div></body></html>
