<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0090">Poverty is often attributable to access to resources instead of a lack of resources. This stylised fact becomes compelling when it comes to food, energy, water and natural resources. Empirical evidence shows that famine and starvation can be mostly due to the poor's lack of access to assets, including finance (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gatto, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Sen, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Dreze and Sen, 1989</xref>) &#8211; a feature that corroborates the capability approach conclusions and its interplays with sustainable and local development (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gatto, 2020</xref>). Modern access to financial tools must be, therefore, considered a human right.</p>
