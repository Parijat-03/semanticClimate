<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0550">Advancing innovation across food systems will require the proper enabling environment for private-sector engagement, including a fresh look at public&#8211;private partnerships and interactions with the research community. During the recovery process, governments will need to send clear signals about facilitating the transition and transformation of sectors toward greater sustainability and resilience. Initiatives to translate the SDGs and corresponding targets into meaningful, actionable targets for the private sector should be reinforced and expanded. Creating a marketplace for ideas on agricultural and food systems innovation will be important to facilitate the translation of applied research into implementation.</p>
