Domestically, a tobacco control advocate can employ human rights arguments when encouraging local law makers to create new tobacco control policy, for example, illustrating that smoke-free policies help to ensure the human right to a healthy environment. Internationally, advocates can submit parallel reports to human rights treaty bodies (such as a report on how the children of their country are impacted by tobacco, submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child), or even advocate at the Human Rights Council, where tobacco control efforts should be evaluated as part of countries&#8217; Universal Periodic Reviews. There are many opportunities to engage in a human rights-based approach to tobacco control, and advocates should be taking advantage of as many as possible.</p>
