Underlying differences in terms of health and social care system organisation, service provision models and pre-existing epidemiological context have resulted in heterogeneous scenarios for burden of disease (BoD) distribution, both in terms of COVID-19-specific outcomes, and because of collateral damage, not only across, but also within countries and regions. Individual proximal factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, underlying comorbidities and perception of risk have contributed to increased individual risk of acquiring the infection and of developing severe disease complications, including death. In addition, systemic issues, i.e., individual financial capacity, legal status, and acute versus chronic care needs have affected access both to care and commodity. From the global health perspective, we are also witnessing determinants threatening sustainable development, with tremendous differences in terms of capacity to combat the disease and deploy disease control measures, as well as ensure financial stability, economic growth and societal resilience. Ensuring equitable allocation of test, vaccines and medicines, and the development of comprehensive strategies necessitates a deeper understanding of those at most at risk, with due protection to those most vulnerable across the world. A comprehensive approach to tackle all these challenges, whilst ensuring due consideration is paid to ethical and legal issues, necessitates sound understanding of determinants, vulnerability with systematic measurement and interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral collaboration. This RT will bring the perspective of academia, researchers and practitioners in the field, and NGOs, offering insights on emerging research, practice and strategies. It aims to broker dialogue, to identify key steps to counter the damaging effect of inequities to social cohesion and system resilience, and to inform policy making and global public health actions.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Key messages</title><p>
