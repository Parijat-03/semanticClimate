Sharing and collaborating online is clearly a challenge but clinicians can take an intentional approach to fostering such collaboration. We need to build shared understandings of how to collaborate effectively. This comes from how clinic staff, including supervisors, work with students and clients. Having staff model the types of collaborative approaches they want students to adopt will be particularly important. It will also be valuable to have students work on team-based activities, using technology to foster both formal and informal conversations. Students can spend time in different teams during their clinical experience. Clinicians should emphasise to students that modern legal work, and professional work more generally, is increasingly conducted in team-based arrangements. Collaborative learning can be further enhanced by having students share their respective experiences through a carefully designed classroom component linked to their practice-based experience. Creating a clinic environment where students feel safe and comfortable to share their experiences is an important first step to fostering broader collaboration.</p>
