<disp-quote><p>In the hillsides of Medell&#237;n, members of <italic toggle="yes">Fuerza
Incluyente</italic>, a collective of people with disabilities, wait
for a taxi to get to the city centre. As a taxi driver stops, the group
engages in a conversation with him, first showing him how to dismantle
and store a wheelchair in the taxi boot. Then, Nancy &#8211; who has short
upper limbs &#8211; takes a seat and instructs the taxi driver to put her
seatbelt on. On their way, the conversation covers a range of topics &#8211;
from Nancy sharing her experience with verbal abuse, to the ways in
which people with disabilities can be addressed in a dignified manner.
At the end of their ride, she hands the taxi driver a sticker to put
behind his windshield (see <xref rid="fig3-09562478221115334" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It declares him an
&#8220;inclusive taxi driver&#8221;, that is, one of many transport providers across
the city who have taken part in a pedagogic experience of learning from
people with disabilities and who commit to practising inclusive
transport services.<sup>(<xref rid="fn31-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">31</xref>)</sup></p></disp-quote>
