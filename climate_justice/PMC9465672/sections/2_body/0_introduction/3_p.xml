Extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes) and slow-onset processes (e.g., seawater rise) have changed the living conditions of locals and may trigger a perception of insecurity that prompts them to abandon, permanently or temporarily, their houses and other assets by migrating to other regions or countries (Berchin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>: 147, 149). In this context, many islanders can quickly be transformed into what have been called "climate migrants", "climate refugees", or "environmental refugees"&#160;(e.g., Black, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Farbotko &amp; Lazrus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Berchin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>), especially when they live in authoritarian, failed or fragile states.</p>
