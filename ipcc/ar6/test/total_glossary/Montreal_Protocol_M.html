It controls the consumption and production of chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals that destroy <em>stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</em>, such as <em>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</em>, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and many others.&nbsp;Since the Kigali Amendment in 2016, <em>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</em>, which were used as alternatives to <em>ozone-depleting substances (ODSs)</em>, have been targeted for a phase-down due to their <em>climate</em> effect as <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em>.</p></dd><div>
