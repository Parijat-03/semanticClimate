<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Bangladesh has translated Agenda 2030 at the national level by formulating a Perspective Plan (2010&#8211;2021) and through bringing the SDGs into its seventh Five Year Plan 2016&#8211;2020 (Government of Bangladesh <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>). A &#8220;Whole of Society&#8221; approach involves all development partners &#8211; multi and bilateral agencies, NGOs and civil society, the private sector and media, in interpreting and implementing the SDGs. A SDGs Implementation and Monitoring Committee has been formed at the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office to facilitate the implementation of the SDG Action Plan. The country exhibits a generally positive commitment to gender equality at the policy level (Jafry <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the Global Gender Gap Index for 2016 (World Economic Forum <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) suggests there is still some way to go, ranking Bangladesh 72nd out of 144 countries. It recorded improvements with respect to women&#8217;s political empowerment, but a widening of the gender gap with respect to women&#8217;s labour force participation and estimated earned income. These mixed findings are reflected in the Women in Agriculture Empowerment Index (WEAI) for Bangladesh (Sraboni, Quisumbing, and Ahmed <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>
