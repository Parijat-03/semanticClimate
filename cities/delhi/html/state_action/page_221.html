Timely dissemination of information and capacity building efforts are critical to aid practical application of knowledge. Application of knowledge Communication of knowledge helps bridge information asymmetry that is critical for any action on climate change. Timely dissemination of information could help enhance the adaptive capacities of vulnerable communities, it could help government to better mobilize resources and money during a climatic extreme. However, low capacity of many stakeholders to assess the credibility and relevance of the available knowledge has been a barrier to respond appropriately to challenges of climate change. Therefore training and capacity building activities are equally critical for the strategic mission. These activities could range from short term training, mentoring and coaching assistance to enhance the capacity of various government officials, research institutions, policy makers and corporates; or a longer term strategy to create manpower for undertaking climate change research. </span></div></body></html>
