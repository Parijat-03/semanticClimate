Xi committed China to peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. These targets were included in the outline of the 14th 5-year plan (2021&#8211;2025), which also set targets for CO2 and energy intensity reductions by 2025 (Xinhua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2021a</xref>). The Party has emphasised the ambition of the &#8216;30/60 targets&#8217;, describing them as a &#8216;tough battle&#8217; and &#8216;a major test of the party&#8217;s capabilities in governing the country&#8217; (Xinhua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021b</xref>).</p>
