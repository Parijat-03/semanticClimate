<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0345">A significant issue emerges: none of the studied SDGs concerns the environmental dimension, signalling an important flaw within the Agenda and room for improvements. Besides, also the institutional dimension seems not to be adequately covered. This policy delay is reflected by unprompted academic and business actions. This issue shall be punctually addressed, especially in light of the increasing relevance attributed by domestic governments and intergovernmental organisations to the ecological transition. Here are suggested some swift solutions for tackling this environmental and institutional delay proposing simultaneous development and resilience governance by means of policy, research and practical action to build on upcoming outcomes.</p>
