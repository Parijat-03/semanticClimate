By recognising the different forms in which mobility injustice is produced and reproduced, they demand procedurally just approaches to how different groups are approached and participate in policymaking and research. In taking responsibility for building a practice of just mobilities, they highlight the dangers of proposing interventions premised on a universal disembodied subject without accounting for the differential voices, knowledges, experiences, abilities and rhythms of the actors that inhabit particular spaces and places. They also show how these differences are enabled or constrained by policy frameworks themselves. Through their geographical diversity, the studies add weight to the claim that &#8216;fast&#8217; policies (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Peck and Theodore, 2015</xref>) that are swiftly transferred from one place to another and legitimised through discourses of &#8216;modernisation&#8217; and &#8216;sustainability&#8217;, such as Bus Rapid Transit development or bans on informal transport, can create multiple forms of mobility injustice.</p>
