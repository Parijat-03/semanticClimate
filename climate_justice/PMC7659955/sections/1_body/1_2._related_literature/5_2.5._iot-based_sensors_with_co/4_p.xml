<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By using a pre-coded algorithm, also known as the &#8220;<italic>Cuckoo Search Algorithm</italic>&#8221; [<xref rid="B44-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], a framework for automated watering of a piece of farmland was designed. Based on pre-analysis of different kinds of soils, the researchers found that a soil moisture value of 700 meant dry, and would require immediate watering. The IoT sensor was, therefore, designed on the basis of this information, comprising the so-called ThingSpeak, which also gives direction on the most suitable soil type for a specific crop. A temperature-based sensor was initially used on the soil, and the result was sent to a converter called Arduino. Depending on the measured value, the Arduino was connected to an automated watering system, which could be controlled from the mobile device handled by the farmer. When soil wetting gets to optimal levels, the soil sensor sends a feedback signal to the farmer who then stops the watering [<xref rid="B44-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
