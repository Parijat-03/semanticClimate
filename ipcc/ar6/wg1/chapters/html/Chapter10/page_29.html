Regional climate projections are then generated by replacing the quasi-observed predictors by those from climate model (typically global model) projections. Predictor patterns that are common to observations and climate model data can be defined by common empirical orthogonal functions (Benestad, 2011). The perfect prognosis approach can either be used to generate daily (or even sub-daily) time series, or local weather statistics (e.g.,&#160;Benestad&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="570.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="570.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regression-like models (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b) rely on a&#160;transfer function linking an observed local statistic (such as the temperature at a&#160;given day) to some set of large-scale predictors. Recent developments include stochastic regression models to explicitly&#160;simulate local variability (San-Mart&#237;n et&#160;al., 2017; those explicitly modelling temporal dependence are assessed in Section&#160;10.3.1.3.4). The use of machine learning techniques has been reinvigorated, including genetic programming to construct a&#160;data-driven model structure (Zerenner et&#160;al., 2016) and deep and convolutional neural networks (Reichstein et&#160;al., 2019; Ba&#241;o-Medina&#160;et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="438.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="438.6" x1="304.72" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Analogue methods (Martin et&#160;al., 1996; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b) compare a&#160;simulated large-scale atmospheric field with an archive of observations and select, using some distance metric, the closest observed field in the archive. The downscaled atmospheric field is then chosen as the local atmospheric field observed on the instant the analogue occurred. New analogue methods have been developed to simulate unobserved values including a&#160;rescaling of the analogue (Pierce et&#160;al., 2014) or by combining analogues and regression models (Chardon et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="154.06" top="318.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.25; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="56.69" y0="318.6" x1="154.06">10.3.1.3.2 Bias adjustment</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.71" top="294.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="294.6" x1="304.71" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Bias adjustment is a&#160;statistical post-processing technique used to pragmatically reduce the mismatch between the statistics of climate model output and observations. The approach estimates the bias or relative error between a&#160;chosen simulated statistical property (such as the long-term mean or specific quantiles of the climatological distribution) and that observed over a&#160;calibration period; the simulated statistic is then adjusted taking into account the simulated deviation. Bias adjustment methods are regularly applied on a&#160;spatial scale similar to that of the simulation being adjusted, but they are often used as a&#160;simple statistical downscaling method by calibrating them between coarse resolution (e.g.,&#160;global) model output and finer observations (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="138.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="138.6" x1="304.77" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Typical implementations of bias adjustment are (i) additive adjustments, where the model data is adjusted by adding a&#160;constant, (ii) rescaling, where the model data is adjusted by a&#160;factor, and (iii)&#160;more flexible quantile mapping approaches that adjust different ranges of a&#160;distribution individually. Hempel et&#160;al. (2013), Pierce et&#160;al. (2015), Switanek et&#160;al. (2017), and Lange (2019) developed variants of quantile mapping that preserve trends in the mean or even further distributional statistics.

Implementations remove biases in (i) specific measures of multivariate dependence, like correlation structure, via linear transformations (B&#225;rdossy and Pegram, 2012; Cannon, 2016), or, more flexibly, (ii) the full multivariate distribution via non-linear transformations (Vrac and Friederichs, 2015; Dekens et&#160;al., 2017; Cannon, 2018; Vrac, 2018; Robin et&#160;al., 2019). Other research strands focus on the explicit separation of bias adjustment and downscaling (Section&#160;10.3.1.3.5), or the integration of process understanding (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017), such as by conditioning the adjustment on the occurrence of relevant phenomena (Addor et&#160;al., 2016; Verfaillie et&#160;al., 2017; Manzanas and Guti&#233;rrez, 2019). Some authors suggest to mitigate the influence of large-scale temperature or circulation biases by performing a&#160;bias adjustment of the driving fields prior to dynamical downscaling (Colette et&#160;al., 2012; Hern&#225;ndez-D&#237;az et&#160;al., 2013, 2019). Issues that may arise when using bias adjustment are discussed in Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.2.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="446.35" top="498.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.77; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="315.21" y0="498.6" x1="446.35">10.3.1.3.3 Delta-change approaches</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="474.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="474.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 474.6; y1: 484.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the delta change approach, selected observations are modified according to corresponding changes derived from dynamical model simulations. Traditionally, only long-term means have been adjusted, but recently approaches to modify temporal dependence (Webber et&#160;al., 2018) have been developed, as well as quantile mapping approaches that individually adjust quantiles of the observed distribution (Willems and Vrac, 2011). By construction, the approach cannot modify the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the input observations (Maraun, 2016).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="426.23" top="354.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.77; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="315.21" y0="354.6" x1="426.23">10.3.1.3.4 Weather generators</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="330.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="330.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.77; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Weather generators are statistical models that simulate weather time series of arbitrary length. They are calibrated to represent observed weather statistics, in particular daily or even sub-daily variability. One variant of these models are advanced stochastic perfect-prognosis methods, conditioned on large-scale atmospheric predictors on a&#160;daily basis, for instance multisite generalized linear models (Chandler, 2020). Another widely used variant is change-factor weather generators: the weather generator parameters are calibrated against present and future climate model simulations, and the climate change signals are then applied to the parameters calibrated to observations. Recent research has mainly focussed on multi-site Richardson type (Markov-chain) weather generators (Keller et&#160;al., 2015; Dubrovsky et&#160;al., 2019), some explicitly modelling extremes and their spatial dependence (Evin et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="475.88" top="150.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.77; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="315.21" y0="150.6" x1="475.88">10.3.1.3.5 Hybrid approaches and emulators</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="126.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A wide variety of approaches has been proposed to combine the advantages of different statistical approaches.
