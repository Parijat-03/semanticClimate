<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV)  « WGI »</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><h5 class="fs-6 text-primary p-2">AR6 <button data-report="AR6" data-phraseid="5487" class="specificlink btn btn-sm bg-primary text-light" title="More information/Translation"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></button></h5><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Large-scale fluctuations observed from one decade to the next in a variety of instrumental records and <em>proxy</em> reconstructions over the entire North Atlantic ocean and surrounding continents. Fingerprints of AMV can be found at the surface ocean, which is characterized by swings in basin-scale <em>sea surface temperature</em> anomalies reflecting the interaction with the <em>atmosphere</em>. The positive phase of the AMV is characterized by anomalous warming over the entire North Atlantic, with the strongest amplitude in the subpolar gyre and along sea-ice margin zones in the Labrador Sea and Greenland/Barents Sea and in the subtropical North Atlantic basin to a lower extent. In the AR6 WGI report, the term AMV is preferred to Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) used in previous IPCC reports because there is no preferred time scale of decadal variability as the term oscillation would indirectly imply. See Section AIV.2.7 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></dd><div>
