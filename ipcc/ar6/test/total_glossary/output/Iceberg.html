Icebergs can also be classified by shape, most commonly being either tabular (steep sides and a flat top) or non-tabular (varying shapes, with domes and spires) (NOAA, 2021). In lakes, icebergs can originate by breaking off shelf ice, which forms through freezing of a lake surface.</p></div></dd><div>
