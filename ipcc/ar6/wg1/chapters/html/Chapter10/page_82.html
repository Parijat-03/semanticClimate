These dry biases are connected to a&#160;lower tropospheric circulation that is too weak (Sperber et&#160;al., 2013) and wet biases in the equatorial Indian Ocean (Bollasina and Ming, 2013).

The attribution to anthropogenic aerosols is supported in CMIP5 single-forcing experiments, including some testing the sensitivity to local and remote emissions (Guo et&#160;al., 2015, 2016; Shawki et&#160;al., 2018), comparing CMIP5 GCMs forced by both aerosol and GHG to GHG only (Salzmann et&#160;al., 2014) and reducing emissions to pre-industrial levels (Takahashi et&#160;al., 2018). The large spread between individual model realisations of comparable magnitude to the aerosol-induced signal suggested to Salzmann et&#160;al.
