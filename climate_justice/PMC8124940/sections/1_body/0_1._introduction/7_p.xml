<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our study of Delhi adds to analyses of climate justice in India in three main ways. First, by focusing on urban heat and greenspace, we consider how social vulnerability in urban landscapes is shaped in terms of both burdens and benefits. This expands existing studies by being attentive to the difference between relatively more and less urbanized areas, an aspect which becomes important in the case of Delhi which is located within India&#8217;s northern agricultural belt. Second, our study of Delhi complements studies which focus on the state level in India [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], or selected neighborhoods within the city [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An urban emphasis brings out the local complexities of exposure to heat while also considering the city&#8217;s entire administrative area. Finally, the climate justice literature on India has focused on adaptive planning for heat stress [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the need to include local constituencies in central government-led international negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our climate justice analysis of urban heat and greenspace in Delhi extends these studies by recognizing social vulnerabilities that become significant to building inclusive climate change policies and politics.</p>
