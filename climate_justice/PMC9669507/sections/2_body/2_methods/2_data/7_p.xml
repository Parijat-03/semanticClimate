<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Next, we used The New York Times API<sup><xref rid="fn5-14614448221135632" ref-type="fn">5</xref></sup> to collect online news
comments for all articles in our sample that are published on the New York Times
website. For the remaining news sources, we used a custom web scraper to scrape
the comments section of the Washington Post and FiveThirtyEight articles. A
total of 1851 comments were collected, 1239 comments from articles published in
The New York Times, 328 comments from articles published in the Washington Post,
and 284 comments from FiveThirtyEight. Since we were only interested in
understanding the direct public response to predictive information in these
articles, and not commenters&#8217; responses to each other&#8217;s comments, we excluded
comment replies (i.e. comments to other readers&#8217; comments) before conducting our
analysis. Out of the 1851 comments originally collected, only 885 direct
comments were left for analysis (603 comments from The New York Times, 165
comments from the Washington Post, and 117 comments from FiveThirtyEight). A
small subset of uninformative comments were further excluded from the analysis
because they were lacking clear relevance to the article (e.g. &#8220;Trends are your
friends&#8221;). In the end, the remaining comments did not exhibit the quality issues
sometimes observed in online news comments (<xref rid="bibr34-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Santana, 2014</xref>) but rather reflected an
overall courteous (i.e. not rude, obscene, or trolling) discourse.</p>
