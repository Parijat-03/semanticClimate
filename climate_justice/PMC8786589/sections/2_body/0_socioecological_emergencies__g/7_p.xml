Second, to emphasize the importance of global socioecological justice implications in the context of the EU bioeconomy policy, I review some of the more recent empirical findings that emphasize the socioecological costs and creation of green sacrifice zones associated with transition to green and renewable resources and energy systems. Third, I outline the theory that informs this research&#8212;decoloniality, decolonial environmental justice and degrowth&#8212;followed by main results, consisting of dominant and alternative logics and approaches that act as barriers to vis-&#224;-vis enablers of just transformations. Finally, I reflect on the politics and the process of transformations and change.</p>
