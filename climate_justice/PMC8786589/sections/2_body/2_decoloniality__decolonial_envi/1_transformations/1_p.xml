Those include (1) reference to the Anthropocene and planetary boundaries (Gills and Morgan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>; Feola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2007</xref>) and (2) need for fundamental shift, as opposed to minor or incremental changes (Feola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>) and (3) radical and widespread societal changes as opposed to changes in a certain sector or policy domain (Holscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2018</xref>). Beyond these generic features, there is little agreement about what transformation is, what ends it should achieve, or how (Bluwstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>; Gram-Hanssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2021</xref>). The uncertainty about the <italic>what</italic> and the <italic>how</italic> of transformations, I argue, is part of the definition of transformations as an uncertain, emergent, heterogenic and multifaceted process which is not managed and instituted under the existing structures, forms of knowledge and definitions. This again sets transformations aside from the more structured and managed processes of transitions that are expected to lead societies towards known and desired ends and futures (Holscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2018</xref>; Pelenc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2019</xref>; Temper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>).</p>
