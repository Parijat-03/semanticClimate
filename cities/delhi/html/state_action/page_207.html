The contribution of agriculture in the State GDP is about 1%. The major challenge posed before the entire world today is the climate change or global warning. Several countries have initiated various measures to counter global warning. It has been estimated that due to continued human modification of the atmosphere the rate of future global warming over the period 1990-2100 would be about 0.20 degree celcius per decade, which stands some  five times the mean rate of warming over the past hundred years. During the early nineties, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had forecasted a worldwide negative impact of climate change on agriculture sector with less adverse effects on crop yields in mind and high latitude regions than such effects in low latitude regions. The warmer areas would witness decline in potential yields due shortening of crop growing period, decrease in water availability owing to higher rate of evapotranspiration, and poor vernalisation of temperate cereal crops. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="354.07" top="437.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="437.28" x1="354.07" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 437.28; y1: 449.28; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">16.1Current Status of Agriculture and Horticulture </span></div><div left="72.02" right="503.86" top="409.54"><span x0="72.02" y0="409.54" x1="503.86" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 409.54; y1: 421.54; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Delhi comes in northern plains of India.
