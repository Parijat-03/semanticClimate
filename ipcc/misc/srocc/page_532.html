(2015), there are a&#160;range of adaptation measures that can be put in place to reduce the impact of climate-related production shortfalls. These include (i) ensuring transparency of public and private stocks, as well as improved seasonal forecasting to signal forthcoming yield shortfalls (FAO 2016a; Ceglar et al. 2018; Iizumi et al. 2018), (ii) building real or virtual stockholdings, (iii) increasing local productivity and diversity (as a&#160;hedge against a&#160;reliance on trade) and (iv) ensuring smoother market responses, through, for example, avoiding the imposition of export bans.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.71" top="615.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 615.54; y1: 625.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="615.54" x1="307.71">In summary, given the likelihood that extreme weather will increase, in both frequency and magnitude (Hansen et al. 2012; Coumou et al. 2014; Mann et al. 2017; Bailey et al. 2015), and the current state of global and cross-sectoral interconnectedness, the food system is at increasing risk of disruption (</span><span style="x0: 163.75; x1: 170.61; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="163.75" y0="567.54" x1="300.72">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 300.72; x1: 303.36; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="300.72" y0="567.54" x1="307.57">), with large uncertainty about how this could manifest.
