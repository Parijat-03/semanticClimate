Agroecology fundamentally aims to promote the deep ecological, social, and economic knowledge of Indigenous Peoples, peasants, fisherfolk, and other small-scale food producers and custodians of land and water. It puts decision making power back in the hands of Indigenous Peoples and peasants and local communities. If the organizers of the UNFSS were genuine in their claim to a &#8216;People&#8217;s Summit&#8217;, the People would have turned up. Instead, you&#8217;ll find us organizing and participating in the People&#8217;s Autonomous Response to the UN Food Systems Summit.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref></p>
