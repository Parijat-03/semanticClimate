The contours of this transition have been rendered further uncertain by the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global oil market crash in the first half of 2020. While the technical issues of these transitions are well-researched <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the social aspects of the energy transition remain both emergent and essential to a successful outcome. Communities are being impacted in different ways. Positive impacts include reductions in air pollution and new tax revenues from renewables. However, negative impacts can include lost jobs and tax revenues after closure of large fossil fuel generation facilities and coal mines as well as strains on public revenue associated with mine reclamation efforts. While economic and social issues can be addressed through thoughtful policy design, the pace of change, and the extent to which communities have a say in what comes next, matter.</p><p id="p0010">In the United States, the Obama Administration addressed the issue of potential job and revenue losses in its&#x000a0;POWER&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Plan several years ago. A 2019 Bill in Colorado, HB19-1314, created a new institution called the &#x0201c;Just Transition Office&#x0201d; within the Department of Labor and Employment. While its focus is in coal plant and mine closures, the institutional framework could be applied in the future to other aspects of the energy transition <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Present challenges including the 2020 oil crash and the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated job losses in other parts of the energy sector, especially in oil and gas <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Whether these will remain permanent features of the energy landscape is not clear, but some level of consolidation and job loss was occurring prior to the virus&#x02019; spread <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The need for a &#x0201c;just transition,&#x0201d; a managed shift toward a low-carbon energy system that prioritizes secure, family-sustaining jobs and healthy communities, is urgent given emergent risk multipliers for those on the front lines of a shifting energy and labor landscape. We consider the roots of the notion of just transitions as they grew out of labor and environmental justice movements and examine existing institutions, processes, and policy initiatives that presently support the implementation of a just transition.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Roots</title><p id="p0015">Labor and environmental justice organizations have already provided many tools and theories, examined below, that can be applied to ensure that the current energy transition is equitable. To better understand these tools and theories, however, it is necessary to consider the origins of just transition frameworks. The concept of a just transition originated with the U.S. labor movement of the 1970&#x000a0;s and broadened as labor organizations forged alliances with environmental justice groups starting in the 1990&#x000a0;s. Initially the concept emerged in response to increased regulation of pollutive industries in the wake of the National Environmental Policy Act and the establishment of federal Superfund law in the U.S. Labor unions like the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers (OCAW), long vocal about the environmental impacts of their work, faced widespread job losses despite heavily funded cleanup efforts at contaminated work sites. Led by OCAW and others, workers demanded a &#x0201c;superfund for workers&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;superfund for communities&#x0201d; that included not only worker retraining and community support, but also broader efforts to plan and design a more environmentally-friendly approach to industrial production <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Current labor organizations in the U.S. that advocate for just transition frameworks include the BlueGreen Alliance, the Labor Network for Sustainability, and the Just Transition Alliance.</p><p id="p0020">Just transition frameworks have been integrated into political discourse in the European Union since at least the early 2000&#x000a0;s, arguably mirroring the belated focus on environmental justice concerns at the policy level relative to the United States. The notion of environmental justice originated in the U.S. in the mid-1980&#x000a0;s within the context of a broader movement for racial equality and increasing recognition that low-income communities and communities of color were disproportionately impacted by toxic waste dumping and industrial siting. However, environmental justice didn&#x02019;t enter into meaningful policy discussions in the EU until the early 2000&#x000a0;s <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Global labor organizations in the EU, on the other hand, have been advocating for just transition principles, initially under alternative designations like sustainable development and &#x02018;green jobs,&#x02019; since the late 1990&#x000a0;s. Organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) have long been involved in global environmental negotiations and have become leaders on advocacy for a range of objectives in support of a just transition <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">In recent years, energy transition research in the U.S. and globally has expanded to explore a range of economic and policy mechanisms necessary to achieve a just transition. Some have suggested that fossil fuel divestment presents a viable way to center issues of energy justice upstream, prompting the consideration of injustices related to supply-side analysis and decision-making in various energy sectors <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Just transition frameworks have been explored through the lens of political economy, advancing the notion that beyond worker protections, addressing energy access and poverty and adopting climate justice goals are necessary to ensure transition is equitable <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Just transition frameworks have also been leveraged to argue for the need for a socially equitable approach to sustainable design in a post-carbon future <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Likewise, there have been efforts to map and align environmental policy goals with anticipated levels of investment in renewables in conjunction with the implementation of adequate worker support systems and recommended public policy <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Energy Research and Social Scienc</italic>e has had numerous articles touching on various aspects of a just energy transition. Tvinnereim et al. (2017) look at the issues from a national perspective in Norway, while Biresselioglu et al. (2020) consider the wider European issues for individuals and collectives <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Johnstone et al. (2020) explore some of the non-technical issues of energy transitions <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Crowe and Li (2020) explore the issues of just transitions in certain US states for both coal and solar <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Sovacool and Brisbois (2019) explore the role of &#x0201c;elite power&#x0201d; in these transitions, while Schwarz (2020) considered the role of citizen power as did Thombs (2019) <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Both Bayulgen (2020) and Seidl (2019) looked as socio-economic aspects of specific energy transitions <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Prinz and Pegels (2018) considered the role of labor organizations in energy transitions, and Oselik (2019) used an advocacy coalition framework <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Li and Strachan (2019) used socio-economic modelling to explore transitions, and Hess (2019) viewed the issues through a local democracy lens <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">Within environmental justice research and especially advocacy circles, the concept of a just transition is viewed more expansively to include not only concerns about energy and jobs, but also of sustainability and equity. In this context, just transition frameworks encompass a range of issues like food justice, green gentrification, and energy sovereignty <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Organizations in the United States like the Just Transition Alliance (JTA) define a just transition that emphasizes the co-existence of a healthy environment and a strong economy, and that processes and practices necessary to achieve these goals should be inclusive, equitable, and community-driven. The JTA emerged in the mid-1990s out of a formalized Campaign for a Just Transition led by a coalition of labor and environmental justice groups, many rooted in low-income communities and communities of color in opposition to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was viewed as weak on environmental and labor protections <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The JTA has long prioritized issues beyond the workplace to include the regulation of chemical use in manufacturing, workplace safety best practices, expanded job opportunities and the development of innovative income and taxation structures in communities impacted by the closure of pollutive industries, public health advocacy, and more. The JTA has also supported labour-friendly climate policies nationally and internationally and argued for the incorporation of just transition language into global environmental discourse.</p><p id="p0035">The Climate Just Alliance (CJA) takes a more social justice-centric approach to just transition principles, emphasizing the importance of countering structural inequalities. The CJA defines a just transition as set of principles &#x0201c;that build economic and political power to shift from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy.&#x0201d; Key to these processes is an emphasis on &#x0201c;redressing past harms and creating new relationships of power for the future through reparations&#x0201d; <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this framework, policy paths necessary to ensure an equitable transition are highly contingent on geographical and cultural context and require community buy-in, agency, and empowerment. CJA membership includes a diverse range of organizations, from the Energy Justice Network and the Alliance for Appalachia to the Indigenous Environmental Network and the National Family Farm Coalition. The group outlines eight just transition principles, that emphasize that a just transition &#x0201c;must actively work against and transform historic social inequities based on race, class, gender, immigrant status, and other forms of oppression&#x0201d; <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The CJA cites these efforts as critical for working toward a just transition across diverse geographies in the United States and beyond, from communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction to those on the frontlines of climate change.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>A global response</title><p id="p0040">Just transition principles have been increasingly integrated into national and international policy reports and agreements, offering reason for optimism about near-future implementation. In 2015, the ITUC put out a document on climate justice related to changing jobs under a shift to a low-carbon economy <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;20) included just transition language in a resulting political outcome document &#x0201c;The Future We Want&#x0201d; <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

Although locally driven initiatives are emerging as preferred practices, sufficient revenues typically are not available within the local rural economies most impacted by pending loss of extractive industry.

Fixed timelines also give workers abilities to plan for their future and avoid the severe economic repercussions of sudden mass layoffs.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0120">While the just transition concept has gained significant traction in economic and policy circles, considerable challenges exist with regards to implementation. Obvious obstacles include the shifting and contingent dynamics of energy transitions across disparate geographical, political, and economic localities. The fact that there is no universally agreed-upon definition of or framework for just transitions presents further challenges. While in labor circles the notion of a just transition evokes solutions such as worker retraining, targeted economic development plans, and public and private investment, environmental and climate justice organizations approach just transitions more holistically and tend to emphasize support for community-level engagement and participatory governance. While there is significant overlap amongst these organizations regarding issues like sustainability and green jobs, achieving alignment and compromise will remain a necessary and ongoing task. Regional idiosyncrasies prevent further challenges. For example, solar is likely better suited than wind to replace local coal mining jobs but is not available or viable everywhere <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As such, it is critically important to document processes, policies, and outcomes within and across organizations that have adopted just transition principles. Coalition-building and information-sharing will be critical to compare results and leverage resources locally, nationally, and globally. Likewise, as evidenced by existing just transition initiatives, community-centric, co-productive approaches to policy design and implementation in regions most impacted by the energy transition must be emphasized in tandem with other government and industry stakeholder needs.</p><p id="p0125">Recent ongoing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the global oil crash both underscore the urgency of adopting and implementing just transition policies. Reduced demand for electricity has had an acute impact on coal, with analysts predicting the industry, unable to compete with cheaper renewables, will likely not recover post-pandemic <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. As a result, the COVID-19 crisis represents a unique opportunity to adopt just transition principles into community and economic recovery efforts. To be sure, challenges exist. For example, the pandemic has resulted in the loss of over half a million clean energy jobs, halting momentum in sectors like solar and wind <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. While the International Energy Agency has predicted a recovery in renewables following the early stages of the pandemic, uncertainty remains <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, there is tremendous upside in incorporating just transition policies into recovery efforts at the state and federal levels. In the U.S., massive stimulus bills such as the CARES Act represent an opportunity for parallel investments in clean energy and green jobs programs to support a just recovery and bolster economic and social resilience. Possible measures include targeted support for renewable energy projects, weatherization programs, building retrofits, electric vehicle manufacturing, and green job creation <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The potential for combining energy transition and recovery initiatives is likewise accompanied by the usual caveats with regard to funding needs, program implementation, and community participation. However, because just transition frameworks emerged out of diverse organizational coalitions and have evolved over the last few decades to respond to shifting social, environmental, and energy realities, they remain essential for supporting a shift to a low-carbon energy system that prioritizes sustainability and social and economic equity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0130">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="h0005">See e.g., A.
