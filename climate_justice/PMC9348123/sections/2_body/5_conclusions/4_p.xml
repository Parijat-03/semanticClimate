For example, In the children's networks, while group 1 tends to communicate with others within the group, group 2 and group 3 actively communicate with other groups. In the teens' networks, people belong to small groups, and barely communicate with others across the groups. In the adults' networks, group 1 and group 2 actively communicate with other groups.
