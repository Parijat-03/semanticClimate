      <td>In Central Asia, water scarcity has been ranked in the top five global risks (Gleick, 1993; Zhupankhan et al., 2018). Cross-boundary\nadaptation remains critically important in this region with abundant glaciers in the Pamir Plateau of Tajikistan (Hu et al., 2017) and areas\nwith severe glacier retreat in the Tianshan Mountains (Liu and Liu, 2015). The spatial variations of glacier and other climate variables\nhave added to uncertainty related to the dynamic of the water cycle. The headwater regions, such as Pamir area, would be significantly\naffected by the climate parameters, such as the stronger rainfall intensity, more frequent rainfall and higher temperature (Luo et al.,\n2019). The water resources in the Pamir Plateau will range from &#8722;0.48 to 5.6% (Gulakhmadov et al., 2020), and the crop phenological\nperiod in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will be about 1&#8211;2 weeks earlier. The threat of agricultural water stress is increasing as well. The oasis in\ndownstream areas will face more complex water resource fluctuations, water crisis and desertification. In particular, rain-fed agriculture in\nnorthern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and western Turkmenistan is particularly dependent on water resources. Under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5\nscenarios, considering CO fertilisation effects and land-use projections, the increase in CO atmospheric concentration and accumulated\n2 2\ntemperature can contribute to a 23% increase in cotton yield in Central Asia (Tian and Zhang, 2019), but extreme climate, such as\ndrought, heatwaves and rainstorms, will have a 10% negative impact on agricultural production and the ecological environment (Zhang\nand Ren, 2017). High-efficiency water-saving technology will help the upstream and downstream water resource management in Central\nAsian countries to adapt to the variation in water resources quantity, frequency and spatial pattern.</td>
