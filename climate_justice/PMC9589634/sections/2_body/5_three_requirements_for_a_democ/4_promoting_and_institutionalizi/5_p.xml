While mini-publics offer no substitute to these representative institutions and should not be empowered to take decisions, they can still fulfill important functions for public discourses in a deliberative system. Lafont distinguishes between contestatory, vigilant and anticipatory functions (Lafont <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>, ch. 5.2). Anticipatory uses are important where the public has not yet formed opinions on important matters and depends on a variety of sources of arguments and perspectives to develop such. Contestatory uses apply where arguments of democratic minorities are inadequately heard and considered in public opinion and policy-making. Vigilant uses, finally, are important where public opinion and policy-making are in discord.</p>
