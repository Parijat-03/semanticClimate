Lockdowns, travel bans, loss of employment, and physical distancing measures particularly exacerbated the vulnerabilities of poor people. Overcrowded living conditions, precarious and often informal employment, and the absence of disposable income made many of the sanitary and protective measures recommended to fight the spread of COVID-19 difficult to implement in practice.
