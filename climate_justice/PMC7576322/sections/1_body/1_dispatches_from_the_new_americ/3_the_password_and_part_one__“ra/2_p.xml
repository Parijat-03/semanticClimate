<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0035">The beginning of the book opens with Rush recounting her first trip to the tidal marshes of Jacob&#8217;s Point in Rhode Island, where she first encounters dead Tupelos, a type of tree that grew in the marsh. These Tupelos were poisoned by the slow creep of saltwater from the ocean making its way into the marsh, turning these once thriving trees into rampikes, a tree that has died due to saline inundation. Rush sees the rampikes (in Jacobs Point and beyond) to serve as the first of many signals that climate change is here, writing &#8220;I&#8217;ve encountered so many of these rampikes that I have come to think of them as a series of memorials&#8230; Together they commemorate the tipping point: the moment the salt water began to move in&#8221; (p. 47&#8211;48). Beyond Rush&#8217;s own account, other first person accounts in this chapter include the words of Laura Sewall, a resident in Maine who&#8217;s home overlooks a tidal marsh and who has witnessed changes in the environment of the marsh in her time living there, and Dan Kipnis, a Miami Beach resident who shares the story of how his family&#8217;s house has become ruined by sea-level rise.</p>
