<p>Here we offer some examples of how we apply these methodologies in the classroom. For
example, social work students in one community development course at The University of
Queensland use political storytelling drawing on &#8216;Poverty finds a Voice&#8217;, which
is a woman&#8217;s participatory theatre project in Melbourne in Australia (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Landvogt, 2012</xref>). The story is about a group of women who
perform a series of plays to an audience of bankers and policy makers about living on low
incomes, and of &#8216;not having enough money to live with dignity&#8217; (p. 55). The story
draws on Paulo <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Freire&#8217;s critical pedagogy
(1972)</xref> and Augusto <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Boal&#8217;s Theatre of the
Oppressed (1979)</xref> to identify and collectively analyse how change to transform
relationships of power and oppression can occur. In a group presentation assignment, one social
work student group brought this story to life. They engaged the class in an outdoor
&#8216;theatre&#8217; experience drawing on some of their own experiences of financial
struggle in their performance inviting class participation as &#8216;spect-actors&#8217; to
engage in a critical and collaborative problem-solving process.</p>
