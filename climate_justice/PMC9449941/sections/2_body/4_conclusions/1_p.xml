The accuracy match between policy package measurement details and consideration of exactly these specifications within the impact studies is difficult to reach. Thus, it was not always clear whether the impact studies adequately relied on the specific measurement configuration when carrying out their impact assessment. The inadequacy may be a result of insufficient consideration when designing the impact studies or a result of difficulties in translating the measurement details into the methods used (survey, simulation, etc.). Another shortcoming is the (non-)comparability or (in)commensurability of the single results. The heterogeneity of single results provision is an added-value for providing insights into real-world impact complexities, but simultaneously these are difficult to put into a coherent synthesis. Which results are more explanatory? Which are less relevant? This is difficult to assess. However, what still remains is the fact that integrated science approaches for policy advice seem to be the road to follow. Even if this road is a challenging one, the added-value of integrated approaches is early consideration of real-world complexities, uncertainties, and ambiguities. It will be worthwhile to spend future effort in trying to achieve solid and feasible concepts and practices.</p>
