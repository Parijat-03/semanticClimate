Historic emissions consider aggregate emissions over the whole period back to 1995, but not including the high-emissions period up to 1990. Benefits received are derived from capital stock available in 1995 (i.e., after economic restructuring), and are evaluated using a recent average EU emission intensity (and not the historical&#8212;and more emission intensive&#8212;levels from the years before 1990).</p>
