<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0305">Up to January 2021, the economies' transition in the post-COVID-19 era remains uncertain as the pandemic has not been controlled yet. By the end of the autumn of 2020, the so-called 2nd pandemic wave has reached most countries, causing a new cycle of horizontal lockdowns. Given the present uncertainties in distribution, acceptance, and efficiency of COVID-19 vaccination programs, the pandemic might continue up to the end of 2021, and a 3rd wave cannot be ruled out. Subsequently, the resilience of our food, energy, and material supply systems is at stake, and mitigation measures are widely debated. The experiences obtained from the previous &#8220;<italic>Black Swan</italic>&#8221; events of the last two centuries (e.g., the Spanish Flu of 1918&#8211;1920, and World War II) indicate that the societies resolve respective consequences with enormous creativity, adaptation to innovative pathways, and massive changes to tackle austerity (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Rowan and Galanakis, 2020</xref>). The crisis had occurred when the flaws of the current systems of production, transformation, and consumption were already evident (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Gerten et al., 2020</xref>). The exceptional measures taken to recover our economies from the crisis can be turned into opportunities for &#8216;building back better&#8217; and fostering the transition to a new economic system (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2021</xref>). The pandemic has revealed the need to redesign the global systems to minimize their vulnerability and build on local self-sufficiency. This is vital to prepare for future crises in flows of food, energy, and other goods, and above all, place citizens' wellbeing and the planet at its heart (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2020a</xref>).</p>
