Making such roles explicit in an adequate model that takes the complexities of multiple different levels and interactions into account is a significant new and challenging research field in sustainability science. In this article, we presented a heterarchic model that deals with norms in the sustainability discourse relying on a comparative analysis of the Pope&#8217;s Encyclical <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic>, the <italic>Sustainable Development Goals</italic> and the <italic>Paris Agreement.</italic> We argue that, understanding the complexity of normativity in scientific and non-scientific documents dealing with sustainability through our heterarchic model can help the sustainability community deal systematically with normative issues and dimensions in this field.</p>
