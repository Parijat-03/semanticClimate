## What we did

### Hack Session 01
- The group used the [summarizer Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/Summarization/summarization.ipynb) to summarize paragraphs from the IPCC reports or any paragraph of their choosing.

### Hack Session 02
the group discussed issues related to running the notebook which are mentioned in the [final presentation](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/climate-knowledge-hunt-hackathon-material/Group_2/Group2_hackthon.pptx)
- Accordingly, the group together wrote few lines of [code](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/climate-knowledge-hunt-hackathon-material/Group_2/hackathon_code_group2.py) to overcome issues stated in the presentation.

### What next?
Changes to the notebook will be made as we work to solve issues currently present and issues which may arrive in the future.
