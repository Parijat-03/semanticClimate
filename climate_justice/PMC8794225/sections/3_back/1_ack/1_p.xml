I am also thankful to Kim Niewolny for support for this project and for inviting me to participate in the Center for Food Systems and Community Transformation speaker series, to Scott Peters for encouragement and suggestions, to Ric MacDowell for sharing wisdom and experience, and to Judson Abraham and Bailey Villareal for their assistance. The essay also benefitted from generous feedback from three anonymous reviewers.&#160;I take responsibility for errors and omissions.</p>
