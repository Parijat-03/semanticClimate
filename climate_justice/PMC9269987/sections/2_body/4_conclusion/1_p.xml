In our study, guilt mediated the relationship between justice sensitivity and pro-environmental intention. Authentic pride was also found to be a significant predictor of pro-environmental intention. Moral disengagement in high carbon behavior turned out to be a barrier to pro-environmental behavior change and is associated with dispositional victim sensitivity.</p>
