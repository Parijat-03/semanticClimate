<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0015">West Nile Virus (WNV) has recently emerged as a major public health concern in Europe, its recent expansion also coincided with some remarkable socio-economic and environmental changes, including an economic crisis and some of the warmest temperatures on record. To date, there has been very little research investigating this phenomenon at a European wide scale and more work is required to reveal the key drivers of the disease. A better understanding of this phenomenon can help public health officials design health prevention measures and develop better predictive models for public health risk management. More specifically, little work has been done to explore the association between the rise of WNV in Europe and the economic crisis unfolding from 2008 on-wards. Although the study of physical factors is key in understanding disease transmission and distribution, few articles have considered links among societal factors, like changes in the economy and in policy making <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which we know can have wide and unintended effects on natural ecosystems and, eventually, on disease <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although examining such factors presents certain challenges and uncertainties, given the scales involved and lack of data, the continuation of abrupt socio-economic changes (brought by the COVID-19 pandemic) and climate change impacts indicate an urgent need to examine such statistical relationships more closely, at the very least to open up scholarly debate and instigate further research on the topic.</p>
