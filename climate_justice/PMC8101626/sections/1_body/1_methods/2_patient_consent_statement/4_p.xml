Each line abutting the periphery of the circle (nodes) represents a unique user, and lines connecting users (edges) signify a retweet. Similarly, darker or thicker lines represent increased numbers of retweets. We set the minimum number of retweet mentions at 75 and label the ensuing top 18 users based on the number of retweet mentions, with label font size being proportional to number of nodes.</p>
