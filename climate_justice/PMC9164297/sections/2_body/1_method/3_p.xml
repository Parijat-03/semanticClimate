<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">We reviewed articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and books on the co-production of knowledge for adaptation that treated adaptation as an SDG target and/or discussed adaptation in relation to the SDGs. We did not include review articles. The selection was limited to articles published after the SDG agenda was implemented, targeting findings from post-SDG processes. This meant that the cut-off date for literature was 01.01.2016. Our selection included 52 publications. Of these, six were derived from a search by citation in the Scopus and Web of Science databases using this search string: &#8220;Adaptation,&#8221; &#8220;participation,&#8221; and &#8220;sustainability.&#8221; A search that consisted of &#8220;Adaptation,&#8221; &#8220;co-production,&#8221; and &#8220;SDG&#8221; yielded only two articles. We therefore conducted a search in Google Scholar, using the search string &#8220;SDG,&#8221; &#8220;co-production,&#8221; and &#8220;climate change adaptation.&#8221; This gave 280 hits. Of these, 44 were selected based on title, publication type (only peer-reviewed journal articles, book sections, and books were to be included), and review of abstracts. As Google Scholar search also yields results based on the occurrence of search words in the full text, an abstract review is necessary to assess whether the different documents that appear in the search are within the scope of the literature for the review. The most frequent reason for excluding documents was that they did not cover all three topics of co-production, SDGs, and adaptation.
