Whitehead (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0293" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) distinguishes parallels between climate adaptation agendas and neoliberal interests, in terms of efforts to protect and build (global) capital investment and means of production. Hodson and Marvin (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0150" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) demonstrate how economic stakeholders dominated the formulation of a low&#8208;carbon vision for Greater Manchester, which perpetuated the focus on economic growth rather than opening up for socio&#8208;environmental change. Ahmed, Nahiduzzaman, and Hasan (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) argues that adaptation planning in Asian and African cities is based on neoliberal fantasies of a Singaporean development model that ignore the realities of most urban inhabitants.</p>
