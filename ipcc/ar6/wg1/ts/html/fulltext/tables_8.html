      <td>(Climate change) risk: The concept of risk is a key aspect of how the IPCC assesses and communicates to decision-makers about the\npotential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognizing the diversity of values and objectives associated with\nsuch systems. In the context of climate change, risks can arise from potential impacts of climate change as well as human responses to\nclimate change. WGI contributes to the common IPCC risk framing through the assessment of relevant climate information, including\nclimatic impact-drivers and low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes.

      <td>Climatic impact-drivers: Physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that can be directly connected with\nhaving impacts on human or ecological systems are described as &#8216;climatic impact-drivers&#8217; (CIDs) without anticipating whether their\nimpacts are detrimental (i.e., as for hazards in the context of climate change risks) or provide potential opportunities. A range of indices\nmay capture the sector- or application-relevant characteristics of a climatic impact-driver and can reflect exceedances of identified\ntolerance thresholds.

Physical climate storylines are introduced in AR6 to explore uncertainties in climate change and natural climate variability, to\ndevelop and communicate integrated and context-relevant regional climate information, and to address issues with deep uncertainty7,\nincluding low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes.

To better inform risk assessment and\ndecision-making, such low-likelihood outcomes are considered if they are associated with very large consequences and may therefore\nconstitute material risks, even though those consequences do not necessarily represent the most likely outcome.
