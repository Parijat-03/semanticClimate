<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par31">Our counterfactual analysis for moderate to severe food insecurity (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; columns 2&#8211;3) shows that incidence of food insecurity would have been 47.65% in Africa (2.25 percentage-points lower) if the temperature followed the historical trajectory. The lowest change would have been in Europe, where food insecurity would have been 11.73% without climate change compared to 13.19% with climate change (1.46 percentage-points lower). For the case of severe food insecurity (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; columns 4&#8211;5), the cumulative effects of climate change are smaller but still non-negligible. In Africa, severe food insecurity would have been 21.8% if the temperature followed the historical trajectory (0.88 percentage-points lower) while the lowest estimated change would have again been in Europe, 1.86% compared to 2.05% (0.19 percentage-points). These differences in impacts are driven by the differentiated impacts of temperature anomaly on the two indicators of food insecurity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Counterfactual analysis: effects of climate change on food insecurity.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="5">Counterfactual analysis: effects of climate change on food insecurity</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Region</th><th align="left">Moderate to severe (historical)</th><th align="left">Counterfactual scenario</th><th align="left">Severe (historical)</th><th align="left">Counterfactual scenario</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Africa</td><td align="left">49.89%</td><td align="left">47.65%</td><td align="left">22.68%</td><td align="left">21.80%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Americas</td><td align="left">32.72%</td><td align="left">30.72%</td><td align="left">10.67%</td><td align="left">10.11%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Asia</td><td align="left">33.49%</td><td align="left">31.35%</td><td align="left">9.69%</td><td align="left">9.10%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Europe</td><td align="left">13.19%</td><td align="left">11.73%</td><td align="left">2.05%</td><td align="left">1.86%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
