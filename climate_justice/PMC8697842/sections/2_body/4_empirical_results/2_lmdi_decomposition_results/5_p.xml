In 15 of 27 periods, the carbon intensity raised the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the country. The periods where the carbon intensity reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were found to be 1992&#8211;1993, 1993&#8211;1994, 1995&#8211;1996, 1999&#8211;2000, 2002&#8211;2003, 2006&#8211;2007, 2007&#8211;2008, 2009&#8211;2010, 2010&#8211;2011, 2011&#8211;2012, 2012&#8211;2013, and 2013&#8211;2014. Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased by 49.8% from 278,424.4 to 417,041.3 ktons between 1990 and 2017 (UNFCCC, 2020). Over the same period, the non-renewable energy consumption increased by 42.5% (IEA, 2020). Therefore, the carbon intensity effect increased Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by an average of 603.6 ktons on annual basis according to LMDI computations. The cumulative impact of the carbon intensity effect on the country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was calculated as 16,295.9 ktons for 2017. In the same year, the cumulative share of the carbon intensity effect was found to be 11.8% using the LMDI approach.</p>
