      <td>thereby offsetting the expected strengthening of monsoon precipitation in response to GHG-induced warming (Box TS.13, Figure 1).\nMultiple lines of evidence explain this contrast over South Asia, with the observed trends dominated by the effects of aerosols, while\nfuture projections are mostly driven by GHG increases. The recent partial recovery and enhanced intensity of monsoon precipitation\nover West Africa is related to the growing influence of GHGs with an additional contribution due to the reduced cooling effect of\nanthropogenic aerosols, emitted largely from North America and Europe (medium confidence). For other regional monsoons, that\nis, North and South America and Australia, there is low confidence in the attribution of recent changes in precipitation (Box TS.13,\nFigure 1) and winds. {2.3.1, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, Box 8.1, 10.6.3}</td>

      <td>Projections of regional monsoons during the 21st century indicate contrasting (region-dependent) and uncertain precipitation and\ncirculation changes. The annual contrast between the wettest and driest month of the year is likely to increase by 3&#8211;5% per degree\nCelsius in most monsoon regions in terms of precipitation, precipitation minus evaporation, and runoff (medium confidence). For the\nNorth American monsoon, projections indicate a decrease in precipitation, whereas increased monsoon rainfall is projected over South\nand South East Asia and over East Asia (medium confidence) (Box TS.13, Figure 1). West African monsoon precipitation is projected\nto increase over the central Sahel and decrease over the far western Sahel (medium confidence). There is low confidence in projected\nprecipitation changes in the South American and Australian-Maritime Continent regional monsoons (for both magnitude and sign)\n(Box TS.13, Figure 1). There is medium confidence that the monsoon season will be delayed in the Sahel and high confidence that it\nwill be delayed in North and South America. {8.2.2, 8.4.2.4, Box 8.2}</td>

At both global and regional scales, there is medium confidence that internal variability contributes the largest\nuncertainty related to projected changes, at least in the near term (2021&#8211;2040). A collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation could weaken the African and Asian monsoons but strengthen the Southern Hemisphere monsoons (high confidence).\n{4.4.4, 4.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.1, 9.2.3, 10.6.3}</td>
