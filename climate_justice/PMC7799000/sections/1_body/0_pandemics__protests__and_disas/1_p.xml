<bold>A<sc>Nna</sc> N. D<sc>Hody</sc>:</bold> I am the acting codirector and curator of the M&#252;tter Museum and the director of the M&#252;tter Research Institute. The M&#252;tter Museum is part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, a professional society founded in 1787 and a museum that opened in 1863. It is primarily a medical history museum, but the core of its collection is biological specimens that directly reflect nineteenth-century public health concerns, many of which, of course, were latent infectious diseases&#8212;pandemics. The specimens were primarily donated to us by the physicians who were members. The museum is still active. It still collects.</p>
