To reduce these, as an initial step, national governments should sign the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action, which commits states to &#8220;scale up efforts to respect, promote and consider the rights of children and young people in implementation of the Paris Agreement at all levels.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> The intergovernmental declaration also reinforces commitments that policies and decisions be taken in the best interest of future generations.<sup><xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> This would discourage policy makers and financial institutions from using high social discount rates in policy and investment assessments and from focusing solely on short-term economic returns. Such a commitment would incentivize states to meet their human rights obligations to children under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and demonstrate willingness to expand their duties to young people over the age of 18.</p>
