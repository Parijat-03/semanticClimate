Yet, we seldom see any serious and significant engagement with this set of literature in the rapidly expanding research on the politics of climate change, even those subsets of the latter that directly relate to the issue of land. One outcome of this is that the climate change scholarship misses some of the enduring puzzles and questions in relation to the politics of land control that should be made front and centre of any land-based mitigation and adaptation actions. In this regard, we pointed out some of the contentious issues in the relationship between climate change and land.</p>
