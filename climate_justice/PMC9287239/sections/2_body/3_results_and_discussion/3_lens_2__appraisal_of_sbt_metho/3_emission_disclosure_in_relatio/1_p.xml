[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] both reported issues with insufficient corporate emission disclosure, which prevented them from tracking performance against 49% (no data for 34% and poor data quality for 15%) and 21%, respectively, of initially considered SBTs. These discard rates indicate a need for standardized corporate disclosure on target progress, including for scope 3 engagement targets. In addition, Dagnet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] noted that the flexible SBTi guidelines mean that corporate emissions are not necessarily reported in a format that governments can easily use to inform policymaking. These issues relate to broader criticism of the largely self-reported, unaudited, and unverified nature of corporate emission data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
