It is crucial to characterize and monitor drought and its propagation to minimize the impact. However, spatiotemporal assessment of drought characteristics over India at the sub-basin scale based on terrestrial water storage is unexplored. In this study, the Terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) obtained from a Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and precipitation data are used to characterize the propagation of drought. Combined Climatological Deviation Index (CCDI) and GRACE-Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI) were computed as CCDI utilizes both precipitation and TWSA data while GRACE-DSI uses only TWSA data. Our results showed that GRACE-DSI exhibits significant negative trends over most of the Indian sub-basins compared to CCDI, indicating that most of the drought events are due to depletion of TWS. While other sub-basins show changing trends for GRACE-DSI and CCDI. The number of sub-basins showing significant negative trends for GRACE-DSI is more than that for CCDI. Hence TWS is depleting for most of the subbasins in India. Our results show that Indo-Gangetic plains face many drought events during 2002-2004, 2009-2014 &amp; 2015-2017. Maximum drought duration and drought severity obtained for the area of North Ladakh (not draining into Indus basins) by GRACE-DSI are 26\u00a0months (2002-2004) and -\u200944.2835, respectively. The maximum drought duration and drought severity obtained for the Shyok sub-basin by CCDI is 17\u00a0months (2013-2015) and -\u200913.4392, respectively. Monthly trend analysis revealed that 39 &amp; 23 no. of sub-basins show significant negative GRACE-DSI trends for October and CCDI for November, respectively. At the same time, the seasonal trend shows that\u00a0total 34\u00a0and 14 sub-basins exhibited a significant negative trend at post-monsoon Kharif season for both the GRACE-DSI &amp; CCDI, respectively.", "affiliation": "Department of Hydrology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, 247667, India.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Water"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Climate"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Meteorology"}]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "Water", "registryNumber": "059QF0KO0R"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18511-2"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9474877"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9474877?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2022-09-16", "dateOfCreation": "2022-09-14", "firstIndexDate": "2022-09-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-09-17", "dateOfRevision": "2022-11-15", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-09-14", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-09-14"}
