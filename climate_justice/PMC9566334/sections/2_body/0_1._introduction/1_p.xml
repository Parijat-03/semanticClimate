Due to variations in the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, communities that have historically been marginalized are exposed to significantly higher SUHI temperatures than predominantly White communities within the same city. However, we lack a clear understanding of the temporal and spatial trends in heat exposure within these communities and cities. For example, are SUHI temperatures in predominantly Black communities increasing or decreasing through time? A strong contributor to these disparities is the effects of residential segregation and its influence on disparate thermal exposure. These effects need further quantification, especially longitudinally. Uncovering trends in inequitable exposure and validating the inequities through time and space will further efforts to combat environmental, social, and climatic injustice. Armed with these types of analyses policy-makers and community planners can focus on the most inequitably exposed members of urban populations.</p>
