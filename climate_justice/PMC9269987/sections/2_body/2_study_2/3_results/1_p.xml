Additionally, we investigated Hypothesis 3 which stated that there is an association between moral emotions and pro-environmental behavior and intention. All three hypotheses were tested by calculating multiple regression analyses on (a) pro-environmental intention and (b) pro-environmental behavior. The prerequisites of no autocorrelation and multicollinearity were given for both regression models on pro-environmental behavior and pro-environmental intention. Homoskedasticity was given for Model B (pro-environmental behavior), but not for Model A (pro-environmental intention), and normal distribution of residuals was not given in both models. As a regression analysis can be considered robust (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2013</xref>), it was nevertheless used in this study.</p>
