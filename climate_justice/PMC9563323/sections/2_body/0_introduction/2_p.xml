<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Single-use plastics account for roughly half of all plastics produced and thrown away (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">Geyer et&#160;al. 2017</xref>), and almost 70% of plastic waste is plastic packaging (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_096" ref-type="bibr">WRAP 2021b</xref>). It is estimated that there are currently around eight billion tons of plastic in the Earth&#8217;s system, and that roughly ten million tons end up in our oceans every year (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_086" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al. 2004</xref>). By 2050, it is projected that there will be as much as 40 billion tons of plastic in circulation on our planet (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">Geyer et&#160;al. 2017</xref>). While single-use plastic has enabled countless life-saving and life-aiding interventions, for humans in particular, it has simultaneously become enmeshed in a global pollution and consumption crisis that negatively affects all life on Earth. In this article, we report the process and outcome of an ecolinguistics-informed, corpus-assisted discourse analysis of the language of plastic packaging, disposal, and (re)use. This was conducted as part of <italic toggle="yes">Many Happy Returns</italic> (MHR), a large, multidisciplinary project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the aim of which is to develop reusable packaging systems in an effort to reduce reliance on single-use plastics in the UK.</p>
