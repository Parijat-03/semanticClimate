<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Greenspaces with their cooling benefits appear more frequently in high-income White neighborhoods in dry urban regions than in low-income or non-White neighborhoods [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Jenerette et al. [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found vegetation to be positively correlated with income in seven Southwestern U.S. metropolitan regions. Greenspaces are often absent or fragmented in low-income neighborhoods [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While finding White neighborhoods to have more tree canopy, other researchers determined that Latinx and African American neighborhoods have higher potential for tree canopy [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], indicating that the mitigation potential from tree canopy in Hispanic and African American neighborhoods exceeds that in White neighborhoods.</p>
