<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0455">The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a symptom of the growing pressure of human activities on natural systems and the disruptions caused by COVID-19 illustrate the multi-dimensional threat that pandemics can hold to sustainable development (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Di Marco et al., 2020</xref>). With land-use changes and consumption behavior being among major drivers of pandemic risks, food systems play a pivotal role in helping to integrate human and animal health and increasingly also broader environmental health perspectives, as demanded of the One Health concept (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Destoumieux-Garz&#243;n et al., 2018</xref>). While principles and operational guidance for implementing One Health are advancing (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Gruetzmacher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Berthe et al., 2018</xref>), a further broadening of linkages with ecological and environmental sciences is called for in guarding against zoonotic diseases but also other health risks (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Humboldt-Dachroeden et al., 2020</xref>). Given the central position that food systems already occupy in their (positive or negative) impacts on the earth's life support systems, the lessons from the pandemic should provide impetus to ensure that food system accounts for the interlinkages between human and environment interactions and comprehensive risk management approaches to limit the emergence of other similar and potentially more dangerous threats in the future are advanced.</p>
