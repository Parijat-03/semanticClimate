We received 28 responses, with respondents ranging from retailer and manufacturer representatives to business owners, packaging designers, and consultants, among others. The responses to the survey, though relatively small in size, were included in Corpus 1 along with the public guidance and the supermarket website texts. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_tab_001" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref> shows the final composition of Corpus 1.</p>
