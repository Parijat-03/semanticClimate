Such promotion is necessary if we are to meet the challenges climate change poses, for as science education scholars like Kagawa and Selby (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), Gonz&#225;lez&#8208;Gaudiano and Meira&#8208;Cartea (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), and Lotz&#8208;Sisitka (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) argue, scientific knowledge must be counterbalanced with active pedagogical attention to agency, ethics, and intervention.</p>
