Even though women's role in food security is more seriously recognized in development policy and practice over the recent years, women's voice in food security solutions are often ignored or left out (<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Karl, 2009</xref>). Women's participation in decision making in food security solutions needs to be actively promoted and strengthened, beyond instrumental participation. Women's concerns and needs should not only be guiding the development of food security solutions, but also their resilient and sustainable knowledge and practices. Food security solutions should be based on women's dual experience in food security: their experience as food producers and their experience as food providers of the household. Furthermore, food security solutions need to take into account the variety of experiences and needs of women as they are not a homogenous group, which is still often presumed in smallholders' development interventions (<xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Wangu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Ros-Tonen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#252;nenfelder and Schurr, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Beyene et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
