<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Following inclusion and exclusion criteria review, a multi-stage thematic analysis [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] of the 58 articles was undertaken in NVivo 12 (QSR International, Chadstone, Victoria, Australia) to capture important themes, terms, and quotes from the selected studies. Thematic analysis is an analysis methodology where researchers search for emerging themes in the data which aid in describing the phenomenon of focus and which become the categories of analysis [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This process further involves reading through the data, identifying key themes, revisiting the data, and refining themes as the researchers engage in coding. As such, first, the articles were read by co-authors A.M.K. and S.M.W. so they could develop familiarity with the data, reflect on initial trends and interpretations of the articles, and create an interim codebook which was then revised throughout the analysis and inductively compiled. The codes included climate change impacts on mental health for youth and children, their perceptions of climate change, importance of resilience building, proposed interventions, methodologies used, and related calls to action.</p>
