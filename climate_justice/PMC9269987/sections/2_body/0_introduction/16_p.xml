<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We also checked whether the three hypotheses also apply for pro-environmental behavior (H1b, H2b, and H3b). However, one must note that pro-environmental intentions might not be implemented in pro-environmental behavior and therefore may not account for all of the variance in pro-environmental behavior. This issue is known as the intention-behavior gap (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Sheeran, 2002</xref>). If the predictions of Hypotheses 1&#8211;3 apply for pro-environmental intention, they might not necessarily apply to pro-environmental behavior.</p>
