      <td>Reconciling the increasing global food demand with limited\nland resources and low environmental impact is a major\nglobal challenge (FAO 2018a; Godfray and Garnett 2014; Yao\net al. 2017). South America has been a significant contributor\nof the world&#8217;s agricultural production growth in the last three\ndecades (OECD and FAO 2015), driven partly by increased\nexport opportunities for specific commodities, mainly\nsoybeans and meat (poultry, beef and pork).</td>

The Amazon biome is a particularly\nsensitive biome as it provides crucial ecosystem services\nincluding biodiversity, hydrological processes (through\nevapotranspiration, cloud formation, and precipitation), and\nbiogeochemical cycles (including carbon) (Bogaerts et al.\n2017; Fearnside 2015; Beuchle et al. 2015; Grecchi et al. 2014;\nCelentano et al. 2017; Soares-Filho et al. 2014; Nogueira et al.\n2018). Further, deforestation associated with commodity\nexports has not led to inclusive socioeconomic development,\nbut rather has exacerbated social inequality and created\nmore challenging living conditions for lower-income people\n(Celentano et al. 2017). Nor has it avoided increased hunger</td>
