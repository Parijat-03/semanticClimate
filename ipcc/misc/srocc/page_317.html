Enabling policy responses for improvement of IWM performance include: a&#160;greater emphasis on ecological restoration rather than civil engineering; sharper focus on sustainability of livelihoods than just conservation; adoption of &#8216;water justice&#8217; as a&#160;normative goal and minimising externalities on non-stakeholder communities; rigorous independent biophysical monitoring, with feedback mechanisms and integration with larger schemes for food and ecological security, and maintenance of environmental &#64258;ows for downstream areas (Bharucha et al. 2014; Calder et al. 2008; Joy et al. 2006). Successful adaptation of IWM to achieve land degradation neutrality would largely depend on how IWM creatively engages with dynamics of large-scale land use and hydrology under a&#160;changing climate, involvement of livelihoods and rural incomes in ecological restoration, regulation of groundwater use, and changing aspirations of rural population (</span><span style="x0: 67.84; x1: 70.65; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="67.84" y0="495.55" x1="124.73">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 124.73; x1: 127.01; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="124.73" y0="495.55" x1="128.94">, </span><span style="x0: 129.03; x1: 133.6; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="129.03" y0="495.55" x1="185.92">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 185.92; x1: 188.56; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="185.92" y0="495.55" x1="313.24">) (O&#8217;Brien et al. 2004; Samuel et al. 2007; Samuel and Joy 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="182.09" top="459.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 459.42; y1: 469.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="459.42" x1="182.09">1.7.5.3 Limpopo River Basin</span></div><div left="65.2" right="187.58" top="435.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 435.52; y1: 445.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="435.52" x1="187.58">Covering an area of 412,938 km</span><span style="x0: 187.59; x1: 190.79; y0: 439.44; y1: 446.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="187.59" y0="439.44" x1="190.79">2</span><span style="x0: 190.79; x1: 193.07; y0: 435.52; y1: 445.02; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="190.79" y0="435.52" x1="313.22">, the Limpopo River basin spans parts of Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, eventually entering into the Mozambique Channel. It has been selected as a&#160;case study as it provides a&#160;clear illustration of the combined effect of deserti&#64257;cation and climate change, and why IWM may be a&#160;crucial component of reducing exposure to climate change. It is predominantly a&#160;semi-arid area with an average annual rainfall of 400 mm (Mosase and Ahiablame 2018). Rainfall is both highly seasonal and variable, with the prominent impact of the El Ni&#241;o/La Ni&#241;a phenomena and the Southern Oscillation leading to severe droughts (Jury 2016). It is also exposed to tropical cyclones that sweep in from the Mozambique Channel often leading to extensive casualties and the destruction of infrastructure (Christie and Hanlon 2001). Furthermore, there is good agreement across climate models that the region is going to become warmer and drier, with a&#160;change in the frequency of &#64258;oods and droughts (Engelbrecht et al. 2011; Zhu and Ringler 2012). Seasonality is predicted to increase, which in turn may increase the frequency of &#64258;ood events in an area that is already susceptible to &#64258;ooding (Spaliviero et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="195.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 195.55; y1: 205.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="195.55" x1="313.21">A clear need exists to both address exposure to &#64258;ood events as well as predicted decreases in water availability, which are already acute. Without the additional impact of climate change, the basin is rapidly reaching a&#160;point where all available water has been allocated to users (Kahinda et al. 2016; Zhu and Ringler 2012). The urgency of the situation was identi&#64257;ed several decades ago (FAO 2004), with the countries of the basin recognising that responses are required at several levels, both in terms of system governance and the need to address land degradation. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="75.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 75.57; y1: 85.07; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="75.57" x1="313.21">Recent reviews of the governance and implementation of IWM within the basin recognise that an integrated approach is needed </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.73" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.57" x1="571.73">and that a&#160;robust institutional, legal, political, operational, technical and support environment is crucial (Alba et al. 2016; Gbetibouo et al. 2010; Machethe et al. 2004; Spaliviero et al. 2011; van der Zaag and Savenije 1999). Within the scope of emerging lessons, two principal ones emerge. The &#64257;rst is capacity and resource constraints at most levels. Limited capacity within Limpopo Watercourse Commission (LIMCOM) and national water management authorities constrains the implementation of IWM planning processes (Kahinda et al. 2016; Spaliviero et al. 2011). Whereas strategy development is often relatively well-funded and resourced through donor funding, long-term implementation is often limited due to competing priorities. The second is adequate representation of all parties in the process in order to address existing inequalities and ensure full integration of water management. For example, within Mozambique, signi&#64257;cant strides have been made towards the decentralisation of river basin governance and IWM. Despite good progress, Alba et al. (2016) found that the newly implemented system may enforce existing inequalities as not all stakeholders, particularly smallholder farmers, are adequately represented in emerging water management structures and are often inhibited by &#64257;nancial and institutional constraints. Recognising economic and socio-political inequalities, and explicitly considering them to ensure the representation of all participants, can increase the chances of successful IWM implementation. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="557.81" top="423.01"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.96; y0: 423.01; y1: 435.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="423.01" x1="557.81">1.8 Knowledge gaps and key uncertainties</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="399.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 399.52; y1: 409.02; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="399.52" x1="571.74">&#8226; Deserti&#64257;cation has been studied for decades and different drivers of deserti&#64257;cation have been described, classi&#64257;ed, and are generally understood (e.g.,&#160;overgrazing by livestock or salinisation from inappropriate irrigation) (D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2013). However, there are knowledge gaps on the extent and severity of deserti&#64257;cation at global, regional, and local scales (Zhang and Huisingh 2018; Zucca et al. 2012). Overall, improved estimation and mapping of areas undergoing deserti&#64257;cation is needed. This requires a&#160;combination of rapidly expanding sources of remotely sensed data, ground observations and new modelling approaches. This is a&#160;critical gap, especially in the context of measuring progress towards achieving the Land Degradation Neutrality target by 2030 in the framework of SDGs.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.79" top="231.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="231.55" x1="571.79">&#8226; Despite numerous relevant studies, consistent indicators for attributing deserti&#64257;cation to climatic and/or human causes are still lacking due to methodological shortcomings.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="183.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 183.55; y1: 193.05; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="183.55" x1="571.76">&#8226; Climate change impacts on dust and sand storm activity remain a&#160;critical gap. In addition, the impacts of dust and sand storms on human welfare, ecosystems, crop productivity and animal health are not measured, particularly in the highly affected regions such as the Sahel, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Dust deposition on snow and ice has been found in many regions of the globe (e.g.,&#160;Painter et al. 2018; Kaspari et al. 2014; Qian et al. 2015; Painter et al. 2013), however, the quanti&#64257;cation of the effect globally, and estimation of future changes in the extent of this effect, remain knowledge gaps.</span></div></body></html>
