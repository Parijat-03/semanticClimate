The interviewees emphasized that they had met nice, open people in the initiatives, &#8220;with whom one could feel comfortable very quickly.&#8221; They liked being surrounded by <italic>like-minded people</italic> who shared similar views, with whom they could exchange ideas and by whom they felt inspired.
