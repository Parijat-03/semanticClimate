Symptoms can include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. In some cases, the infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. COVID&#8208;19 can be transmitted not only through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person, but also be infected from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face.<xref rid="hpm3500-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">
