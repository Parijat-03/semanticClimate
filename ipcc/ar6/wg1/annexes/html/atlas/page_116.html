The connection between precipitation, temperature, and deposited snow is 15 different for sea ice compared to snow over land. This is because sea ice usually provides a heat source to the 16 bottom of the snow cover, the sea-ice cover is not necessarily around for a long period, and sea-ice drift 17 actively transports snow over large distances. 18 19 Snow thickness observations on sea ice are sparse and no continuous dataset with a sufficient spatial 20 coverage exists. Existing sporadic data indicate regional differences with a negative trend in snow thickness 21 over the sea ice for the western Arctic, and a rather thick snow cover in the Atlantic sector (Section 2.3.2.1) 22 (Webster et al., 2014, 2018; R&#246;sel et al., 2018). Available observations from drifting buoys do not show 23 significant trends in snowfall rate (Webster et al., 2014). Changes in snow thickness on sea ice are therefore 24 primarily driven by changes in the prevailing sea-ice type and sea-ice age: multi-year ice (MYI), which is sea 25 ice that has survived a summer, will capture all snowfall throughout the entire annual cycle. On the other 26 hand, first-year ice (FYI, that only forms throughout autumn and winter) will not carry any of the snow that 27 fell before the ice formed. Hence, there is a clear connection between snow depth and ice type, with up to 28 double the snow depths on MYI compared with FYI (Kurtz and Farrell, 2011; Blanchard-Wrigglesworth et 29 al., 2015). To reflect this, snow climatologies used for the satellite inference of sea-ice thickness based on 30 altimeter measurements are usually corrected using a thinner snow thickness for FYI compared with MYI 31 (Laxon et al., 2013; Ricker et al., 2017). 32 33 34 </span><span style="x0: 56.71; x1: 63.41; y0: 340.67; y1: 351.65; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.71" y0="340.67" x1="244.77">Atlas.5.10.3.2 Key processes and impacts  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="340.67" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 340.67; y1: 351.65; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">35 Two processes are known to lead to sea-ice growth at the ice surface: snow-ice formation, which implies 36 freezing of a slush layer at the snow-sea ice interface after flooding by sea water, and superimposed ice 37 formation, freezing of a similar layer, but with the contribution of freshwater from rain or snow melt instead 38 of sea water (Onstott, 1992; Eicken, 1998). The snow cover in the Arctic Ocean has, in the past, generally 39 been too thin to load the ice to the point where negative freeboard occurs, and surface flooding can result in 40 snow-ice formation (Haapala et al., 2013; Granskog et al., 2017). However, thinning of the sea ice, as 41 observed in the Arctic (Section 2.3.2.1; SROCC 3.2.1.1.2), decreases the freeboard, unless the snow cover in 42 parallel also becomes substantially less. Hence, snow-ice formation is expected to increase in the Arctic in 43 the future (Merkouriadi et al., 2019). Depending on future changes in atmospheric temperature and 44 precipitation phases, occurrence of superimposed ice might also become a scenario seen more often than 45 today. 46 47 Radiative fluxes and the snow cover on sea ice are closely connected. Snow has a higher surface albedo than 48 a bare sea ice surface (Figure Atlas.50:). The timing of snow precipitation and snow melt relative to solar 49 elevation is therefore important for the surface energy balance in a sea-ice covered region (e.g., Perovich et 50 al., 2017; Perovich and Polashenski, 2012). Snow along with atmospheric forcing and sea-ice topography 51 determines how and when melt ponds on sea ice form in summer months. Melt ponds however lower the 52 albedo. 53 54 The snow cover on sea ice has a major influence on the light budget available for ice-associated biota in and 55 </span></div></body></html>
