It could be that these movements don't hold together. There may be examples of them holding together and others of them not holding together, but there seems to be evidence that attending to structural injustice doesn't divide movements; it strengthens them, particularly when women are central actors (Ackerly, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and when women mobilize locally in their own vernacular, with their own &#8220;spin,&#8221; in their everyday &#8220;little nothings&#8221; for transformative change (Drumond and Rebelo, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Singh, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
