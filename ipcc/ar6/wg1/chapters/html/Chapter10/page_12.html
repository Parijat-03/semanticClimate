Although the global mean optical depth caused by anthropogenic aerosols did not change from 1975 to 2005 (Chapter&#160;6), the regional pattern changed dramatically between Europe and eastern Asia (Fiedler et&#160;al., 2017, 2019; Stevens et&#160;al., 2017). Large regional differences in present-day aerosol forcing exist with consequences for regional temperature, hydrological cycle and modes of variability (Chapter&#160;8, Section&#160;10.6). Examples of regions with a&#160;notable role for anthropogenic aerosol forcing are the Indian monsoon region (Section&#160;10.6.3) and the Mediterranean basin (Section&#160;10.6.4). Anthropogenic aerosols are also very relevant in many urban areas (Box&#160;10.3; Gao et&#160;al., 2016; Kajino et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="522.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="522.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The SRCCL assessed that nearly three-quarters of the land surface is under some form of land use, particularly in agriculture and forest management (Jia et&#160;al., 2019). The effects of land management on climate are much less studied than land cover effects although net cropland has changed little over the past 50 years, while land management has continuously changed (Jia et&#160;al., 2019). Section&#160;7.3.4.1 assesses the global influence of both land use and irrigation on the effective radiative forcings. Land cover changes and land management can influence climate locally, such as the urban heat island and non-locally as in the case of increased rainfall downwind of a&#160;city (Jia et&#160;al., 2019; Box&#160;10.3) or the monsoon circulation affected by irrigation (Section&#160;10.6.3).

For instance, in northern Belgium, Berckmans et&#160;al. (2019) found that including urbanization scenarios for the near future (up to 2035) have a&#160;comparable influence on minimum temperature (increasing it by 0.6&#176;C) to that of the GHG-induced warming under RCP8.5.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="265.18" top="186.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="186.48" x1="265.18" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 186.48; y1: 196.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.1.3.2 Internal Drivers of Regional Climate Variability</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="162.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="162.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Internal climate variability on seasonal to multi-decadal temporal scales is substantial at regional scales. This variability arises from internal modes of atmospheric and oceanic variability, intrinsically coupled climate modes, and may additionally be driven by processes other than those originating the modes. It also interacts with the response of the climate system to external forcing. The teleconnections associated with the modes are useful to understand the relationship between large and regional scales (Annex IV: Modes of Variability). A&#160;description of various large-scale modes of variability can be found in Chapters 2, 3 and 8, and in Annex IV, while their future projections </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.33" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.33" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.66; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">are briefly discussed here.

Even though these modes are internal to the climate system, their variability can be affected by anthropogenic forcings. For instance, the SAM (Hendon et&#160;al., 2014) is both internally driven (Smith and Polvani, 2017), but also affected by recent stratospheric ozone changes (Bandoro et&#160;al., 2014). The teleconnections between these modes of variability and surface weather often exhibit considerable non-stationarity (Hertig et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.34" top="546.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="546.6" x1="557.34" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Due to the large ocean heat capacity and their long temporal scales, multi-annual to multi-decadal modes of ocean variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Newman et&#160;al., 2016) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV; Buckley and Marshall, 2016) are key drivers of regional climate change. In the case of the AMV both natural (volcanic) and anthropogenic (aerosol) external forcings are thought to be involved in its timing and intensity (Section&#160;3.7.7). These modes not only affect nearby regions but also remote parts of the globe through atmospheric teleconnections (Meehl et&#160;al., 2013; Dong and Dai, 2015) and can act to modulate the influence of natural and anthropogenic forcings (Davini et&#160;al., 2015; Ghosh et&#160;al., 2017; M&#233;n&#233;goz et&#160;al., 2018b). The dynamics of the ocean modes is simultaneously affected by other modes of variability spanning the full range of spatial and temporal scales due to non-linear interactions (Figure&#160;10.3; Kucharski et&#160;al., 2010; Dong et&#160;al., 2018). This mutual interdependence can result in changing characteristics of the connection over time (Gallant et&#160;al., 2013; Brands, 2017; Dong and McPhaden, 2017), and of their regional climate impact (Mart&#237;n-G&#243;mez and Barreiro, 2016, 2017). As with atmospheric modes of variability, the regional influence of ocean modes of variability on regional climates can be seasonally dependent (Haarsma et&#160;al.,&#160;2015).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="454.11" top="282.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="282.48" x1="454.11" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 282.48; y1: 292.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.1.3.3 Uncertainty and Confidence</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="258.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="258.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.88; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Uncertainty and confidence are treated in the same way in regional climate change information as in larger-scale (continental and global) climate problems (Chapter&#160;1 and Section&#160;10.3.4). The degree of confidence in climate simulations and in the resulting climate information typically depends on the identification of the role of the uncertainties (Section&#160;10.3.4). Since the direct verification of simulations of future climate changes is not possible, model performance and reliable (i.e., trustworthy) uncertainty estimates need to be assessed indirectly through process understanding and a&#160;systematic comparison with observations of past and current climate (Section&#160;10.3.3; Knutti et&#160;al., 2010; Eyring et&#160;al., 2019). The observational uncertainty, which is particularly large at regional scales, also has to be taken into account (Section&#160;10.2). These uncertainty estimates are then propagated in the distillation process to generate climate information.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="78.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="78.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.88; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Uncertainties in model-based future regional climate information arise from different sources and are introduced at various stages in the process (Lehner et&#160;al., 2020): (i) forcing uncertainties associated with </span></div></body></html>
