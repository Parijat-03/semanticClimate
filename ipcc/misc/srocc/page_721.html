The European Union Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED) established sustainability criteria in relation to EU renewable energy targets in the transport sector (European Commission 2012), which subsequently had impacts on land use and trade with third-party countries (Johnson et al. 2012). In particular, the EU-RED marked a&#160;departure in the context of Kyoto/UNFCCC guidelines by extending responsibility for emissions beyond the borders of &#64257;nal use, and requiring developing countries wishing to sell into the EU market to meet the sustainability criteria (Johnson 2011b). The recently revised EU-RED provides sustainability criteria that include management of land and forestry as well as socio-economic aspects (European Union 2018; Faaij 2018; Stattman et al. 2018b). Standards and certi&#64257;cation aim to address potential con&#64258;icts between different uses of biomass, and most schemes also consider co-bene&#64257;ts and synergies (see Cross-Chapter Box&#160;7 in Chapter&#160;6). Bioenergy may offer additional income and livelihoods to farmers as well as improvements in technical productivity and multi-functional landscapes (Rosillo Call&#233; and Johnson 2010a; Kline et al. 2017; Araujo Enciso et al. 2016). Results depend on the commodities involved, and also differ between rural and urban areas.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="411.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 411.57; y1: 421.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="411.57" x1="313.21">Analyses on the implementation of standards and certi&#64257;cation for land and biomass use have focused on their stringency, effectiveness and geographical scope as well as socio-economic impacts such as land tenure, gender and land rights (Diaz-Chavez 2011; German and Schoneveld 2012; Meyer and Priess 2014). The level of stringency and enforcement varies with local environmental conditions, governance approaches and the nature of the feedstock produced (Endres et al. 2015; Lambin et al. 2014; Giessen et al. 2016b; Stattman et al. 2018b).

There can be trade-offs across different options, especially between health and climate bene&#64257;ts, since more ef&#64257;cient wood stoves might have only limited effect, whereas gaseous and liquid fuels (e.g., biogas, LPG, bioethanol) will have highly positive health bene&#64257;ts and climate bene&#64257;ts that vary depending on speci&#64257;c circumstances of the substitution (Cameron et al. 2016; Goldemberg et al. 2018b).
