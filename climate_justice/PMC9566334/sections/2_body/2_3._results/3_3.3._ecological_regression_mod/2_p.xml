<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The second model used the <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> index as an explanatory variable with SUHI intensity averaged across each city throughout the study time-period (n = 3056) as the response. The coefficient, confidence envelope and intercept are shown in the lower section of <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The second model presents a statistically significant association between <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> and mean yearly summertime SUHI intensity with a mean posterior &#946; of 0.42. &#947;<sub>t</sub>, the temporally structured effect, displayed a similar pattern to the census tract-level analysis with a statistically significant approximated increase of 0.01 K per year on average (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
