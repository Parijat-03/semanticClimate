These include employment and working conditions, housework and caregiving, income and the economic situation, housing and the material situation, the residential environment, social capital, social support, and social networks, as well as education.

At the same time, this unequal access modulates exposure to the effects of climate change and adaptive capacity, thus exacerbating social inequalities in health.</p>
