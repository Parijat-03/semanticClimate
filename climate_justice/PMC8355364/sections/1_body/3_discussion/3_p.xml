This instrumental aspect of our findings is consistent with the existing literature, in which the expectation that group action can do something to address grievances is one of the important and often replicated predictors of participation in collective action (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Klandermans, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">van Stekelenburg and Klandermans, 2013</xref>). The fact that no text passages could be coded in the category of participatory self-efficacy expectations suggests that this category might not be too relevant for newcomers to student initiatives. There are corresponding findings from studies by <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bamberg et al. (2015)</xref> and <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Mazzoni et al. (2015)</xref>, showing that participatory and collective self-efficacy expectations have different relevance for newcomers with the intention of participating, compared to those already involved. Such expectations are predictive of ongoing participation in collective action, especially for established activists.</p>
