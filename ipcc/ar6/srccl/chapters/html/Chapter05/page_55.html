Consumer choice and dietary preferences are guided by social, cultural, environmental, and traditional factors as well as economic growth. The food consumed by a&#160;given group conveys cultural significance about social hierarchy, social systems and human-environment relationships (Herforth and Ahmed 2015). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="579.12"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 579.12; y1: 588.62; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="579.12" x1="313.27">As suggested by Springmann et al. (2018a), per capita dietary emissions will translate into different realised diets, according to regional contexts including cultural and gendered norms (e.g.,&#160;among some groups, eating meat is perceived as more masculine (Ruby and Heine 2011). In some cases, women and men have different preferences in terms of food, with women reporting eating healthier food (Imamura et al. 2015; Kiefer et al. 2005; Fagerli and Wandel 1999): these studies found that men tend to eat more meat, while women eat more vegetables, fruits and dairy products (Kanter and Caballero 2012). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="447.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 447.13; y1: 456.63; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.13" x1="313.24">Food preferences can change over time, with the nutrition transition from traditional diets to high-meat, high-sugar, high-saturated fat diets being a&#160;clear example of significant changes occurring in a&#160;short period of time. Meat consumption per capita consistently responds to income with a&#160;saturating trend at high income levels (Sans and Combris 2015; Vranken et al. 2014). Some emerging economies have rapidly increased demand for beef, leading to pressure on natural resources (Bowles et al. 2019). In another example, by reducing beef consumption between 2005 and 2014, Americans avoided approximately 271&#160;million metric tonnes of emissions (CO</span><span style="x0: 293.53; x1: 296.72; y0: 338.92; y1: 345.57; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="293.53" y0="338.92" x1="296.72">2</span><span style="x0: 296.72; x1: 299.53; y0: 339.11; y1: 348.61; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="296.72" y0="339.11" x1="313.24">-eq) (NRDC 2017). Attending farmers markets or buying directly from local producers has been shown to change worldviews (Kerton and Sinclair 2010), and food habits towards healthier diets (Pascucci et al. 2011) can be advanced through active learning (Milestad et al. 2010). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="267.11"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 267.11; y1: 276.61; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="267.11" x1="313.24">Regarding the options to reduce meat intake in developed countries, research shows that there is an apparent sympathy of consumers for meat reduction due to environmental impacts (Dagevos and Voordouw 2013), which has not been exploited. Social factors that influence reducing meat consumption in New Zealand include the need for better education or information dispersal regarding perceived barriers to producing meat-reduced/less meals; ensuring there is sensory or aesthetic appeal; and placing emphasis on human health or nutritional benefits (Tucker 2018). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="147.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 147.13; y1: 156.63; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="147.13" x1="313.23">Different and complementary strategies can be used in parallel for different consumer&#8217;s profiles to facilitate step-by-step changes in the amounts and the sources of protein consumed. In the Netherlands, a&#160;nationwide sample of 1083 consumers were used to study their dietary choices toward smaller portions of meat, smaller portions using meat raised in a&#160;more sustainable manner, smaller portions and eating more vegetable protein, and meatless meals with or without meat substitutes.

However, analysing ruminant meat production is highly complex because of the extreme heterogeneity of production systems and due to the numerous products and services associated with ruminants (Gerber et al. 2015). See Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for further discussion of uncertainties in estimates of livestock mitigation technical potential. Further, current market mechanisms are regarded as insufficient to decrease consumption or increase efficiency, and governmental intervention is often suggested to encourage mitigation in both the supply-side and demand-side of the food system (Section&#160;5.7) (Wirsenius et al. 2011; Henderson et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="471.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.11; y0: 471.13; y1: 480.63; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="471.13" x1="571.77">Minimising GHG emissions through mathematical programming with near-minimal acceptability constraints can be understood as a&#160;reference or technical potential for mitigation through diet shifts. In this context (Macdiarmid et al. 2012) found up to 36% reduction in emissions in UK with similar diet costs applying fixed lifecycle analyses (LCA) carbon footprints (i.e.,&#160;no rebound effects considered). Westhoek et al. (2014) found 25&#8211;40%&#160;in emissions by halving meat, dairy and egg&#160;intake in the EU, applying standard IPCC fixed emission intensity factors. Uncertainty about the consequences of on-the-ground implementation of policies towards low ruminant meat consumption in the food system and their externalities remain noteworthy. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="327.15"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 327.15; y1: 336.65; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="327.15" x1="571.74">Often, all emissions are allocated only to human edible meat and the boundaries are set only within the farm gate (Henderson et al. 2018; Gerber et al. 2013). However, less than 50% of slaughtered cattle weight is human edible meat, and&#160;1&#8211;10% of the mass is lost or incinerated, depending on specified risk materials legislation. The remaining mass provide inputs to multiple industries, for example clothing, furniture, vehicle coating materials, biofuel, gelatine, soap, cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industrial supplies, pet feed ingredients and fertilisers (Marti et al. 2011; Mogensen et al. 2016; Sousa et al. 2017). This makes ruminant meat production one of the most complex problems for LCA in the food system (Place and Mitloehner 2012; de&#160;Boer et al. 2011). There are only a&#160;few examples taking into account slaughter by-products (Mogensen et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="431.52" top="158.98"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 158.98; y1: 168.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="158.98" x1="431.52">1.5.2.4 Insect-based diets</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="135.11"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 135.11; y1: 144.61; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="135.11" x1="571.8">Edible insects are, in general, rich in protein, fat, and energy and can be a&#160;significant source of vitamins and minerals (Rumpold and Schl&#252;ter 2015).
