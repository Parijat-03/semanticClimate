<p>Another example of the use of political and cultural methodologies in learning about
community development is demonstrated by a group of social work students who engaged in a
walking conversation (&#8216;Defying Boundaries Walk&#8217;) which is the walk from Boundary
Street in Spring Hill to Boundary Street in West End in Brisbane, Queensland that marks the
former borders enforced by policies of exclusion towards Aboriginal Australians that existed
until 1967. The students posed the question &#8216;what can we do to contribute to
reconciliation on an everyday level?&#8217; They aimed to educate and break down barriers
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. They walked, conversed with passers-by and
captured key words and ideas on a communing board. Touraine&#8217;s work on social activism
reinforces this idea of human agency where civil society actors engage in social change
practices which may be cultural rather than overtly political (see <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Ottman and Noble, 2020</xref>). With a focus on climate change, social work
students at University College Cork engaged in critical reflection by walking through their
neighbourhoods and answering a series of pre-determined questions about what they saw there, in
environmental, social and economic terms. In class the students shared their reflections in
small groups and explored the implications of climate change for social work practice across
the three domains.</p>
