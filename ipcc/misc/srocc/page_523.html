For example, in 2007&#8211;2009, 46% of OECD support for agriculture was based on measures of output (price support or payments based on yields), 37% of support was based on the current or historical area planted, herd size (or correlated measures of the notional costs of farming), and 13% was payments linked to input prices.

Almost every country has a&#160;reliance on trade to ful&#64257;l some or all of its local food needs, and trade networks have grown to be highly complex (Puma et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2015; Fader et al. 2013 and Ercsey-Ravasz et al. 2012). This is because many countries lack the capacity to produce suf&#64257;cient food due to climatic conditions, soil quality, water constraints, and availability of farmland (FAO 2015b). In a&#160;world of liberalised trade, using comparative advantage to maximise production in high-yielding commodities, exporting excess production, and importing supplies of other goods supports economic growth. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="243.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 243.55; y1: 253.05; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.55" x1="571.75">City states as well as many small island states, do not have adequate farmland to feed their populations, while Sub-Saharan African countries are projected to experience high population growth as well as to be negatively impacted by climate change, and thus will likely &#64257;nd it dif&#64257;cult to produce all of their own food supplies (Agarwal et al. 2002).
