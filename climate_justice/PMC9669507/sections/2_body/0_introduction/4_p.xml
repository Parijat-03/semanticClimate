<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our findings contribute a typology of responses to predictive journalism that
articulates three main themes (<italic toggle="yes">affective, action-oriented</italic>, and
<italic toggle="yes">evaluative</italic> responses) as well as several subthemes which
emerged from the thematic analysis of readers&#8217; comments in our sample. We found that
the focal point of readers&#8217; comments was largely on the predictive models described
in the sampled articles; thus, these themes reflect readers&#8217; responses that are
specific to the models. <italic toggle="yes">Affective response</italic> reflects the emotions
expressed as a result of analyzing and interpreting the models.
<italic toggle="yes">Action-oriented response</italic> includes all comments requesting or
demanding an action to be taken based on the numbers conveyed by the models.
<italic toggle="yes">Evaluative response</italic> comprises a variety of supporting and
critical comments that are relevant to the models.</p>
