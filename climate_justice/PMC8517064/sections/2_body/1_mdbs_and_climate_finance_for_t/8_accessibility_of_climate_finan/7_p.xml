Until now, much of the adaptation financing in agriculture has been focused solely on food production, with limited focus on the full range of food system vulnerability and implications for livelihoods and food security (Conevska et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). According to Chiriac et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>), fance benefitting individual small-scale producers (16%) and cooperatives, or farmer associations (15%) combined, constitute another large share of overall adaptation finance aimed at agricultural and rural development. It indicates the strong focus of climate finance on agricultural production at farm level.</p>
