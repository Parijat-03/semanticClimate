<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When a child presents with a health concern, either acute or chronic, the ND is trained to seek to explore the cause(s) of the concern, both proximal and distal. A core aspect of the naturopathic paradigm is to treat the individual in a holistic manner; as such, the perceived cause, and thus proposed solutions, may be different from child to child. In jurisdictions where NDs are fully integrated into the healthcare system (including prescriptive authority for pharmaceutical medications, laboratory and imaging access, ability to refer to specialists, and coverage with health insurance programs), NDs are equipped to engage in primary care, including referral to or coordination of care with other pediatric specialists when indicated. In other jurisdictions, it is ideal for families to also establish a relationship with a medical doctor in order to facilitate access to the full health system, and are encouraged by their ND to do so. </p>
