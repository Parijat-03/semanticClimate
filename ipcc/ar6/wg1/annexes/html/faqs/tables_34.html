      <td>There are several types of carbon budgets. Most often, the term refers to the total net amount of carbon dioxide\n(CO) that can still be emitted by human activities while limiting global warming to a specified level (e.g., 1.5&#176;C\n2\nor 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels). This is referred to as the &#8216;remaining carbon budget&#8217;. Several choices and value\njudgements have to be made before it can be unambiguously estimated. When the remaining carbon budget is\ncombined with all past CO emissions to date, a &#8216;total carbon budget&#8217; compatible with a specific global warming\n2\nlimit can also be defined. A third type of carbon budget is the &#8216;historical carbon budget&#8217;, which is a scientific way</td>

These choices can be informed by science, but ultimately represent\nsubjective choices. Once these choices have been made, to estimate the remaining carbon budget for a given\ntemperature goal, we can combine knowledge about: how much our planet has warmed already; the amount\nof warming per cumulative tonne of CO; and the amount of warming that is still expected once global net\n2\nCO emissions are brought down to zero. For example, to limit global warming to 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial\n2\nlevels with either a one-in-two (50%) or two-in-three (67%) chance, the remaining carbon budgets amount\nto 500 and 400 billion tonnes of CO respectively, from 1 January 2020 onward (FAQ 5.4, Figure 1).

It describes how the CO emissions from human activities\n2 2\nhave redistributed across the various CO reservoirs of the Earth system. These reservoirs are the ocean, the land\n2\nvegetation, and the atmosphere (into which CO was emitted). The share of CO that is not taken up by the\n2 2\nocean or the land, and that thus increases the concentration of CO in the atmosphere, causes global warming.\n2\nThe historical carbon budget tells us that, of the about 2560 billion tonnes of CO that were released into the\n2\natmosphere by human activities between the years 1750 and 2019, about a quarter were absorbed by the ocean\n(causing ocean acidification) and about a third by the land vegetation. About 45% of these emissions remain in\nthe atmosphere (see FAQ 5.1). Adding these historical CO emissions to estimates of remaining carbon budgets\n2\nallows an estimate of the total carbon budget consistent with a specific global warming level.</td>
