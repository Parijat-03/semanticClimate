Decreases in drinking water supplies due to reduced glacier and snowmelt water have been reported for rural areas in the Nepal Himalaya (McDowell et al., 2013; Dangi et al., 2018), but the tropical Andes have received the most attention, including both urban conglomerates and some rural areas, where water resources are especially vulnerable to climate change due to water scarcity and increased demands (Chevallier et al., 2011; Somers et al., 2018), amidst rapidly retreating glaciers (Burns and Nolin, 2014).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.97" top="579.54"><span x0="64.91" y0="579.54" x1="312.97" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The contribution of glacier water to the water supply of La Paz, Bolivia, between 1963&#8211;2006 was assessed at 15% annually and 27% during the dry season (Soruco et al., 2015), though rising as high as 86% during extreme drought months (Buytaert and De Bi&#232;vre, 2012). Despite a 50% area loss, the glacier retreat has not contributed to reduced water supplies for the city, because increased melt rates have compensated for reductions in glacier volume. However, for a complete disappearance of the glaciers, assuming no change in precipitation, a reduction in annual runoff by 12% and 24% in the dry season was projected (Soruco et al., 2015) similar to reductions projected by 2050 under a RCP8.5 scenario for a basin in southern Peru (Drenkhan et al., 2019). Huaraz and Huancayo in Peru are other cities with high average contribution of melt water to surface water resources (up to ~20%; Buytaert et al., 2017) and rapid glacier retreat in their headwaters (Rabatel et al., 2013).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.95" top="387.56"><span x0="64.91" y0="387.56" x1="312.95" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.73; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Overall, risks to water security and related vulnerabilities are highly heterogeneous varying even at small spatial scales with populations closer to the glaciers being more vulnerable, especially during dry months and droughts (Buytaert et al., 2017; Mark et al., 2017).  A regional-scale modelling study including all of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru (Buytaert et al., 2017) estimated that roughly 390,000 domestic water users, mostly in Peru, rely on a high (&gt;25%) long-term average contribution from glacier melt, with this number rising to almost 4&#160;million in the driest month of a drought year.

Regional-scale water balance simulations forced by multi-model climate projections (Buytaert and De Bi&#232;vre, 2012), suggest a relatively limited effect of glacier retreat on water supply in four major cities (Bogota, La Paz, Lima, Quito) due to the dominance of human factors in&#64258;uencing water supply (Carey et al., 2014; Mark et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018), though uncertainties are large. Population growth and limited funding for infrastructure maintenance exacerbate water scarcity, though water managers have established programs in Quito and in Huancayo and the Santa and Vilcanota basins (Peru) to improve water management through innovations in grey infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptations (Buytaert and De Bi&#232;vre, 2012; Buytaert et al., 2017; Somers et al., 2018).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="146.5" top="87.6"><span x0="64.91" y0="87.6" x1="146.5" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In summary, there is </span><span style="x0: 148.67; x1: 150.78; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="148.67" y0="87.6" x1="211.85">limited evidence </span><span x0="214.02" y0="87.6" x1="216.66" style="x0: 214.02; x1: 216.66; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(</span><span style="x0: 216.66; x1: 223.52; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="216.66" y0="87.6" x1="288.99">medium agreement</span><span x0="288.99" y0="87.6" x1="312.96" style="x0: 288.99; x1: 291.63; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) that glacier decline places increased risks to drinking water supply.

For example, in Central Asia, competing demand for water for hydropower and irrigation between upstream and downstream countries has raised tensions (Bernauer and Siegfried, 2012; Bocchiola et al., 2017). Similarly, competing demand for water is also reported in Chile (Vald&#233;s-Pineda et al., 2014) and in Peru (Vuille, 2013; Drenkhan et al., 2015). Since AR5, some studies have examined the impacts and risks related to projections of cryosphere-related changes in stream&#64258;ow in transboundary basins in the 21st century, and suggest that these changes create barriers in effectively managing water in some settings (</span><span style="x0: 482.17; x1: 489.03; y0: 351.56; y1: 361.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="482.17" y0="351.56" x1="551.73">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span x0="551.73" y0="351.56" x1="554.37" style="x0: 551.73; x1: 554.37; y0: 351.56; y1: 361.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">)</span><span style="x0: 554.37; x1: 556.65; y0: 351.56; y1: 361.06; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="554.37" y0="351.56" x1="558.93">. </span><span x0="558.13" y0="351.56" x1="571.5" style="x0: 558.13; x1: 562.18; y0: 351.56; y1: 361.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">For instance, within the transnational Indus River basin, climate change impacts may reduce stream&#64258;ow by the end of this century, thus putting pressure on established water sharing arrangements between nations (Jamir, 2016) and subnational administrative units (Yang et al., 2014b). In this basin, management efforts may be hampered by current legal and regulatory frameworks for evaluating new dams, which do not take into account changes in stream&#64258;ow that may result from climate change (Raman, 2018). Within the transnational Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins in Central Asia, competition for water between multiple uses, exacerbated by reductions in &#64258;ow later in this century, may hamper future coordination (Reyer et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019).
