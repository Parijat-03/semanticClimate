For example, the Maldives has set up climate relocation funds for the potential purchase of land in Sri Lanka or India (<xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Kothari, 2014</xref>). Similarly, in 2014, the government of Kiribati purchased a 20&#160;km<sup>2</sup> expanse of land in Fiji for US$8.77 million to relocate its people should SLR inundate their Island (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Caramel, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">Hermann and Kempf, 2017</xref>). Fiji, in turn, has invested funds in developing a legal framework to help climate-displaced communities relocating to their country (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Bourke, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in 2018, Fiji released the Planned Relocation Guidelines, becoming the first country to develop a national framework for guiding relocation processes (<xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">National Legislative Bodies, 2018</xref>). Fiji also established a Climate Relocation and Displaced People&#8217;s Trust Fund to assist CDPs. To date, this island nation has completed five full relocations of coastal villages threatened by SLR (<xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Goering, 2020</xref>). To support these efforts, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, donated $2 million to the Fiji Relocation Trust Fund (<xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Goering, 2020</xref>). These forms of cooperation show how MR might facilitate the resettling of CDPs compared to cross-border CM.</p>
