<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The growth of CS is apparent by the increasing number of projects on CS platforms such as Zooniverse, eu-citizen.science<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> or scistarter<xref rid="fn0002" ref-type="fn"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Scistarter alone lists over 1,600 and the numbers are growing. CS growth is also reflected by the number of academic publications which have risen exponentially over the last two decades (Pelacho et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Such publications include scientific findings derived from CS data, in addition to research on project design, infrastructure, benefits for participants, and more (Kullenberg and Kasperowski, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
