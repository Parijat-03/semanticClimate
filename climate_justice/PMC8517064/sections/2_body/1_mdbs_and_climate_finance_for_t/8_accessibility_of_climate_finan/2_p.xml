Access to climate dedicated funds requires capacity to provide detailed analysis of the problems and solutions the investment is aimed at, essentially generating significant transactions costs in obtaining financing. Such capacity is difficult to attain for low income &#8211; and even some medium income countries. Addressing this shortcoming is where MDBs have certain advantages.</p>
