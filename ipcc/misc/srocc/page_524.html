However, the bene&#64257;ts of trade will only be realised if trade is managed in ways that maximise broadened access to new markets while minimising the risks of increased exposure to international competition and market volatility (Challinor et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2017b). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="651.53"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 651.53; y1: 661.03; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="651.53" x1="307.55">As described in Section&#160;5.8.1, trade acts to buffer exposure to climate risks when the market works well.

Lower food prices that result from subsidy support may bene&#64257;t urban consumers in importing countries, but at the same time they may hurt farmers&#8217; incomes in those same countries. The outmigration of smallholder farmers from the agriculture sector across the Global South is signi&#64257;cantly attributed to these trade patterns of cheap food imports (Wittman 2011; McMichael 2014; Akram-Lodhi et al. 2013). Food production and trade cartels, as well as &#64257;nancial speculation on food futures markets, affect low-income market-dependent populations. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.61" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="411.56" x1="307.61">Food sovereignty is a&#160;framing developed to conceptualise these issues (Reuter 2015). They directly relate to the ability of local communities and nations to build their food systems, based, among other aspects, on diversi&#64257;ed crops and ILK. If a&#160;country enters international markets by growing more commodity crops and reducing local crop varieties, it may get economic bene&#64257;ts, but may also expose itself to climate risks and food insecurity by increasing reliance on trade, which may be increasingly disrupted by climate risks. These include a&#160;local lack of resilience from reduced diversity of products, but also exposure to food price spikes, which can become ampli&#64257;ed by market mechanisms such as speculation.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="267.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 267.57; y1: 277.07; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="267.57" x1="307.58">In summary, countries must determine the balance between locally produced versus imported food (and feed) such that it both minimises climate risks and ensures sustainable food security.

Novel incentives can stimulate the market, for example, through reduction in waste or changes in diets to gain bene&#64257;ts from a&#160;health or sustainability direction. Different contexts with different needs will require different set of policies at local, regional and national levels.
