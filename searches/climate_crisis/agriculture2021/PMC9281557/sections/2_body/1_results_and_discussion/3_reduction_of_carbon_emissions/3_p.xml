Recent data show a 10% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels, which will undoubtedly bend the curve, which is the highest rate of emissions reduction since World War II. Carbon emissions fell 1.4% for the first time during the 2008 financial crisis,<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> but emissions in 2020 are expected to decrease by approximately 5% (2.5 billion). The trends of changes in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions growth in 2000&#8211;2009, 2010&#8211;2018, and 2019&#8211;2020 were +&#160;3, +&#160;0.9, and +&#160;0.6%, respectively. The reasons for this slow increase in the demand for coal and, most recently, the coronavirus pandemic consequences.<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>
