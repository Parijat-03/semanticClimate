A growing number of countries have achieved GHG emission reductions longer than 10 years – 38 a few at rates that are broadly consistent with climate change mitigation scenarios that limitwarming to well below 2°C (high confidence).

There are about 24 countries that have reduced CO2 1 and GHG emissions for longer than 10 years. Reduction rates in a few countries have reached 4% in 2 some years, in line with rates observed in pathways that likely limit warming to 2°C. However, the total 3 reduction in annual GHG emissions of these countries is small (about 3.2 GtCO2eqyr-1) compared to 4 global emissions growth observed over the last decades. Complementary evidence suggests that 5 countries have decoupled territorial CO2 emissions from Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but fewer 6 have decoupled consumption-based emissions from GDP. This decoupling has mostly occurred in 7 countries with high per capita GDP and high per capita CO2 emissions. {2.2.3, 2.3.3, Figure 2.11, Table 8 2.3, Table 2.4}
