According to this understanding, these principles can be interpreted differently as they can reflect different ethical considerations. Different interpretations of these principles and combinations of them amount to different interpretations of what allocation can be considered equitable or just. Our approach builds upon the state of the art&#8212;in particular as reflected in the IPCC, which is focused on informing policy makers&#8212;and aims to assess the implications of imposing equity or justice principles in negotiations on the allocation of emission reductions within the EU.</p>
