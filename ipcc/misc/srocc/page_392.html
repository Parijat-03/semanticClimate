The complex contribution of climate to migration and con&#64258;ict hampers retrieving any level of con&#64257;dence on climate-migration and climate-con&#64258;ict linkages, therefore constituting a&#160;major knowledge gap (Cramer et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="88.88" top="135.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 135.54; y1: 145.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="135.54" x1="88.88">There is </span><span style="x0: 88.34; x1: 90.45; y0: 135.54; y1: 145.04; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="88.34" y0="135.54" x1="137.22">low evidence </span><span style="x0: 136.69; x1: 141.27; y0: 135.54; y1: 145.04; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="136.69" y0="135.54" x1="307.57">on the causal linkages between climate change, land degradation processes (other than deserti&#64257;cation) and migration.

In the humid tropics, land degradation, mainly as a&#160;consequence of deforestation, has been a&#160;reported reason for people leaving their homes during the Amazonian colonisation (Hecht 1983) but was also observed more recently, for example in Guatemala, where soil degradation was one of the most frequently cited migration pushes (L&#243;pez-Carr 2012) and Kenya, where households respond to low soil quality by sending temporary migrants for additional income generation (Gray 2011). In contrast, in the Andean highlands and the Paci&#64257;c coastal plain, migration increased with land quality, probably because revenues from additional agricultural production was invested in costly forms of migration (Gray and Bilsborrow 2013). These mixed results illustrate the complex, non-linear relationship of land degradation&#8211;migration linkages and suggest that explaining land degradationand migration linkages requires considering a&#160;broad range of socio-ecological conditions (McLeman 2017).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="507.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 507.58; y1: 517.08; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="507.58" x1="566.09">In addition to people moving away from an area due to &#8216;lost&#8217; livelihood activities, climate-related land degradation can also reduce the availability of livelihood safety nets&#160;&#8211; environmental assets that people use during times of shocks or stress. For example, Barbier (2000) notes that wetlands in north-east Nigeria around Hadejia&#8211;Jama&#8217;are &#64258;oodplain provide dry season pastures for seminomadic herders, agricultural surpluses for Kano and Borno states, groundwater recharge of the Chad formation aquifer and &#8216;insurance&#8217; resources in times of drought. The &#64258;oodplain also supports many migratory bird species. As climate change and land degradation combine, delivery of these multiple services can be undermined, particularly as droughts become more widespread, reducing the utility of this wetland environment as a&#160;safety net for people and wildlife alike.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="339.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.45; y0: 339.59; y1: 349.09; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="339.59" x1="566.12">Early studies conducted in Africa hint at a&#160;signi&#64257;cant causal link between land degradation and violent con&#64258;ict (Homer-Dixon et al. 1993).
