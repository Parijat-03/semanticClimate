The processes of climate change and their effects in the region have serious implications for Pacific Island nations as they influence the environments that are their &#8216;life-support systems&#8217; (Campbell 2014). Climate variability poses significant threats to both agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures and reductions in groundwater availability, as well as increasing frequency and severity of disaster events translate into substantial impacts on food security, causing human displacement, a&#160;trend that will be aggravated by future climate impacts (ADB 2017). Declining soil productivity, groundwater depletion, and non-availability of freshwater threatens agricultural production in many remote atolls. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.59" top="603.12"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.76; y0: 603.12; y1: 612.62; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="603.12" x1="557.59">Many countries in the Pacific devote a&#160;large share of available land area to agricultural production. For example, more than 60%&#160;of&#160;land area is cultivated in the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu and more than 40% in Kiribati and Tonga. With few options to expand agricultural area, the projected impacts of climate change on food production are of particular concern (ADB 2013, 2017). The degradation of available land area for traditional agriculture, adverse disruptions of agricultural productivity and diminishing livelihood opportunities through climate change impacts leads to increasing poverty and food insecurity, incentivising migration to&#160;urban agglomerations (ADB 2017; FAO et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="519.13"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.47; y0: 519.13; y1: 528.63; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="519.13" x1="557.6">Campbell (2014) describe the trends that lead to migration. First, climate change, including rising sea levels, affects communities&#8217; land security, which is the physical presence on which to live and sustain livelihoods. Second, they impinge on livelihood security (especially food security) of island communities where the productivity of both subsistence and commercial food production systems is reduced. Third, the effects of climate change are especially severe on small-island environments since they result in declining ecological habitat. The effects on island systems are mostly manifested in atolls through erosion and inundation, and on human populations through migration.

Especially in small islands, the range and&#160;nature of the interactions among economic, social, and/or political drivers are complex. For example, in the Maldives, Stojanov&#160;et al. (2017) show that while collective perceptions support climate change impacts as being one of the key factors prompting migration, individual perceptions give more credence to other cultural, religious, economic or social factors. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.54" top="339.15"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 339.15; y1: 348.65; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="339.15" x1="557.54">In the Pacific, Tuvalu has long been a&#160;prime candidate to disappear due to rising sea levels, forcing human migration. However, results of a&#160;recent study (Kench et al. 2018) challenge perceptions of island loss in Tuvalu, reporting that there is a&#160;net increase in land area of 73.5&#160;ha. The findings suggest that islands are dynamic features likely to persist as habitation sites over the next century, presenting opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and processes. Farbotko (2010) and&#160;Farbotko and Lazrus (2012) present Tuvalu as a&#160;site of &#8216;wishful sinking&#8217;, in the climate change discourse. These authors argue that representations of Tuvalu as a&#160;laboratory for global climate change migration are visualisations by non-locals. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.55" top="255.16"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 255.16; y1: 264.66; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="255.16" x1="557.55">In Nanumea (Tuvalu), forced displacements and voluntary migrations are complex decisions made by individuals, families and&#160;communities in response to discourses on risk, deteriorating infrastructure and other economic and social pressures (Marino&#160;and&#160;Lazrus 2015). In&#160;many atoll nations in the Western Pacific, migration has increasingly become a&#160;sustainable livelihood&#160;strategy,&#160;irrespective of climate change (Connell 2015). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.62" top="195.17"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 195.17; y1: 204.67; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="195.17" x1="557.62">In Lamen Bay, Vanuatu, migration is both a&#160;cause and consequence of local vulnerabilities. While migration provides an opportunity&#160;for households to meet their immediate economic needs, it limits the ability of the community to foster longer-term economic development. At the same time, migration adversely affects the ability of the community to maintain food security due to&#160;lost labour and changing attitudes towards traditional ways of life among community members (Craven 2015).</span></div></body></html>
