At the Copenhagen Summit, however, the developing world split. For instance, many countries from the AOSIS, Latin America and Africa stood with many developed countries to demand for a new legally binding deal, while China responded with a rather harsh objection and urged a focus on implementing the existing commitments under the Convention and Protocol (ENB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>). China established a new coalition&#8212;the BASIC group with another three emerging economies and acted jointly to defend the CBDR principle and reject legally binding obligations on them (Hochstetler and Milkoreit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). The Copenhagen Accord&#8212;the final political text reached by the BASIC countries and the USA&#8212;was just &#8216;taken note&#8217; by the Conference Plenary because of the opposition of some developing countries (Dimitrov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>).</p>
