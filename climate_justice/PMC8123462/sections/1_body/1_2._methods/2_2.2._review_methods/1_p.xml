Sources were collected from PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Environmental Complete, Sociological Abstracts, and Global Health databases, using relevant search terms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-04573-f001">Figure 1</xref> for keyword searches). Although this number of databases would give multiple duplicates, it improved rigor by ensuring researchers found more articles on the topic.</p>
