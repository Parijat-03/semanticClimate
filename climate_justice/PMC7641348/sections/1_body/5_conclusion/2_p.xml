Understanding of how to equitably adapt to extreme heat is emerging and advancing. Although this study is region specific and heat specific, lessons from this work about how we consider vulnerability can be applied across different locations, scales, and hazards. There are many opportunities to increase resiliency and address inequities across communities.</p>
