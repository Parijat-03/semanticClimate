The important conclusion for the benefit of this paper was showing how companies waver in their position over time. Their initial reaction is to prevent such regulation, but if they see that it is unavoidable then they want the opportunity to treat it as a positive and be a global leader in new product development. This links with the short- and long-term views as discussed above by Burress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>) and also the role of policy feedback (Green, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>; Jordan &amp; Matt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Drawing on the arguments of Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>) on depoliticisation, MBMs must, therefore, be viewed not only in terms of their direct outcomes but in terms of the role they play in policy feedback and sending a clear message so that firms can switch their perspective to a long-term view of transitioning away from fossil fuels.</p>
