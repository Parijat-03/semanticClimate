<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">An extreme/heavy precipitation event is an event that is of very high magnitude with a very rare occurrence at a particular place.</p>
<p>Types of extreme precipitation may vary depending on its duration, hourly, daily or multi-days (e.g., 5 days), though all of them qualitatively represent high magnitude. The intensity of such events may be defined with<br>block maxima approach such as annual maxima or with peak over threshold approach, such as rainfall above 95th or 99th percentile at a particular space.</p>
