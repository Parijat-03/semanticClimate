In this sense, as a &#8220;red alert for humanity,&#8221; the first part of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (The Physical Science Basis) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>) emphasizes that a radical civilizational transformation is needed in this decade to avoid unpredictable changes, in the case of an average increase in temperature greater than 1.5 &#176;C. However, even if the carbon emission neutrality and the net-zero goals of the Paris Agreement are achieved, according to the same report, this increase is most likely to reach 2.2 &#176;C, which further reinforces the need for transformative transitions to radical systemic changes.</p>
