<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para50">Climate ambition barely increased with new climate commitments. As identified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, collective commitments in the 48 new or updated national pledges put nations on a path to cut global emissions by 0&#183;5% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. However, emission reductions of at least 45% are needed by 2030 to limit average global temperature rise to 1&#183;5&#176;C.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Several NDCs have specified how the pandemic has altered governments' level of ambition, either positively (15 NDCs) or negatively (14 NDCs). To meet global climate goals all NDCs should improve ambition and transparency by specifying how the pandemic has altered their emission reduction targets, financial flows, support to vulnerable countries, and means of implementation. Strengthened climate targets and well-directed financing at this important stage could help sustain a permanent decline in global emissions while supporting a just, green COVID-19 recovery.</p>
