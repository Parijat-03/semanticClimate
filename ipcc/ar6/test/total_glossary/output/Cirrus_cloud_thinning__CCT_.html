<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">One of several radiation modification approaches to counter the warming caused by <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em>. In this approach, it is proposed to reduce the amount of cirrus clouds by injecting ice nucleating substances in the upper troposphere. The reduction in cirrus clouds is expected to increase the amount of longwave cooling to space resulting in a planetary cooling. Although cirrus cloud thinning primarily affects the longwave radiation budget of our planet, it is often identified as one of the <em>solar radiation modification (SRM)</em> approaches in the literature.</p>
