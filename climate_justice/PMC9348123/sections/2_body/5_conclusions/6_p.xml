For example, in the adults' networks, people are highly interested in information on COVID&#8208;19 from universities and journals, whereas they barely care about news media. In contrast, in the elderly's networks, they show the opposite characteristics of adults. Therefore, governments and policymakers should provide important information and useful data sources according to their characteristics.</p>
