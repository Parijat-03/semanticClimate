Perhaps exploring the world and the social practices related to animal farming are examples.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn37">37</xref> As mentioned in the previous paragraph, I accept that other capabilities could also be given this special status in matters of distributive justice. In fact, one might argue that we already have such a list&#8212;the list of basic human rights. And while this list includes some limited levels of mobility and certainly includes being well nourished (capabilities that can be realized in a manner that causes only limited environmental damage if one eats primarily plant-based foods), it does not include world travel, nor animal farming if there are other means of income generation and food production available. A critic who wanted to push this objection would have to give more elaborate arguments about why world travel (rather than geographically more restricted travel) and animal farming (beyond subsistence or small scale, but rather the large-scale farming that is causing the vast emissions) are needed to see oneself as human. I am very skeptical that such accounts can be given. It is correct that the argument from human self-understanding potentially opens a can of worms in that there are potentially many more activities or capabilities than procreative parenting of which one might say that denying their special nature for purposes of distributive justice could reasonably be seen as an act of dehumanization. The conclusion is that this is the debate we would need to have if we were to accept that the argument from human self-understanding should be given moral weight in judgments about distributive justice.</p>
