The SAsiaM region extends across vast geographical areas and several countries, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines. The SAsiaM starts in late May/early June and progresses towards the north-east, ending in late September/early October. During the core monsoon season, maxima of SAsiaM precipitation are located over the west coast, north-east and central north India, Myanmar and Bangladesh, whereas minima are located over north-west and south-eastern India, western Pakistan, and southeastern and northern Sri Lanka. Further details on how SAsiaM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Global monsoon" data-phraseid="4690">Global monsoon</span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>
