Attempts to create and propagate participative platforms advocated at this time significantly failed through a combination of low utilisation and limited state interest in cultivating and connecting with them. Even where public management has embraced notions of popular legitimacy, such as the focus on connecting administration to public legitimacy through the reclassification of public sector management as the creation of &#8220;public value&#8221;, this has not led to an embrace of participative media by public managers (Bol&#237;var <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>).</p>
