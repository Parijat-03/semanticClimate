At least 80 <italic toggle="yes">billion</italic> chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, ducks, and geese are raised and slaughtered globally each year. Feeding those animals, who are usually confined in crowded sheds or barren feedlots, requires vast quantities of corn, soybeans, or other grains, as well as the routine use of antibiotics to accelerate the animals&#8217; growth to &#8220;slaughter weight&#8221; and keep them alive in insalubrious surroundings.</p>
