      <td>Natural variability refers to variations in climate that are caused by processes other than human influence.\nIt includes variability that is internally generated within the climate system and variability that is driven by\nnatural external factors. Natural variability is a major cause of year-to-year changes in global surface climate and\ncan play a prominent role in trends over multiple years or even decades. But the influence of natural variability\nis typically small when considering trends over periods of multiple decades or longer. When estimated over the\nentire historical period (1850&#8211;2020), the contribution of natural variability to global surface warming of &#8211;0.23&#176;C\nto +0.23&#176;C is small compared to the warming of about 1.1&#176;C observed during the same period, which has been</td>

      <td>climate models all show that global surface temperatures have changed significantly over a wide range of time\nscales in the past. One of these reasons is natural variability, which refers to variations in climate that are either\ninternally generated within the climate system or externally driven by natural changes. Internal natural variability\ncorresponds to a redistribution of energy within the climate system (for example via atmospheric circulation\nchanges similar to those that drive the daily weather) and is most clearly observed as regional, rather than\nglobal, fluctuations in surface temperature. External natural variability can result from changes in the Earth&#8217;s\norbit, small variations in energy received from the sun, or from major volcanic eruptions. Although large orbital\nchanges are related to global climate changes of the past, they operate on very long time scales (i.e., thousands\nof years). As such, they have displayed very little change over the past century and have had very little influence\non temperature changes observed over that period. On the other hand, volcanic eruptions can strongly cool the\nEarth, but this effect is short-lived and their influence on surface temperatures typically fades within a decade</td>

When only natural factors are used to force\nclimate models, the resulting simulations show variations in climate on a wide range of time scales in response to\nvolcanic eruptions, variations in solar activity, and internal natural variability. However, the influence of natural\nclimate variability typically decreases as the time period gets longer, such that it only has mild effects on multi-\ndecadal and longer trends (FAQ 3.2, Figure 1).</td>

Looking at\nglobal surface temperature changes over short periods is akin to focusing on the dog. The dog sometimes moves\nahead of the owner and other times behind. This is similar to natural variability that can weaken or amplify\nwarming on the short term. In both cases it is difficult to predict where the dog will be or how the climate will\nevolve in the near future.
