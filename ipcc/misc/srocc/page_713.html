However, Filatova (2014) found that if autonomous adaptation is downplayed, people are more likely to make land-use choices that collectively lead to increased &#64258;ood risks and leave costs to governments. Taxes and subsidies that do not encourage (and even counter) perverse behaviour (such as rebuilding in &#64258;ood zones) are important instruments mitigating this cost to government. Flood insurance has been found to be maladaptive as it encourages rebuilding in &#64258;ood zones (O&#8217;Hare et al. 2016) and government &#64258;ood disaster assistance negatively impacts on average insurance coverage the following year (Kousky et al. 2018a). Modi&#64257;cations to &#64258;ood insurance can counter perverse behaviour. One example is the provision of discounts on &#64258;ood insurance for localities that undertake one of 18 &#64258;ood mitigation activities, including structural mitigation (constructing dykes, dams, &#64258;ood control reservoirs), and non-structural initiatives such as point source control and watershed management efforts, education and maintenance of &#64258;ood-related databases (Zahran et al. 2010). Flood insurance that provides incentives for &#64258;ood mitigation, marketable permits and transferable development rights (see Case study: Flood and food security in Section&#160;7.6) instruments can provide price signals to stimulate autonomous adaptation, countering barriers of path dependency, and the time lag between private investment decisions and consequences (Filatova 2014). To build adaptive capacity, consideration needs to be made of policy instruments responding to &#64258;ood, including &#64258;ood zone mapping, land-use planning, &#64258;ood zone building restrictions, business and crop insurance, disaster assistance payments, preventative instruments, (including environmental farm planning, e.g., soil and water management (see Chapter 6)), farm infrastructure projects, and recovery from debilitating &#64258;ood losses ultimately through bankruptcy (Hurlbert 2018a). Non-structural measures have been found to advance sustainable development as they are more reversible, commonly acceptable and environmentally friendly (Kundzewicz 2002).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="251.25" top="315.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 315.42; y1: 325.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="315.42" x1="251.25">7.4.4 Policies responding to greenhouse gas&#160;(GHG)&#160;&#64258;uxes</span></div><div left="65.2" right="265.22" top="279.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 279.42; y1: 289.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="279.42" x1="265.22">7.4.4.1 GHG &#64258;uxes and climate change mitigation</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="255.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="255.52" x1="313.26">Pathways re&#64258;ecting current nationally stated mitigation ambitions as submitted under the Paris Agreement would not limit global warming to 1.5</span><span style="x0: 122.3; x1: 126.1; y0: 231.53; y1: 241.03; width: 3.8; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="122.3" y0="231.53" x1="126.1">&#176;</span><span style="x0: 126.1; x1: 131.2; y0: 231.53; y1: 241.03; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="126.1" y0="231.53" x1="313.28">C with no or limited overshoot, but instead result in a global warming of about 3</span><span style="x0: 177.48; x1: 181.28; y0: 219.53; y1: 229.03; width: 3.8; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="177.48" y0="219.53" x1="181.28">&#176;</span><span style="x0: 181.28; x1: 186.38; y0: 219.53; y1: 229.03; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="181.28" y0="219.53" x1="313.26">C by 2100 with warming continuing afterward (IPCC 2018d).

While climate change is a global commons problem containing free-riding issues cost-effective international policies that ensure that countries get the most environmental bene&#64257;t out of mitigation investments promote an international climate policy regime (Nordhaus 1999; Aldy and Stavins 2012). Carbon pricing instruments may provide an entry point for inclusion of appropriate agricultural carbon instruments. Models of cost-ef&#64257;cient distribution of mitigation across regions and sectors typically employ a global uniform carbon price, but such treatment in the agricultural sector may impact on food security (Section&#160;7.4.4.4).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.81" top="495.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 495.58; y1: 505.08; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="495.58" x1="571.81">One policy initiative to advance climate mitigation policy coherence in this section is the phase out of subsidies for fossil fuel production (see also Section&#160;7.4.8). The G20 agreed in 2009, and the G7 agreed in 2016, to phase out these subsidies by 2025. Subsidies include lower tax rates or exemptions and rebates of taxes on fuels used by particular consumers (diesel fuel used by farming, &#64257;shing, etc.), types of fuel, or how fuels are used. The OECD estimates the overall value of these subsides to be 160&#8211;200 billion&#160;USD annually between 2010 and 2014 (OECD 2015). The phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies has important economic, environmental and social bene&#64257;ts. Coady et al. (2017) estimate the economic and environmental bene&#64257;ts of reforming fossil fuel subsidies could be valued worldwide at 4.9&#160;trillion&#160;USD in&#160;2013, and 5.3 trillion&#160;USD in 2015. Eliminating subsidies could have reduced emissions by 21%, raised 4% of global GDP as revenue (in 2013), and improved social welfare (Coady&#160;et&#160;al.&#160;2017).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="303.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.59; y0: 303.6; y1: 313.1; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="303.6" x1="571.78">Legal instruments addressing perceived de&#64257;ciencies in climate change mitigation include human rights and liability.

Peel and Osofsky (2017) argue that courts are becoming increasingly receptive to employ human rights claims in climate change lawsuits (Peel and Osofsky 2017); citizen suits in domestic courts are not a universal phenomenon and, even if unsuccessful, Estrin (2016) concludes they are important in underlining the high level of public concern.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="449.87" top="147.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 147.42; y1: 157.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="147.42" x1="449.87">7.4.4.2 Mitigation instruments</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="123.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 123.52; y1: 133.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="123.52" x1="571.75">Similar instruments for mitigation could be applied to the land sector as in other sectors, including: market-based measures such as taxes and cap and trade systems; standards and regulations; subsidies&#160;and tax credits; information instruments and management tools; R&amp;D investment; and voluntary compliance programmes.
