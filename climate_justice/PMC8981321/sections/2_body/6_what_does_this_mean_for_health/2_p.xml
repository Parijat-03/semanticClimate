Specifically, from our respective positions of medical student, resident and consultant&#8212;and drawing from our interdisciplinary experience in paediatrics and psychiatry&#8212;we call for our profession to take the &#8216;leap&#8217; beyond the walls of our clinics and laboratories, and take a courageous stance on the topic of climate change.</p>
