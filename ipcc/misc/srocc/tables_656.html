      <td>Climate change results in higher impacts and risks in the 4.5 W m&#8211;2 world than in the 1.9 W m&#8211;2 world for a given SSP and these risks\nare exacerbated in SSP3 compared to SSP1 and SSP2 due to the population&#8217;s higher exposure and vulnerability. For example, the risk\nof fire is higher in warmer worlds; in the 4.5 W m&#8211;2 world, the population living in fire prone regions is higher in SSP3 (646 million)\nthan in SSP2 (560 million) (Knorr et al. 2016). Global exposure to multi-sector risk quadruples between 1.5&#176;C11 and 3&#176;C and is a factor\nof six higher in SSP3-3&#176;C than in SSP1&#8211;1.5&#176;C (Byers et al. 2018). Future risks resulting from desertification, land degradation and food\ninsecurity are lower in SSP1 compared to SSP3 at the same level of warming. For example, the transition moderate-to-high risk of\nfood insecurity occurs between 1.3 and 1.7&#176;C for SSP3, but not until 2.5 to 3.5&#176;C in SSP1 (Section 7.2).</td>

      <td>included, policy portfolios implemented, and other underlying socio-economic drivers, these pathways result in different land-use\nconsequences and their contribution to climate change mitigation. Agricultural area declines by more than 5 Mkm2 in one SSP but\nincreases by as much as 5 Mkm2 in another. The amount of energy cropland ranges from nearly zero to 11 Mkm2, depending on the SSP\nand the warming target. Forest area declines in SSP3 but increases substantially in SSP1. Subsequently, these pathways have different\nimplications for risks related to desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, and terrestrial GHG fluxes, as well as ecosystem\nservices, biodiversity, and other aspects of sustainable development.</td>
