<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Naturopathic doctors are taught to draw on conventional standards of care and algorithms to guide diagnostic reasoning and management options, while factoring in frameworks from other medical paradigms (for example, consideration of a Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis). Depending on the nature of the illness, the values of the family, and the experience and scope of the clinician, a variety of therapeutic options may be considered [<xref rid="B28-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This may include the use of botanical medicines (either topical or oral), other natural health products such as nutritional supplements or probiotics, or hydrotherapy (the therapeutic application of hot and cold water to manipulate circulation). NDs with the training and authority to do so may prescribe or administer pharmaceutical medications; or perform acupuncture, acupressure, or manual therapies (such as soft tissue or joint manipulation). Those without such authority are trained to appropriately refer to other providers when indicated. Management plans typically include recommendations for optimizing lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep habits, physical activity, stress mitigation and spending time in nature. </p>
