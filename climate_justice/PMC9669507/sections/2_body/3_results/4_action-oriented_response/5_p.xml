<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Commenters also ascribed actions to collective society by using collective
language and terminology (e.g. &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;American public,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221;) to request and
encourage the public to take precautionary measures in response to the virus.
For example, one commenter encouraged the public to comply with the recommended
aggressive measures of social distancing as stated in their comment: &#8220;We all
have to concentrate on social distancing and hand washing&#8221;. In another example,
a commenter encouraged others to wear masks in public &#8220;Once more vaccines are
approved, things will change for the better. Until then, wear a real mask,
practice social distancing and the virus will have a tough time jumping around&#8221;.
Other comments ascribed actions on the <italic toggle="yes">Individual or Personal</italic>
level. This was evident from a group of comments expressing actions that will
and should be taken by commenters on the individual or family levels to minimize
the spread of the virus. After reviewing the models, some commenters, for
example, were &#8220;persuaded to lay low and not to visit their elderly parents over
spring break&#8221;. Others chose to take extra health precautions by &#8220;wearing a mask
and gloves and washing hands for a very long time&#8221;.</p>
