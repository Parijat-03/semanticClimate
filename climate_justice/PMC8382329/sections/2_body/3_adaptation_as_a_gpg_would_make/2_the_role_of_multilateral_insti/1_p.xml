Taking an institutionalist's perspective, we argue that it strongly matters whether new norms are first accepted and embedded in international institutions, since they are considered as &#8220;a force in global politics&#8221; (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>:16). So, as a follow-up to UNDP initiatives on GPGs of the last decades, the World Bank has commissioned the study <italic>Collective Solutions 2025</italic> as a collaborative platform, to understand, among other things, its role in GPG provision (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2012</xref>). Birdsall and MacDonald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>) propose to create a new arm of the World Bank to deal with climate change, but this proposal needs further scrutiny.</p>
