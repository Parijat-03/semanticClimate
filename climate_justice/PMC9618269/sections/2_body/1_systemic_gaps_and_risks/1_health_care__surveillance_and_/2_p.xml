Whilst the impact of climate change is felt in different ways across different regions, COVID-19 impacts bring to the fore, the potential complexity humans could face if they fail to find an agreement and solution to reversing climate change. In Nigeria, surveillance was heightened since January 2020. Despite that, the index case was imported into the country and was identified on the 27th of February. Here begins the story of the nation&#8217;s one systemic gap or vulnerability (effectiveness of the airport surveillance) that led to a series of challenges for the country. This can be likened to the slow pace of action across the country and globally towards reducing carbon footprint. The inability of Nigeria to take decisive preventive actions before the arrival of the index case typifies the lack of concerted actions being witnessed around the world in the seemingly lacklustre handling of climate change escalating conditions.</p>
