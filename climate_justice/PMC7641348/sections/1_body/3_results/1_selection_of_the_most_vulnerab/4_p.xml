<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All indices are relevant to extreme heat, but their different compositions lead to contrasting assessments of vulnerability. CES is an average of two overall components: pollution burden and population characteristics. Pollution burden is captured by the concepts Air Pollution and Land Based Pollution (<xref rid="pone.0240841.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which reflect twelve unique indicators for CES, such as presence of solid waste sites and facilities and pesticide use. An emphasis on pollution burden explains some of the dissimilarity between CES and the other indices. The median vulnerability index percentile values for tracts that have a pollution burden in the upper quartile are 84.3 for CES, 67.6 for HHAI, and 68.4 for SVI. Hence SVI and HHAI prioritize pollution less in classification of most vulnerable communities. Five out of sixteen of HHAI&#8217;s indicators pertain to the category Environmental Conditions and only two are pollution specific. SVI has no indicators in the Environmental Conditions or Health categories.</p>
