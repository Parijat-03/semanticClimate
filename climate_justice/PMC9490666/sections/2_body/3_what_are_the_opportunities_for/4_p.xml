We need to approach travel in a way that is mindful of the greenhouse gas emissions it generates while recognizing that travel can be essential to building global health partnerships and performing needed research.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In addition, many societies depend on in-person annual meetings for financial viability. We should prioritize virtual meetings and, when travel is necessary, opt for low-carbon means of transport (e.g., trains and electric vehicles as opposed to planes and vehicles with internal combustion engines). When flying is necessary, we can minimize emissions by flying direct, choosing economy class, and bundling meetings to reduce the frequency of flying. Finally, it is possible to offset the greenhouse gas emissions generated from air travel by capturing and storing greenhouse gases that would not otherwise be captured&#8212;for example, through reforestation. Online tools exist that calculate the amount of carbon dioxide equivalents emitted from a given flight and the number of trees needed to absorb the same amount. However, it takes approximately 20 years of tree growth to absorb the emissions.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
