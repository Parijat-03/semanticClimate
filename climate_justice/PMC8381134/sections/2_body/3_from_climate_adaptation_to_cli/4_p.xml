Multiple scholars have noted the exploitative relationships that exist between normative climate change science and scientists and local/indigenous knowledge and practitioners (Ford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Klenk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>; Ojha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). This unequal power dynamic is evident in scholarship that overwhelmingly &#8220;takes&#8221; local/indigenous knowledge, severs it from its socio-historical context, and inserts it within analytical and evaluation methodologies that contradict its cosmological characteristics. For Dawa and other members of his community, the lack of representation throughout the research process resembles the marginalization they face in governmentalized state spaces. The relationships they share with the state and the science begin to merge when the subjects representing each entity, intentionally or otherwise, marginalize them. Co-production of knowledge creates an alternative to this model by focusing on the politics of framing, advocating a plurality of assessment pathways, and embracing the massive uncertainty within climate-society relationships. This allows for the inclusion of not just material aspirations of the community but also the voices of more-than-human and more-than-material beings and processes through their intertwined stories (Gergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>).</p>
