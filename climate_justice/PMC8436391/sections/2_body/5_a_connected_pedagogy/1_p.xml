<p>We recognize the solidarity that emerges from in the &#8216;connectedness&#8217; of the
local and global, and our pedagogy aims to foster student perspectives on local and global
issues with an approach that is connected and adaptive. We support students to be more
&#8216;connected to the world&#8217; and each other as learners and emerging professionals.
Here, we link with existing scholarship that positions social work at the nexus of the local and
global to expand opportunities for a connected form of practice. We seek to enable students to
engage with civil society actors (individuals, groups, communities and organizations) and
develop policy responses for social change across local, state, regional and international
borders.</p>
