<italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;m going to</italic> (ranked #4) and <italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;m trying to</italic> (#9) raise the themes of effort, intentions, and aspirations, often involving a struggle or frustration, especially in the case of <italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;m trying to</italic> (Examples 23&#8211;26). In combination with <italic toggle="yes">I don&#8217;t have</italic> (#5) and <italic toggle="yes">I don&#8217;t want</italic> (#8), we receive the overall impression that consumers of plastic do not feel adequately equipped to live as ecologically as they would like (Examples 27 and 28), or find the prospect of the more ecological options available to them unattractive or unreasonable (Examples 29 and 30).</p>
