<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0370">Terrestrial vegetation systems, particularly forests, stand at the crossroads between the three critical bioeconomy pathways of utilizing more biomaterials, better use of bioenergy, and securing ecosystem services, notably including terrestrial carbon sequestration. This presents risks and opportunities. Necessarily, harvesting in forests to meet demands for biomass must not be a driver for deforestation and must not exceed those forests' capacity to grow more biomass and so renew the losses. Sustainable forest management (SFM) also recognizes requirements to maintain soil and water quality, conserve biodiversity, protect habitats, and respect for local/indigenous communities. However, even meeting the highest SFM standards cannot necessarily address all the goals of bioeconomy development. An increased intensity of harvesting in forests can negatively impact forest carbon stocks and sequestration, effects which may be temporary or may last for centuries, depending on the specific circumstances (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Camia et al., 2021</xref>). As part of optimizing forest management, such negative impacts need to be avoided or their consequences minimized or rapidly ameliorated. Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Verkerk et al., 2020</xref>) places the aim of increasing wood supply alongside adapting forest ecosystems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change risks and the overall aim of reducing GHG emissions. The potential of CSF has been demonstrated in a few case study areas in Europe. Still, much more work would be needed to embed CSF into everyday forestry planning and practice across a wide range of forest ecosystems and national or regional circumstances.</p>
