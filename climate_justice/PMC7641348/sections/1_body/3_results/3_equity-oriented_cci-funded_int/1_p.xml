<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To date California has directed most of the heat-related CCI-funded investments to its most vulnerable communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This analysis considers 56,125 CCI-funded tract interventions. Under our search criteria, we identify 2,503 of those as unique heat-related adaptations across four project categories: heat, greening and surfaces, outdoor workers, and weatherization. 323 tract interventions are duplicates across these categories. Across all heat-related project categories considered, 73.4% of tract interventions went to communities with a compound vulnerability score of two or three. In comparison, as indicated by the red line, 37.6% of tracts in the state are considered vulnerable under at least one index. 4.5%, 7.8%, and 7.3% of tract interventions went to communities not considered vulnerable under any index for the heat, greening and surfaces, and weatherization categories, respectively. For all CCI-funded tract interventions (far-right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), the allocation of interventions across tracts with varying compound vulnerability scores closely matches the distribution of tracts with those scores across the state.</p>
