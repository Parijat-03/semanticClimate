      <td>Planting bioenergy crops, like perennial grasses, on\ndegraded land can increase soil carbon and ecosystem\nquality (including biodiversity), thereby helping to preserve\nsoil quality, reverse land degradation, prevent desertification\nprocesses, and reduce food insecurity. These effects depend\non the scale of deployment, the feedstock, the prior land\nuse, and which other response options are included (see\nSection 6.4.4.2). Large-scale production of bioenergy can\nrequire significant amounts of land, increasing potential\npressures for land conversion and land degradation. Low\nlevels of bioenergy deployment require less land, leading\nto smaller effects on forest cover and food prices; however,\nthese land requirements could still be substantial. In terms\nof feedstocks, in some regions, they may not need irrigation,\nand thus would not compete for water with food crops.\nAdditionally, the use of residues or microalgae could limit\ncompetition for land and biodiversity loss; however, residues\ncould result in land degradation or decreased soil organic\ncarbon. Whether woody bioenergy results in increased\ncompetition for land or not is disputed in the literature,\nwith some studies suggesting reduced competition and\nothers suggesting enhanced competition. One study noted\nthat this effect changes over time, with complementarity\nbetween woody bioenergy and forest carbon sequestration\nin the near-term, but increased competition for land with\nafforestation/reforestation in the long term. Additionally,\nwoody bioenergy could also result in land degradation.</td>
