Many unions have resisted the temptation to move toward members only representation, however, for several reasons. Representation of a nonmember in a grievance proceeding may convince the individual of the value of the union, turning a nonmember into a supporter. In addition, the union loses the ability to exert some control over the interpretation of the contract when individuals can represent themselves in the grievance and arbitration process (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1843&#8211;44). The resulting decision may harm other workers (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1843&#8211;44). Further, evidence does not suggest that allowing unions to charge nonmembers for representation in the grievance process increases membership in the union in most cases, although it may conserve existing union resources for the use of members (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1840&#8211;42). The absence of exclusive representation can weaken the union as well, enabling the use of divide and conquer tactics by employers and union opponents (Brooks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). And some labor advocates fear that ending exclusive representation and the accompanying duty of fair representation might enable discrimination (Bronfenbrenner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>).</p>
