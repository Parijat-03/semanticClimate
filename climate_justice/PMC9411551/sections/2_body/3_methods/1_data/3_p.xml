Each of these climate change-attribution studies used different modeling techniques to model how climate change increased precipitation but all align in tracing how the storm&#8217;s rainfall differed from historical averages due to biophysical changes; especially the increased moisture content of the air and increased temperature of the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the storm. The full hydrological model used to construct the data built on these scenarios we utilize here is described in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
