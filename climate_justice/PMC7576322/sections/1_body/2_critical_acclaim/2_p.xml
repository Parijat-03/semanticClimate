<italic>Rising</italic> has been critically acclaimed, with numerous book reviews published including in <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Biello, 2018</xref>), and was a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. The book also appears on the list of recommended books for teaching climate justice by the Zinn Education Project. In reviewing this book through a social studies lens, I hope to help K-12 social studies educators see how the stories found in Rising can be used in classes as a way to investigate the social cost (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Coase, 1960</xref>) of climate change, climate justice, and finding equitable solutions to climate change.</p>
