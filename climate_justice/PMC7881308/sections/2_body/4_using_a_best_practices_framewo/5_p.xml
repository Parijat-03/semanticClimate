It is a credit to the supervisors that they adapted their processes to ensure clients continued to receive appropriate services and that students remained engaged with a range of meaningful activities. The time required for supervisors to prepare and conduct client interviews increased and both supervisors and students engaged in new approaches to completing file-related following-up work. Students were often assigned to complete client work in pairs and engaged in group debriefs with their supervisor.</p>
