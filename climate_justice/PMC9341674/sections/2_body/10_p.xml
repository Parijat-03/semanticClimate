<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In Europe, the legal framework for diverse participation in the development of environmental and climate policies already exists. In 2014, the Economic Commission for Europe issued comprehensive recommendations under the Aarhus Convention on promoting effective public participation in decision-making in environmental matters. Let us now measure the inclusion of public health experts and representatives of indigenous communities and children in government national roundtables and official delegations to UN climate events&#8212;such as at COP27&#8212;the Conferences of Parties meeting in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt in November 2022. Bridges between the public health, environmental and legal communities and advocates must be strengthened if we are to &#8216;keep 1.5 alive&#8217;.</p>
