Similarly, indigenous concepts such as <italic>vanua</italic> in Fiji or <italic>Fa&#8217;afaletui</italic> in Samoa (and those that are similar across all the Pacific Islands) highlight the deep connection between land and sea, place, and identity, and these are reflected in the way Pacific Islanders understand and experience the mosaic of experienced and anticipated NELD. These interconnections need to be integrated into the way NELD is also addressed. It is encouraging to see nations such as Vanuatu already linking priorities around climate change adaptation with diet-related non-communicable diseases and focusing on developing interconnected solutions to complex and wicked problems.</p>
