On the water, activists turned boats into tools of protest by blocking the passage of ships. By using their row boats to block the movement of big ships, many participants turned their vehicles into effective counter-symbols. Their goal was to disturb the flow of traffic, to delay the arrival of cruise ships by several hours, and thereby to interrupt the system in the same way that it interrupts the paces of the city&#8217;s inhabitants. Turning the water into a&#160;protest space, activists also drew attention to the fact that waterways are more than just transport routes. They are the streets of the residents and form an important part of the urban space in which people work, spend leisure time, and gather for important events. Regarding their relational dimension, Elizabeth Shove argues that infrastructures should not be perceived &#8220;as somehow fixed. Instead, something becomes an &#8216;infrastructure&#8217; when it stands in an infrastructural role in relation to one or more practices&#8221; (Baringhorst et&#160;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>: 77). This fluidity manifests itself in urban actions happening in multiple locations.</p>
