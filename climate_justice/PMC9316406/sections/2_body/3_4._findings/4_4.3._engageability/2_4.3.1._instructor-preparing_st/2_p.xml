GSW-specific education and training enable students to leverage the &#8220;service delivery&#8221; and &#8220;knowledge expertise&#8221; inventories of agencies to better identify areas that need improvement at the community level and to enhance the community&#8217;s pre-disaster preparedness. For instance, community-based pre-disaster preparedness has been slowly developing in Canada, providing social workers various opportunities to support disaster mitigation efforts. Social workers can facilitate agencies&#8217; community outreach activities to educate the general public and raise their disaster preparedness awareness. Social workers can help these agencies improve their disaster and emergency response planning (e.g., building organizational emergency response plans and providing agency-wide staff-specific disaster preparedness training). These efforts encourage cross-sector collaboration among agencies and professionals to be ready to serve local inhabitants when disasters hit.</p>
