Shifting the weights among the three dimensions or switching the interpretation used for each corner has a different influence on emission reduction targets depending on the country and interpretations assessed; a set of ternary charts illustrating the effects of changing all interpretations for all countries can be found in the Supplementary Information, section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, or can be generated via use of an interactive web tool developed for this framework (for details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/effort-sharing/">https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/effort-sharing/</ext-link>).</p>
