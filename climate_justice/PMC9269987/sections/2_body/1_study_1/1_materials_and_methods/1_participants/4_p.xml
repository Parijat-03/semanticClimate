<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As exclusion criteria, we consulted the relative speed index (RSI; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Leiner, 2019</xref>) and a social desirability score (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Satow, 2012</xref>). The RSI is computed by dividing the median page completion time of the sample by the page completion time of the respective individual. A relative speed index of 2 indicates that an individual was twice as fast as the median of the total respondents. According to the recommendation of <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Leiner (2019)</xref>, we removed 46 panelists with RSI &gt; 2 as we assumed them to not have worked conscientiously. Additionally, we excluded 12 participants due to socially desirable response tendencies as they scored 7 or higher on the social desirability scale (see Instruments; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Satow, 2012</xref>).</p>
