<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0320">In the last few decades, microfinance has univocally been designed as a public policy instrument for lifting people out of poverty and ensuring perduring development (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Antoh and Arhin, 2018</xref>). In this framework, financial inclusion has been foreseen as a key strategy to alleviate vulnerability and improve sustainability &#8211; above all socioeconomic factors (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Niaz, 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of government throughout the years has become more central. First and foremost, passing from MDGs to SDGs meant acknowledging the urgency of striving for global sustainable development goals (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gatto, 2020</xref>). From this moment onward, all countries were included in this process and measurements. It may be said that each country may be conceived as a sustainable developing country. Microfinance, FinTech, access to finance and resilience make no exception in this regard since countries have now clear operational mandates (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Arora and Singh, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015</xref>). The role of government in a multistakeholder effort to achieve financial inclusion in the framework of sustainable development targets cannot be neglected (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kara et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). That is another reason why the governance component within SDGs deserves a more central role.</p>
