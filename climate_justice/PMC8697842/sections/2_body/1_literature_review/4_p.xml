(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) analyzed the factors that affected waste generation in Australia for the period between 2007 and 2014. Using structural decomposition analysis (SDA), the researchers found that households&#8217; economic activity was responsible for the increase in waste generation. They also reported that the changes in the production mix of final demand reduced waste generation during the studied period. Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) concluded that the manufacturing sector has the highest waste generation intensity and requires special attention in terms of waste reduction.</p>
