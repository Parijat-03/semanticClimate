      <td>Mitigation: Moderate benefits by retaining soil carbon stocks that might otherwise be lost. Historical losses of soil\ncarbon have been in the order of 500 GtCO2 (Sanderman et al. 2017) (Table 6.13). Mean annual global cropland conver-\nsion rates (1961&#8211;2003) have been 0.36% per year (Krause et al. 2017), that is, around 47,000 km2 yr&#8211;1 &#8211; so preventing\nconversion could potentially save moderate emissions of CO2. Adaptation: No literature (Table 6.21). Desertification:\nLimited benefits by shifting from annual crops to permanent vegetation cover under grass in dry areas (Table 6.29)\n(Chapter 3). Land degradation: Limited benefits by shifting from annual crops to permanent vegetation cover under\ngrass (Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food security: Moderate negative impacts, since more land is required to produce\nhuman food from livestock products on grassland than from crops on cropland, meaning that a shift to grassland could\nreduce total productivity and threaten food security (Clark and Tilman 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).</td>
