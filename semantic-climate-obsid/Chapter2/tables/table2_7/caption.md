Table 2.7 Residual (gross) fossil fuel emissions (GtCO2) in climate change mitigation scenarios strengthening mitigation action after 2020 (“early strengthening”),
compared to scenarios that keep NDC ambition level until 2030 and only strengthen thereafter.

Cumulative gross CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry until reaching net zero CO2 emissions are given in terms of the mean as well as minimum and
maximum (in parentheses) across seven participating models: AIM/CGE, GCAM, IMAGE, MESSAGES, POLES, REMIND, WITCH. Scenario design prescribes a
harmonised, global carbon price in line with long-term carbon budget. Delay scenarios follow the same price trajectory, but 10 years later. Carbon dioxide
removal requirements represent ex-post calculations that subtract gross fossil fuel emissions from the carbon budget associated with the respective long-term
warming limit. We take the carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% probability and to 2°C with a 67% probability (Canadell et al., 2021). Hence,
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) requirements reflect a minimum amount of CDR for a given mitigation trajectory. Results are reported at 2 significant digits.
