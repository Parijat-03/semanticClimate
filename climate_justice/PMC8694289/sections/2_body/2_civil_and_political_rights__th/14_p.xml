Knox, noted the relevance of both &#8220;rights whose enjoyment is particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation&#8221; (substantive rights) and &#8220;rights whose exercise supports better environmental policymaking&#8221; (procedural rights). Knox cited as examples of procedural rights the rights to freedom of expression and association, to information, to participation in decision-making, and to effective remedies.<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These rights have also been explicitly recognized in regional environmental treaties in Europe and the Americas. In 1998, the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) was adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.<sup><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In 2005, the state parties to the Aarhus Convention adopted guidelines on promoting the application of the principles of the convention in international forums.<sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In 2014, the Economic Commission for Europe issued comprehensive recommendations under the Aarhus Convention on promoting effective public participation in decision-making in environmental matters.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In 2018, the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters was adopted in Escaz&#250;, Costa Rica, under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
