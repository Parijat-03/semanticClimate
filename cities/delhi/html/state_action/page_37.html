K. Dash, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi has analyzed the Changes in the surface air temperature, rainfall and their extreme events in the city of Delhi based on daily observed gridded (0.5&#176;&#215;0.5&#176;) datasets from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). In this study, IMD gridded rainfall and temperature during the period 1951-2010 and 1969-2005 respectively and simulations of global model NCAR_CCSM3 and regional model RegCM4.3 are used for projecting the future temperature and rainfall events. Daily surface air maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation values are averaged over different time scales to get respective mean values. Further, these daily parameters are used to analyse their respective extreme events. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="434.35" top="274.66"><span x0="72.02" y0="274.66" x1="434.35" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 274.66; y1: 286.66; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Regional Climate Model system RegCM &#8211; Fourth Version (REGCM4) </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.08" top="243.19"><span x0="72.02" y0="243.19" x1="508.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 243.19; y1: 255.19; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Regional Climate Model system RegCM, originally developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is maintained in the Earth System Physics (ESP) section of the ICTP. The first version of the model, RegCM1, was developed in 1989 and since then it has undergone major updates in 1993 (RegCM2), 1999 (RegCM2.5), 2006 (RegCM3) and most recently 2010 (RegCM4). The latest version of the model, RegCM4, is now fully supported by the ESP, while previous versions are no longer available. This version includes major upgrades in the structure of the code and its pre- and post- processors, along with the inclusion of some new physics parameterizations. The model is flexible, portable and easy to use. It can be applied to any region of the World, with grid spacing of up to about 10 km (hydrostatic limit), and for a wide range of studies, from process studies to paleoclimate and future climate simulation.  </span></div></body></html>
