A 2011 amendment to MARPOL created the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). Certain new vessels must be designed with suitable (increasing over time) increases in efficiency to meet the EEDI and all vessels must create and follow plans adhering to the SEEMP. The failure of this approach to reduce emissions suggests that the shipping industry is a case of the Jevons paradox, which states that the more efficient the use of a resource, the more is consumed in total, something first observed with the use of coal during the industrial revolution. Ships are becoming more efficient but total emissions continue to increase because we ship more goods (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The figure also shows that most of the efficiency gains came in the period 2008&#8211;2012, when shipping lines reduced speeds in order to burn less fuel hence lower costs during the overcapacity crisis. There is a limit to how far this technique can be utilised, hence the much lower gains since then.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Jevons paradox in global shipping: carbon intensity vs goods loaded, tonne miles and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 2000&#8211;2018.</p><p>Source: Author, based on data from UNCTAD and IMO, several years</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10551_2022_5256_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
