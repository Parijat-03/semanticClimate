Many low- and middle-income countries faced significant challenges in curtailing the spread of the disease, some of which included porous borders, the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, poverty, poor health literacy, infodemic, overcrowding, and weak health systems (Lucero-Prisno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Despite these challenges, African countries escaped most of the wrath of the disease; this could be attributed to African nations&#8217; long history of dealing with infectious diseases, younger populace implying fewer comorbidities, early shutdowns, and limited transportation networks. But the lessons from the pandemic must be learnt, as we might not be that lucky the next time. Furthermore, across the globe, the various effects were noticeable some of which include, an increase in cybercrime, the rampant spread of disinformation/misinformation, protests/civil unrest, overwhelmed public/private infrastructure, shortages of essential items, exposure to the frailty of lean manufacturing system (just-in-time), pressures on government revenue, increase in domestic violence, depression as well as negative impact on education, tourism, and other sectors of the economy. This level of impact and complexity serves as a reminder of how interrelated and vulnerable we are as a people to the effect of disasters and now, climate change.</p>
