The Pope&#8217;s encyclical was widely praised by the international climate community, partly because the Pope has moral authority and his voice can reach a wide range of people, including non-Christians. However, the most significant part of the Pope&#8217;s encyclical was that it framed climate change as a deeply moral issue rooted in our way of life and placed virtue and human dignity at the centre of climate discourse (Brulle and Antonio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>; Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Jamieson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; O&#8217;Riordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). In particular, Pope Francis challenged dominant neoliberal views on consumerism (Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>) and called for rethinking our &#8216;post-political attitude&#8217; of that &#8216;there is no alternative to continuing our current growth-oriented, consumerist market economy&#8217; (Brulle and Antonio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). Hulme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>) argued that the encyclical was not so much about climate change; it was an invitation to the spiritual searching of &#8216;what it means to be human&#8217; in an age of climate change.</p>
