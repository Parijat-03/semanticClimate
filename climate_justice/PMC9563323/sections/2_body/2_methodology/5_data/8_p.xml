Within Reddit, we located three suitable subreddits (&#8216;AskUK&#8217;, &#8216;CasualUK&#8217;, and &#8216;BritishProblems&#8217;) and then used the Reddit API<fn id="j_jwl-2022-0017_fn_010"><label>10</label><p>Via Joseph Lai&#8217;s &#8216;Universal Reddit Scraper&#8217; Python package, available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/JosephLai241/URS" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/JosephLai241/URS</ext-link>.</p></fn> to download threads from within those subreddits that met our search term criteria (see <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_app_001" ref-type="app">Appendix B</xref> for these terms), posted between January 2016 and March 2021. For Mumsnet, given that there is no API available and the website is more difficult to scrape, we used a combination of BootCat and Octoparse,<fn id="j_jwl-2022-0017_fn_011"><label>11</label><p>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.octoparse.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.octoparse.com/</ext-link> (accessed 6 May 2021).</p></fn> another freely available webpage scraper, to locate and download relevant threads that were posted within the same timeframe as those of Reddit. The BootCat tuples used to determine the Mumsnet threads are given in <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_app_001" ref-type="app">Appendix B</xref>. In all cases of social media and forum post scraping, only publicly available posts and comments were gathered for inclusion in the corpus, and all usernames were pseudonymized.</p>
