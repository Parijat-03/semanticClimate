When land management scenarios were added to the modelling, the erosion rates started to vary dramatically for all three time periods, ranging from a&#160;decrease of 100% for no-till land use, to an increase of 3621% for row crops under annual tillage and sub-days intensity changes (Mullan et al. 2012).

Climate change is projected to alter the conditions and hence impact on the spatial mosaic of vegetation, which can be considered a&#160;form of land degradation. Warren et al. (2018) estimated that only about 33% of globally important biodiversity conservation areas will remain intact if global mean temperature increases to&#160;4.5&#176;C, while twice that area (67%) will remain intact if warming is restricted to 2&#176;C. According to AR5, the clearest link between climate change and ecosystem change is when temperature is the primary driver, with changes of Arctic tundra as a&#160;response to signi&#64257;cant warming as the best example (Settele et al. 2015). Even though distinguishing climate-induced changes from land-use changes is challenging, Boit et al. (2016) suggest that&#160;5&#8211;6% of biomes in South America will undergo biome shifts until 2100, regardless of scenario, attributed to climate change. The projected biome shifts are primarily forests shifting to shrubland and dry forests becoming fragmented and isolated from more humid forests (Boit et al. 2016). Boreal forests are subject to unprecedented warming in terms of speed and amplitude (IPCC 2013b), with signi&#64257;cant impacts on their regional distribution (Juday et al. 2015). Globally, tree lines are generally expanding northward and to higher elevations, or remaining stable, while a&#160;reduction in tree lines was rarely observed, and only where disturbances occurred (Harsch et al. 2009).
