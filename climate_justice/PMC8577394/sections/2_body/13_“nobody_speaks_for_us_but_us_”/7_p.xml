For representatives of public housing, the city&#8217;s plan constituted an essential form of protection against flooding for the &#8220;black and brown&#8221; &#8220;frontlines,&#8221; and as described above, they contended that white residents in market housing had no authority to speak for them. City officials also highlighted the climate justice dimensions of the plan, arguing that they had prioritized the neighborhood for protection due to its high concentration of public housing where the majority of residents are people of color. Yet from the point of view of activists, city officials tactically used the issue of race to divide and conquer the neighborhood and push the plan through. Activists steadfastly maintained that their groups represented the whole community, including people of all races and ethnicities in the LES. When I asked activists about race, they resisted insinuations that older white residents formed the majority of participants in advocacy groups and highlighted the occasions when Latin American or Black residents had participated protests or events.</p>
