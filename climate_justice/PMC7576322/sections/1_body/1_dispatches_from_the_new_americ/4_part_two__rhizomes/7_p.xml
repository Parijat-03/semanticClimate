While these plans to relocate whole communities offer a glimpse into the future for residents of vulnerable regions, it is clear that these solutions present a different kind of loss, one that isn&#8217;t easily quantifiable. The idea that whole communities need to be relocated is an extreme measure, which should only be taken in the direst of circumstances. Yet, while reading this book, it becomes clear that those dire circumstances are already here for some, and they are spreading to other communities throughout the country.</p>
