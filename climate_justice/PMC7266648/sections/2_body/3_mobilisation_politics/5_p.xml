Overall, social movement citizenship, or everyday making, presents challenges to an outcome-focused democratic analysis due to a tendency towards adhocracy, paradoxical disconnection and rapid demobilisation by political participants following their &#8220;hit-and-run&#8221; engagement. Each is discussed in turn.</p>
