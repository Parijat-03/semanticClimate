Consider the Parque Explora in Medellin, Colombia (Aguirre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>). Through different initiatives, this museum has looked to engage low-income communities that are geographically located nearby. The museum offers admission subsidies for low income and school groups, promotes youth hubs for research, and fosters community projects. One remarkable effort of Parque Explora is the <italic>Expanded territory&#8212;Lab of neighbourhood practices</italic> project. This initiative seeks to &#8220;articulate communities based on social appropriation of knowledge, exchange of knowledge, reflection about the local and collaborative work, for the development of leadership capacities, research and communication of the youth of [&#8230;] Medellin&#8221; (Parque Explora, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">n.d.</xref>). Framed around topics such as biodiversity and creative electronics, these projects depart from the community interests and the social dynamics of their territories and look to generate collaborative solutions for local problems (Parque Explora, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">n.d.</xref>).</p>
