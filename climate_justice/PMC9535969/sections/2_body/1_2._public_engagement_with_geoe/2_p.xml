In 2018, there were only &#8216;around 30 empirical social science studies on public perceptions of climate engineering&#8217; (<xref rid="bibr7-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Buck, 2018</xref>: 79). Although the large majority treats geoengineering as a &#8216;global object&#8217;, instead of focussing on a specific technique (<xref rid="bibr7-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Buck, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2017</xref>), some exercises have delved into specific applications. <xref rid="bibr12-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Corner et al.
