The annual mean surface air temperature may significantly increase at Delhi. The projection of extreme temperature events indicates an increase in warm events (T90p, T95p and T99p) and decrease in cold events (T10p, T05p and T01p) in Delhi without any statistical significance. Based on CCSM3 simulations, the heavy rainfall event may increase in Delhi but without any be significance. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.15" top="513.0"><span x0="72.02" y0="513.0" x1="508.15" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 513.0; y1: 525.0; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">RegCM4.3 projects a robust increase in annual minimum temperature significant at 1% level during 2015-2044. Further, there is robust projection of decrease in cold days and nights in Delhi. Based on CCSM3 simulations there is a projected significance increase in the annual mean temperature at Delhi. Hence, it is a robust sign of future change. CCSM3 also projects somewhat robust increase in the monsoon precipitation at Delhi in the near future since JJAS precipitation may significantly increase at 10% level. Similarly, there is a somewhat robust increase in heavy rainfall event in Delhi.</span></div><div left="72.02" right="186.74" top="383.74"><span x0="72.02" y0="383.74" x1="186.74" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 383.74; y1: 395.74; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">4.5Future Studies </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.26" top="356.14"><span x0="72.02" y0="356.14" x1="508.26" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 356.14; y1: 368.14; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">It was recognized that there are important science issues that need to be addressed, and also that the present efforts by GNCTD to deal need more inter and intra departmental integration and networking. There aren&#8217;t many hazard risk mapping and climate modelling analysis studies available for Delhi. A further in-depth detailed study for extreme climate events especially in terms of rainfall, temperature and wind extremes by the use of dynamic high resolution regional climate modelling is advised. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.06" top="248.83"><span x0="72.02" y0="248.83" x1="508.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 248.83; y1: 260.83; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Future research priorities should include research to support policy improvement, and in particular implementation, evaluation, linkages between policies and consideration of the effects on ecosystems. Research organisations and networks may be best placed to take the initiative on these issues, and in particular to communicate research information to policymakers in appropriate ways. Research priorities also include support for governance, particularly addressing the mismatch between eco-system health, environmental flows and the water demands of various sectors in an integrated manner. Within this, a series of components should also be suggested for addressing technical, environmental and social issues as well as support in negotiation and community participation. </span></div><div left="201.53" right="396.67" top="725.52"><span x0="201.53" y0="725.52" x1="396.67" style="x0: 201.53; x1: 208.89; y0: 725.52; y1: 736.56; width: 7.36; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Categories of Rainfall events City (Delhi) </span></div><div left="223.61" right="310.13" top="709.32"><span x0="223.61" y0="709.32" x1="310.13" style="x0: 223.61; x1: 227.9; y0: 709.32; y1: 720.36; width: 4.29; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">JJAS mean rainfall </span><span x0="360.79" y0="708.32" x1="373.48" style="x0: 360.79; x1: 373.48; y0: 708.32; y1: 721.28; width: 12.69; font-size: 12.96; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings 3;">&#61554;</span><span x0="255.41" y0="693.0" x1="371.71" style="x0: 255.41; x1: 262.16; y0: 693.0; y1: 704.04; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Low - Moderate + Heavy + </span></div></body></html>
