Half of the studies were published since 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] or were still undergoing peer review at the time of writing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This indicates that academia is just beginning to study SBTs and data for empirical analysis is just beginning to emerge. The studies employ a variety of methods, such as statistical analyses informed by theories of corporate climate behavior (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]), case studies of selected companies (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]), and reviews of SBT methods or SBTi guidelines (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]), with many studies employing a mix of methods. Some studies focus on companies in specific regions (Europe, Asia, the UK, and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]), or sectors (construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]), while most have a global scope. Some studies address SBTs as an element of a broader inquiry (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]), but we focus on their SBT content here. A summary of each of the seventeen studies is provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. While our review focuses on these seventeen studies, we also draw on other literature when helpful in understanding SBT methods and practices.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of the seventeen reviewed studies chronologically ordered.
