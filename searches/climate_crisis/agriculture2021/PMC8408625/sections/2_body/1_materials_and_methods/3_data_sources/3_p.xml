The NUTS 3 classification represents small regions with a population ranging from 150,000 to 800,000 and is part of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) classification system, used to divide economic territories of the EU into three hierarchical sub categories for the purpose of data collection and statistical analysis (see <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> for further information).</p>
