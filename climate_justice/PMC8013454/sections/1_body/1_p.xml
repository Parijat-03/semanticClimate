For many activists, especially young people, involvement with climate change&#8208;related protest groups marks a sort of political coming&#8208;of&#8208;age. How do they learn political practice and citizenship? What examples and idols do they refer to? Studying novel climate action networks and their members and practices provides insights into contemporary forms of politicisation and the constitution of environmental subjectivities (Agrawal <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Callison <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Carefully weaving appealing graphic design and egalitarian language into their political messages, climate activists further constitute aesthetic systems (Sartwell <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Werbner <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Meyer <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) whose public acts are intricately planned performances of disruption. What systems of meaning and subjectivities are created in the context of these performances and what are their affective scaffoldings (Dave <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>)? Since public actions are planned as non&#8208;violent interventions, the movements challenge power structures by staging and publicly brandishing scientific knowledge. What is the role of science in acts of civil disobedience? Lastly, protests claim and intervene in urban spaces, making disruption and deceleration felt, and enacting an alternative way of life (Wetzel <xref rid="soca13005-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). How do urban publics respond to and shape these infrastructural disruptions?</p>
