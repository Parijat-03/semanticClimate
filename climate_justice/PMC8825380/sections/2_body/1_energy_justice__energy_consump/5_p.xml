Chiefly, there is no agreement on whether energy justice should be assessed with regard to total primary energy <italic>demand</italic> per capita or total primary energy <italic>footprint</italic> per capita (Arto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). Measuring only domestic energy demand may limit the accuracy of how much energy that is consumed, and its impacts. Measuring the energy footprint reveals a higher consumption of GJ per capita relative to HDI than domestic energy demand does (Arto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>: 9). Energy footprints include consumption patterns and energy embedded in products produced in nations other than where they are consumed.</p>
