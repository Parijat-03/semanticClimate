<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0019">There is some documentation of the compounding effects of the social determinants of health in exacerbating outcomes driven by both HIV and climate change, thereby disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> . The vulnerability of indigent groups and marginalized sectors to both HIV/AIDs and climate change emanate from inadequate adaptive capacity to respond to environmental and socioeconomic shocks, manifested in the lack of social, financial, and/or physical assets <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Gendered disparities are also observed both in HIV/AIDS outcomes and climate-related effects. Women and other sexual minorities in climate-vulnerable locations are disproportionately affected, especially in settings where socially-constructed gender roles determine responsibilities, access to resources, and motivations for risky sexual behaviors such as transactional sex <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. There is also evidence suggesting that the negative effects of climate change on PLHIVs may also go the other way &#8211; poorer health translates to greater dependence on natural resources and ecosystem services, which in turn decreases the capacity of ecosystems to deliver more benefits to people <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This is an example of a negative feedback loop that can worsen both HIV/AIDS- and environment-related outcomes in the long run. Because of the unequal distribution of health outcomes in society as they relate to both HIV/AIDS and climate change, tackling this nexus must take into account the myriad social determinants and their vast interconnections.</p>
