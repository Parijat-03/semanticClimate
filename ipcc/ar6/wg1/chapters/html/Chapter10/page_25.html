Different versions of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) products were found to perform differently over mountainous areas (Zulkafli et&#160;al., 2014). Orographic heavy rainfall associated with Typhoon Morakot in 2009 was severely underestimated in all microwave products including TRMM 3B42 (Shige et&#160;al., 2013). The underestimation has been mitigated in the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product by considering the orographic effects (Shige et&#160;al., 2013). Studies have suggested a&#160;high accuracy of passive optical satellite (e.g.,&#160;MODIS, Landsat) snow products under clear skies when compared with the field observations. However, cloud masking and sub-pixel cloud heterogeneity in these snow-cover products considerably restrict their applications (Kahn et&#160;al., 2011; Brun et&#160;al., 2015; Tang et&#160;al., 2017; Stillinger et&#160;al., 2019). Gridded datasets (e.g.,&#160;CRU, GPCC Full Data Product, GPCC Monitoring Product, ERA-Interim, ERA5, ERA5-land, MERRA-2, MERRA-2 bias adjusted, PERSIANN-CDR) are of paramount importance, yet they often lack enough in situ observations to improve the temporal and spatial distribution of meteorological parameters over complex mountain terrain (Zandler et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="179.13" top="426.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="426.48" x1="179.13" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 426.48; y1: 436.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.6 Structural Uncertainty</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="402.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="402.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Beyond climate monitoring, the quality and availability of multiple observational reference datasets play a&#160;central role in model evaluation. In fact, when using observations for model evaluation, there are multiple examples where inter-observational uncertainty is as large as the inter-model variability. This has been shown for various aspects of the Indian monsoon (Section&#160;10.6.3; Collins et&#160;al., 2013a) and for precipitation uncertainties over Africa (Section&#160;10.6.4; Nikulin et&#160;al., 2012; Sylla et&#160;al., 2013; Dosio et&#160;al., 2015; Bador et&#160;al., 2020) and Europe (Prein and Gobiet, 2017). Kotlarski et&#160;al. (2019) compared three high-resolution observational temperature and precipitation datasets (E-OBS, a&#160;compilation of national/regional high-resolution gridded datasets, and the EURO4M-MESAN 0.22&#176; reanalysis based on a&#160;high-resolution limited-area model) with five EURO-CORDEX RCMs driven by ERA-Interim. Generally, the differences between RCMs are larger than those between observation datasets, but for individual regions and performance metrics, observational uncertainty can dominate. They also showed that the choice of reference dataset can have an influence on the RCM performance score. Over the high mountain Asia region and East Asia, differences among gridded precipitation datasets can generate significant uncertainties in deriving precipitation characteristics (J. Kim et&#160;al., 2015; Kim and Park, 2016; Guo et&#160;al., 2017). Over western North America, observational uncertainty induces differences in multi-decadal precipitation trends (Lehner et&#160;al., 2018). Taking a&#160;very different perspective, the agreement between model simulations may be used to estimate the&#160;uncertainty and quality of observations (Massonnet et&#160;al., 2016).

They all require observational data for calibration as well as evaluation (Section&#160;10.3.3.1). Typically, the so-called perfect prognosis methods use quasi-observations for the predictors (i.e.,&#160;reanalyses) and actual observations for the predictands (the surface variables of interest). By contrast, bias adjustment methods use observations only for the predictands. Weather generators typically require only observed predictands, although some are conditioned on observed predictors as well. Very often these methods are based on&#160;daily data, because of user needs, but also because of the limited availability of sub-daily observations and the limited ability of climate models to realistically simulate sub-daily weather (Iizumi et&#160;al., 2012). Some methods are calibrated on the monthly scale, but some of the generated time series are then further disaggregated to the daily scale (e.g.,&#160;Thober et&#160;al., 2014). A&#160;few methods, mainly weather generators, represent sub-daily weather (Mezghani and Hingray, 2009; Kaczmarska et&#160;al., 2014). Many methods simulate temperature and precipitation only, although some also represent wind, radiation and other variables. The limited availability of high quality and long observational records typically restricts these applications to a&#160;few cases (Verfaillie et&#160;al., 2017; Pryor and Hahmann, 2019).

High quality and long observational data series are particularly relevant to quantify uncertainties. Different reanalyses present significant discrepancies when used as key predictor variables at the daily scale and may even affect the downscaled climate change signal (Brands et&#160;al., 2012; Dayon et&#160;al., 2015; Manzanas et&#160;al., 2015; Horton and Br&#246;nnimann, 2019).

Ideally, bias adjustment is calibrated against area-averaged data of the same spatial scale as the climate model output. Hence, high-quality observed gridded datasets with an effective resolution close to the nominal model resolution are required. Driven by the need to also generate regional-scale information in station-sparse regions, researchers have considered derived datasets that blend in situ and remote-sensing data to produce high-resolution observations to be used as predictands (Sections 10.2.1.2 and&#160;10.2.2.4; Haiden et&#160;al., 2011; Wilby and Yu, 2013).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="532.45" top="90.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="90.48" x1="532.45" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 90.48; y1: 100.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.3.2 Observation for Paleoclimate Data Assimilation</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="66.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="66.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.26; y0: 66.6; y1: 76.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Following some early concept studies, the first practical applications of paleoclimate data assimilation over past centuries used only selected </span></div></body></html>
