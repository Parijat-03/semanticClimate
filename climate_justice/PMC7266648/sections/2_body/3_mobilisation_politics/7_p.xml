Bouvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) equates this to reduced personal ownership of claims made online, due to anonymity, and the collapse of the existence of a shared symbolic order (the &#8220;big other&#8221;). New media, in undermining the cultural dominance of mass political media, has played an essential part in this process. As a type of networked politics, horizontal visibility can be low. One of the difficulties of the study of younger people&#8217;s political engagement lies in its comparative &#8220;invisibility&#8221; within social media that is not readily observable to wider publics. As Schuster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>) observed, this invisibility can create a &#8220;generational divide&#8221; within movements, with older activists unaware of the depth of engagement of younger activists. This reinforces findings that social networks may not create social capital as anticipated (Valenzuela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>). Indeed, there are concerns that high levels of social media consumption may be alienating (Hunt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>).</p>
