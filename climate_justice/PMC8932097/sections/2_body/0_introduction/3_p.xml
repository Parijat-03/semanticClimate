To do this, we had to overcome a number of substantive methodological challenges with regards to both data analysis and data. First, the relationship between climate and food security evolves and changes over time, and so a time constant regression framework, as is commonly used in the existing literature on climate and socioeconomic outcomes, is insufficient. We therefore use a time-varying regression, which can be tricky to operationalise and computationally intensive. Second, until recently, standardised data on food insecurity for a sufficient number of countries has been hard to access. In this paper, we sourced and merged data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 83 countries. Third, we had to define an appropriate measure of climate change. We chose to focus on temperature anomaly, defined as the annual deviation from a long-term rolling mean. Based on this approach, and controlling for other key factors that have been demonstrated to affect food insecurity, including extreme events, specifically droughts; and &#8220;development&#8221;, as proxied by sub-national HDI (the UNDP Human Development Index, disaggregated to the sub-national level); we are able to quantify the extent to which food security has already been negatively affected by climate change.</p>
