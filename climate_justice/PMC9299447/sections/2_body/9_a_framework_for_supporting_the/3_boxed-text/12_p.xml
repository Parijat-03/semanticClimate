<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We need communication about climate change to be clear. Give us the science, not a fancy Paris Agreement name and weird statistics. Too often people think we need to be protected from the information &#8211; when what we need is protection from dangerous climate change. We know it is complicated, but we need clarity, transparency, and reality. We want to know what is going on, not political speak. We also need leaders to show us what they are going to do and how they are going to do it, and to be accountable. We need politicians to acknowledge that we are in a crisis and validate how we see the world. We need to see a solid plan to tackle climate change. Politicians say that we are on our way to meeting and beating our Paris commitments. This shifts the focus from solving climate change to only achieving the Paris Agreement, which is not on track with the science.</p>
