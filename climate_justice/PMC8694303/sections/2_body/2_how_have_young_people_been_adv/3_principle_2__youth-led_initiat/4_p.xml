<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Young people face many challenges in ensuring equality and nondiscrimination while addressing climate change, especially in terms of achieving intergenerational equality in policies and investment decisions. Some of them might not be immediately obvious or evident. For example, policy makers and financial institutions often use high social discount rates when designing climate change policies and financial investments. Social discount rates are used to &#8220;calculate how much guarding against future carbon emissions is worth to us now.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> While the use of social discounting is not intended to treat one population group differently from another, when high social discount rates are used in cost-benefit analyses to inform policy decisions, short-term economic benefits for the current generation are prioritized over longterm benefits for future generations.<sup><xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> This impedes intergenerational climate justice, leads to policy inaction, and limits investment in innovative mitigation and adaptation projects. Another barrier that many young people face is accessing internet due to a lack of funding, technology, and infrastructure. For instance, two-thirds of people under the age of 25 do not have access to the internet at home.<sup><xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Moreover, many young people also face challenges in traveling, due to high prices and visa restrictions, to participate in global and national events. Overall, this limits the opportunities of many young people, especially those in LMICs, to participate equally in climate change events and to access accountability mechanisms and information.</p>
