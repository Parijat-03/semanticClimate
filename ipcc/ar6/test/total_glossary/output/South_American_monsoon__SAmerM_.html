Associated with this regime, an upper-tropospheric anticyclone (a.k.a. the Bolivian High) forms over the Altiplano region during the monsoon onset. The SAmerM then retreats during March&#8211;April&#8211;May with a northeastward migration of the convection. Further details on how SAmerM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p></div><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Global monsoon" data-phraseid="4690"><a href="#global_monsoon">Global monsoon</a></span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>
