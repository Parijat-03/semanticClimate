The COVID-19 crisis has affected several energy markets, including coal, natural gas, and renewable energy, but its impact on the oil market has been severe. This was most apparent in China because it accounted for 80% of the world's energy demand growth in 2019.<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> The EIA estimates that COVID-19 will reduce the demand for oil and other liquid fuels in China by an average of 190,000 barrels per day. China bought about 200,000 barrels of oil per day from the United States, while US oil exports were 8.5 million barrels per day. A few weeks after the outbreak in China, oil consumption fell by 20%, impacting a considerable number of oil companies. Fifty million people in China's Hubei Province no longer consume oil. The corresponding drop in oil prices will reduce the profits of producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq by 10%.<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref>
