<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The SIMCA model has been replicated in various sociopolitical contexts and adapted to the field of the climate justice movement (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Bamberg, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barth et al., 2015</xref>), as climate justice activists from the Global North in most cases do not engage as a result of personally experienced grievances or disadvantages. They rather act as privileged individuals in solidarity with those who are first and most affected by the climate crisis. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barth et al. (2015)</xref> extend the SIMCA model to include the predictors of violated moral beliefs and a global identity. Moral beliefs refer to moral issues that are perceived as universal, objective, and unchanging (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2011</xref>). Their violation motivates the attempt to restore conditions corresponding to those moral beliefs (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Zaal et al., 2011</xref>) and enables the emergence of opinion-based groups. This means that shared opinion or at least belief in shared opinion about violated moral value standards is considered a criterion for collective action, resulting in the formation of an opinion-based group (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bliuc et al., 2007</xref>). Global identity means identification with all people of the globe regardless of nationality, appearance, or other criteria, in the sense of &#8220;identification with all humanity&#8221; (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">McFarland et al., 2013</xref>), which is considered in the literature as a direct precursor of global solidarity (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Suba&#353;i&#263; et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
