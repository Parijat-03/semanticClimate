Thus, Katzfey et al. (2016) bias corrected the GCM SST 2 before using it for downscaling. Van Khiem et al. (2014) however showed a slight warm bias of simulated 3 temperature over some subregions of Vietnam. Temperature was shown to be strongly influenced by the 4 choice of cumulus scheme (Cruz et al., 2017). The biases for precipitation were found to be greater and less 5 systematic with wet or dry biases depending on the subregions (Manomaiphiboon et al., 2013; Kwan et al., 6 2014; Van Khiem et al., 2014; Juneng et al., 2016). Systematic wet biases were found in model simulations 7 in both DJF and JJA (Kwan et al., 2014; Van Khiem et al., 2014; Kirono et al., 2015; Juneng et al., 2016). 8 The wet biases over mainland Indochina could be linked to the lack of summer air-sea interactions in the 9 RCM experiments (Juneng et al., 2016). Regional climate models differ in simulating rainfall interannual 10 variability. Juneng et al. (2016) found stronger interannual variability of rainfall compared to observations 11 while Kirono et al. (2015) showed model underestimation of interannual variability. Simulated rainfall 12 amount is sensitive to the choice of convective scheme (Juneng et al., 2016; Ngo-Duc et al., 2017) and the 13 choice of land-surface scheme (Chung et al., 2018). Rainfall biases can be greatly reduced if a bias 14 correction method such as the quantile mapping is applied (Trinh-Tuan et al., 2018). 15 16 Extreme indices have been generally estimated using the core indices recommended by the joint WMO 17 Commission for Climatology (CCI)/World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and 18 Predictability (CLIVAR) project&#8217;s Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices 19 (ETCCDMI) (Manomaiphiboon et al., 2013; Ngo-Duc et al., 2014, 2017). There is better coherence for 20 temperature extreme indices than for precipitation extreme indices. Over Thailand, the occurrence frequency 21 of dry days is under-predicted (Manomaiphiboon et al., 2013). Climatic heavy rainfall centres can be well 22 captured (Kieu-Thi et al., 2016). The pattern of tropical cyclone numbers can be reasonable represented by 23 RCM outputs (Van Khiem et al., 2014; Kieu-Thi et al., 2016).  24 25 Multi-model experiments have been conducted (Cruz et al., 2017; Juneng et al., 2016; Katzfey et al., 2016; 26 Ngo-Duc et al., 2014, 2017; Raghavan et al., 2018a; Van Khiem et al., 2014). Ngo-Duc et al. (2014) showed 27 that the ensemble mean product tends to outperform the individual model in representing the climatological 28 mean state. By examining the similarity index omega (Koster et al., 2000, 2002) to assess how model 29 simulations agree or disagree in simulating historical climate for temperature and precipitation extreme 30 indices, Ngo-Duc et al. (2017) found that there are relatively high similarities among the simulations over 31 mainland Asia compared to those over the Maritime Continent for both seasonal and inter-annual variability. 32 (The similarity index quantifies the degree of similarity among ensemble members in terms of phase and 33 shape.) The extreme rainfall indices had a lower similarity index compared to that of temperature. Figure 34 Atlas.31: shows the similarity index omega for the CORDEX-SEA historical simulations for extreme indices 35 of temperature and rainfall. 36 37 38 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 292.07; y1: 303.05; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="292.07" x1="215.86">[START Figure Atlas.31: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="292.07" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 292.07; y1: 303.05; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">39 40 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 267.98; y1: 278.0; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="267.98" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.31: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="267.98" x1="516.75" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 133.19; y0: 267.98; y1: 278.0; width: 5.57; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Similarity index omega between the different CORDEX-SEA historical simulations for different </span><span x0="27.66" y0="267.77" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 267.77; y1: 278.75; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">41 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="256.52" x1="499.45" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 130.4; y0: 256.52; y1: 266.54; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">temperature-based (a-e) and precipitation extreme indices (f-h) (from Ngo-Duc et al., 2017). </span><span x0="27.66" y0="256.31" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 256.31; y1: 267.29; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">42 43 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 231.11; y1: 242.09; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="231.11" x1="205.17">[END Figure Atlas.31: HERE]  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="231.11" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 231.11; y1: 242.09; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">44 45 46 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 193.19; y1: 204.17; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="193.19" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.3.4.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="193.19" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 193.19; y1: 204.17; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">47 There has been limited published literature on future climate projections for Southeast Asia that are based on 48 multi-model regional climate simulations. Many of the previous works were country specific and were based 49 on either limited GCMs or RCMs or both. Ngo-Duc et al. (2014) used three RCMs for projecting future 50 climate in Vietnam and some extreme indices until the 2050s for the SRES A1B scenario. The temperature 51 trend was found to be positive and significant over the study area and may increase up to 1.8&#186;C in the boreal 52 summer (JJA). Loh et al. (2016) concluded that the projected temperature increments over Malaysia were 53 uniform, ranging from 2.7 to 4.2&#176;C and 1.7 to 3.1&#176;C for A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively.  54 55 </span></div></body></html>
