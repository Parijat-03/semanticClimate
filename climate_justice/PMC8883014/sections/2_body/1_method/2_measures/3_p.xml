<bold>Climate Activism</bold> was measured using an adapted version of the Environmental Actions Scale (Alisat &amp; Riemer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). This 18-item scale assesses how frequently participants engaged in a range of environmental actions including both participating in civic action (e.g., &#8220;Took part in a protest/rally about an environmental issue&#8221;), and leading civic action (e.g., &#8220;Organized a petition [including online petitions] for an environmental cause).&#8221; We adapted the scale such that participants responded in reference to the prior year (rather than the prior 6&#160;months) and were instructed to respond based on their behaviors prior to the COVID-19&#160;pandemic, since some forms of action were no longer possible at the time of data collection due to pandemic-related social distancing measures. Responses were reported using a Likert scale, with response options ranging from 0&#8201;=&#8201;Never to 4&#8201;=&#8201;Frequently. Mean scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating higher levels of engagement in climate activism. This scale has been used with college student populations internationally and has shown good reliability and validity (Alisat &amp; Riemer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). Reliability in the current sample was good (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.93).</p>
