Almost no studies verified that participants believed key facts about climate change (cf. [<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Without that, it is difficult to interpret the role of a factor like collective efficacy in relation to activism due to a potential for collider bias [<xref rid="RSOS210006C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]: e.g. a person might report high collective efficacy but not engage in climate activism because they do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, which can obscure the role of collective efficacy in a target population believing in climate change. Additionally, many of these studies only measured hypothetical intentions as their outcome variable [<xref rid="RSOS210006C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], rather than objective measures of behaviour. Self-reported pro-environmental behaviours only correlate about <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub>17</sub> = 0.46 with objective measures of the same behaviours [<xref rid="RSOS210006C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
