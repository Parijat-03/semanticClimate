Further, increased exposure to poor-quality air and green spaces often mirrors and compounds pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities. Evidence on the lifelong effects of air pollution on mental health outcomes such as depression continues to emerge.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Exposure to air pollution and traffic noise are similarly unequal for different neighbourhoods with regard to both socioeconomic status and ethnicity, with those least likely to own a car often most likely to live in traffic-clogged and polluted areas.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> At the same time, good access to urban nature can help to partially mitigate the harmful effects of socioeconomic inequalities.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
