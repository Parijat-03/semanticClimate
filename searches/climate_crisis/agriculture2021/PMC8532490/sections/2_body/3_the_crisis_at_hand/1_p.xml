The report finds that unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in human caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5&#160;&#176;C of warming averaged over the next 20&#160;years. Each of the last 4 decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850 (Masson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2021</xref>). These increases in temperature will bring about significant changes in water cycles, precipitation patterns, schedules and intensities, floods and seasonal snow covers, and accelerate permafrost thawing, glacier and icesheet melting, ocean warming and acidification, and overall sea level rise.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> The implications of these on food availability and nutrition are obvious.</p>
