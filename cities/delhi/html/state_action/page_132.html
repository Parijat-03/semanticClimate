The high death rate, infant mortality rate, sickness rate and poor standards of health are in fact largely due to neglect of environmental sanitation. Improvement of environment is therefore crucial for the prevention of disease and promotion of health of individuals and communities. All the above mentioned environmental factors greatly affect the human health directly or indirectly. Therefore, the first step in any health programme is the elimination of major public health risks through environmental control of those factors which are harmful to health. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.0" top="574.44"><span x0="72.02" y0="574.44" x1="526.0" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 574.44; y1: 586.44; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Climate change also brings new challenges to the control of infectious diseases. Many of the major killers are highly climate sensitive as regards temperature and rainfall, including cholera and the diarrhea diseases, as well as diseases including malaria, dengue and other infections carried by vectors. In sum, climate change threatens to slow, halt or reverses the progress that the global public health community is now making against many of these diseases. Environmental health is a key discipline to understand the complex issues of environment and climate change by the Doctors, Scientists and Researchers. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Globally 19% of all cancers are attributable to the environment. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.26" top="431.5"><span x0="72.02" y0="431.5" x1="526.26" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 82.69; y0: 431.5; y1: 443.5; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Most of the diseases attributed to climate conditions are also influenced by the socio economic parameters driven by different developmental paradigms resulting in creating conducive environment for the occurrence and spread of the disease. Therefore, along with the interventions of the advancing medical science and pharmacology, though diseases are being controlled, but the trends of the diseases over the years when seen in totality do not seem to be exclusively driven by climate. However, it is known that with climate change some of the diseases may spread to newer areas and there might be emergence of new diseases as well. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.04" top="304.54"><span x0="72.02" y0="304.54" x1="526.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 304.54; y1: 316.54; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">As per National Health Profile 2015 prepared by Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, the number of cases and deaths reported in the year 2014 in Delhi were as follows: 557 cases of Malaria (while no deaths were reported), 08 cases of Chikunguniya, 995 cases of Dengue (03 deaths reported), 113,677 cases of Acute Diarhoeal Diseases (73 deaths reported), 25,131 cases of Enteric Fever (Typhoid) (14 deaths reported), 339,506 cases of Acute Respiratory Infection (104 deaths reported), 6,425 cases of Viral Hepatitis (95 deaths reported), 25,640 cases of Pneumonia (402 deaths reported) and 1,118 new cases of Leprosy (April to Oct.14).
