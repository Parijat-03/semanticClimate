<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A random sample of 200 concordance lines of <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> was exported from AntConc to Excel and annotated for thematic roles (see <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">Hilpert [2014</xref>: 27] for a list and discussion of frequently used thematic/semantic roles). We found that in half (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;100) of all cases, the <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> were construed solely as either Beneficiaries or Recipients, while 72 lines featured <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> in the role of Agent, with 30 of these <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> situated as Agent only by virtue of being simultaneously a Beneficiary, Recipient, or Theme. Some examples of these are given below in (1)&#8211;(4).</p>
