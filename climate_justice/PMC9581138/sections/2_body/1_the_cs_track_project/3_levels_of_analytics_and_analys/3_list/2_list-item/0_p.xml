<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">(3) <italic>Macro level applications</italic>: Here, we harvest information from an open space that goes beyond the projects captured in the CS Track database. This allows for identifying special connections and trends related to the interplay between CS activities and a broader public. Such interactions take place in different social media of which the Twitter &#8220;blogosphere&#8221; is particularly suited as a source of analysis since it provides rich textual information with high potential for systematic search and retrieval (Mazumdar and Thakker, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Network models can be built on the basis of different relations such as retweeting or following. Structural network analysis can be combined with content analysis of tweets.</p>
