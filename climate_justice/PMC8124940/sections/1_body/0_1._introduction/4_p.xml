<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Delhi, India&#8217;s capital and second largest city by population, has been widely studied in terms of the spatial distribution of heat [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The severity of the situation here is exemplified by a heatwave in May 2015 during which temperatures rose beyond 44 &#176;C, which reportedly was hot enough to melt pavements [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies have linked the spatial distribution of heat in Delhi to social vulnerability through a focus on specific neighborhoods. One study on exposure to outdoor heat in three major South Asian cities, including Delhi, compared high and low-income neighborhoods along a selected transect in each city [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Collating data from mobile measurements and stationary sources, it was found that low to middle income neighborhoods were more likely to show compact settlement patterns and hence higher heat stress. Another study in East Delhi drew attention to how the characteristics of neighborhoods in terms of their economic activities and social composition shape exposure to heat [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This focus on selected areas can be extended through analyses which encompass the entire city, and build a more comprehensive portrayal of heat vulnerability at the urban scale.</p>
