Since 2000, almost 50&#160;million hectares of land have been acquired, and there are no signs of stagnation in the foreseeable future (Land Matrix 2018). The LSLA phenomenon, which largely targets agriculture, is widespread, including Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America (Rulli et al.&#160;2012; Nolte et al.&#160;2016; Constantin et al.&#160;2017). LSLAs are promoted by investors and host governments on economic grounds (infrastructure, employment, market development) (Deininger et al.&#160;2011), but their social and environmental impacts can be negative and signi&#64257;cant (Dell&#8217;Angelo et al.&#160;2017a).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="531.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.59; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="531.55" x1="313.21">Much of the criticism of LSLA focuses on its social impacts, especially the threat to local communities&#8217; land rights (especially indigenous people and women) (Anseeuw et al.&#160;2011) and displaced communities creating secondary land expansion (Messerli et al.&#160;2014; Davis et al.&#160;2015). The promises that LSLAs would develop ef&#64257;cient agriculture on non-forested, unused land (Deininger et al.&#160;2011) has so far not been ful&#64257;lled. However, LSLA is not the only outcome of weak land governance structures (Wang et al.&#160;2016): other forms of inequitable or irregular land acquisition can also be home-grown, pitting one community against a&#160;more vulnerable group (Xu 2018) or land capture by urban elites (McDonnell 2017). As demands on land are increasing, building governance capacity and securing land tenure becomes essential to attain sustainable land use, which has the potential to mitigate climate change, promote food security, and potentially reduce risks of climate-induced migration and associated risks of con&#64258;icts (Section&#160;7.6).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="276.49" top="315.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 315.42; y1: 325.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="315.42" x1="276.49">1.2.2 Progress in dealing with uncertainties in assessing land processes in the climate system</span></div><div left="65.2" right="301.47" top="279.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 279.42; y1: 289.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="279.42" x1="301.47">1.2.2.1 Concepts related to risk, uncertainty and con&#64257;dence</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.2" top="255.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="255.52" x1="313.2">In context of the SRCCL, risk refers to the potential for the adverse consequences for human or (land-based) ecological systems, arising from climate change or responses to climate change. Risk related to climate change impacts integrates across the hazard itself, the time of exposure and the vulnerability of the system; the assessment of all three of these components, their interactions and outcomes, is uncertain (see Glossary for expanded de&#64257;nition, and Section&#160;7.1.2). For instance, a&#160;risk to human society is the continued loss of productive land which might arise from climate change, mismanagement, or a&#160;combination of both factors. However, risk can also arise from the potential for adverse consequences from responses to climate change, such as widespread deployment of bioenergy which is intended to reduce GHG emissions and thus limit climate change, but can present its own risks to food security (Chapters&#160;5&#8211;7).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="75.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 75.56; y1: 85.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="75.56" x1="313.23">Demonstrating with some statistical certainty that the climate or the land system affected by climate or land use has changed (detection), </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="735.56"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 735.56; y1: 745.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.56" x1="571.75">and evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to that change (with a&#160;formal assessment of con&#64257;dence (attribution); see Glossary) remain challenging aspects in both observations and models (Rosenzweig and Neofotis 2013; Gillett et al.&#160;2016; Lean 2018). Uncertainties arising for example, from missing or imprecise data, ambiguous terminology, incomplete process representation in models, or human decision-making contribute to these challenges, and some examples are provided in this subsection. In order to re&#64258;ect various sources of uncertainties in the state of scienti&#64257;c understanding, IPCC assessment reports provide estimates of con&#64257;dence (Mastrandrea et al.&#160;2011). This con&#64257;dence language is also used in the SRCCL (Figure&#160;1.5).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="564.62" top="579.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 579.42; y1: 589.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="579.42" x1="564.62">1.2.2.2 Nature and scope of uncertainties related to land use</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="555.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="555.52" x1="571.75">Identi&#64257;cation and communication of uncertainties is crucial to support decision making towards sustainable land management.

It is continuously improving by enhanced Earth observation capacity (Hansen et al.&#160;2013; He et al.&#160;2018; Ard&#246; et al.&#160;2018; Spennemann et al.&#160;2018) (see also Table SM.1.1 in Supplementary Material). Likewise, the picture of how soil organic carbon, and GHG and water &#64258;uxes, respond to land-use change and land management continues to improve through advances in methodologies and sensors (Kostyanovsky et al.&#160;2018; Br&#252;mmer et al.&#160;2017; Iwata et al.&#160;2017; Valayamkunnath et al.&#160;2018). In both cases, the relative shortness of the record, data gaps, data treatment algorithms and&#160;&#8211; for remote sensing&#160;&#8211; differences in the de&#64257;nitions of major vegetation-cover classes limit the detection of trends (Alexander et al.&#160;2016a; Chen et al.&#160;2014; Yu et al.&#160;2014; Lacaze et al.&#160;2015; Song 2018; Peterson et al.&#160;2017). In many developing countries, the cost of satellite remote sensing remains a&#160;challenge,&#160;although technological advances are starting to overcome this problem (Santilli et al.&#160;2018), while ground-based observations networks are often not available.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.73" top="219.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 219.57; y1: 229.07; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="219.57" x1="571.73">Integration of multiple data sources in model and data assimilation schemes reduces uncertainties (Li et al.&#160;2017; Clark et al.&#160;2017; Lees et al.&#160;2018), which might be important for the advancement of early warning systems. Early warning systems are a&#160;key feature of short-term (i.e.&#160;seasonal) decision-support systems and are becoming increasingly important for sustainable land management and food security (Shtienberg 2013; Jarroudi et al.&#160;2015) (Sections&#160;6.2.3 and&#160;7.4.3). Early warning systems can help to optimise fertiliser and water use, aid disease suppression, and/or increase the economic bene&#64257;t by enabling strategic farming decisions on when and what to plant (Caf&#64257; et al.&#160;2012; Watmuff et al.&#160;2013; Jarroudi et al.&#160;2015; Chipanshi et al.&#160;2015).
