Brandt (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) notes that Santal indigenous people have complex religious beliefs and are subjected to considerable missionary efforts by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Whilst these efforts are placing a strain on Santal indigenous religion, she observes that missionaries are often the only institution interacting with the Santal (Brandt <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; see also Gauri and Galel <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; and Samad <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).
