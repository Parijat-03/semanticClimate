Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems account for one-third of all human-caused GHGs, with animal agriculture contributing at least 14.5% of overall GHGs.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Agricultural expansion, including for cattle grazing and feedcrops fed to billions of animals raised on factory farms and feedlots, is a principal driver of biodiversity and habitat loss and land use change and conversion.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Large-scale animal agriculture also consumes immense quantities of potable water, wasting much of it.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> And it edges out smaller-scale producers, and, in some cases, &#8220;grabs&#8221; land illegally (sometimes through threats, intimidation, and violence), as in Brazil&#8217;s Amazon forest and Cerrado savanna.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
