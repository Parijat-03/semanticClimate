<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The CS Track framework aims to complement existing methods for evaluating CS, address gaps in current observations of the citizen science landscape and integrate findings from multiple studies and methodologies. The work done in this project so far and reported briefly above, should be seen as pioneering in its efforts to use mixed analytic and social science methods along with the triangulation of results from different sources, to achieve a broad picture of social phenomena related to the case of CS. Future work is expected to concentrate on refining the measurement and evaluation scheme for CS and summarize results of our analysis to provide further recommendations for best practices and policies for the CS community.</p>
