<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One way of assessing the contribution of current and past greenhouse gas emissions to global warming is to examine its major contributing component, namely carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a major by-product of fossil fuel combustion. The estimated global annual emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> were about 5 billion metric tons in 1950, increasing to 22 billion metric tons by 1990, with the most recent estimate (2019) reaching over 36 billion metric tons.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This amounts to greater than a sevenfold increase in annual atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 70 years, while the world population rose only threefold in that same time frame (2.5 billion to 7.8 billion).<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These figures reflect a sharp increase in per capita combustion of fossil fuels, which have provided the main source of energy for a fast-growing world economy. However, this dependence on fossil fuels has come at a high a price&#8212;a warming planet at the edge of a precipitous global calamity.</p>
