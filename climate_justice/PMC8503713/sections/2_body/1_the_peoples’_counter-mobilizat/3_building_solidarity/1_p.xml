The virtual modalities required by travel restrictions due to the ongoing pandemic have caused much inequity in civil society&#8217;s (and many parties in the Global South) capacity to engage in ongoing UN processes such as the Convention on Biological Diversity&#8217;s (CBD) work on the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, or the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) meetings on Article 9: Farmer&#8217;s Rights. And yet we applied ourselves to the problems caused by working across time zones, staggering timings of meetings and hosting regional meetings to gather movement input that could be taken to global meetings hosted at unfriendly hours for many in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
