<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">emergence</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><div><p class="definition" style="font-weight: bold">Emergence of a <em><a href="#climate_change" class="mention">climate change</a></em> signal or trend refers to when a change in <em><a href="#climate" class="mention">climate</a></em> (the ‘signal’) becomes larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining the ‘noise’), This concept is often expressed as a ‘signal-to-noise’ ratio and emergence occurs at a defined threshold of this ratio (e.g., S/N &gt; 1 or 2).</p><p>Emergence can refer to changes relative to a historical or modern baseline (usually at least 20 years long) and can also be expressed in terms of time (<em><a href="#time_of_emergence" class="mention">time of emergence</a></em>) or in terms of a global warming level. Emergence is also used to refer to a time when we can expect to see a response to reducing <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions (emergence with respect to <em><a href="#mitigation" class="mention">mitigation</a></em>). Emergence can be estimated using observations and/or model simulations.</p></div></dd><div>
