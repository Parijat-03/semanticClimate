<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A literature review of how various cultural norms in Bangladesh can contribute to leaving specific groups behind (Farnworth and Jahan <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found a tendency in some studies to generalise, in particular relying on what people say is happening rather than examining what is actually happening. This hampers analytic clarity on the interaction between different drivers of marginalisation. The situation is made more complex by lack of agreement on the number of different ethnicities in the country, with the government recognising 27 but others claiming 45 or more (Pant et al. <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
