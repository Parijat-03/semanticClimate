      <td>Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are compounds such as methane and sulphate aerosols that warm or cool the\nEarth&#8217;s climate over shorter time scales &#8211; from days to years &#8211; than greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, whose\nclimatic effect lasts for decades, centuries or more. Because SLCFs do not remain in the atmosphere for very\nlong, their effects on the climate are different from one region to another and can change rapidly in response\nto changes in SLCF emissions. As some SLCFs also negatively affect air quality, measures to improve air quality\nhave resulted in sharp reductions in emissions and concentrations of those SLCFs in many regions over the few</td>

Warming SLCFs are either greenhouse gases (e.g., ozone or methane) or\nparticles like black carbon (also known as soot), which warm the climate by absorbing energy and are sometimes\nreferred to as short-lived climate pollutants. Cooling SLCFs, on the other hand, are mostly made of aerosol\nparticles (e.g., sulphate, nitrate and organic aerosols) that cool down the climate by reflecting away more</td>

For instance, deposition of black carbon on snow darkens its surface, which\nsubsequently absorbs more solar energy, leading to more melting and more warming. Aerosols also modify the\nproperties of clouds, which has indirect cooling effects on the climate and causes changes in local rainfall (see\nFAQ 7.2). Climate models indicate that SLCFs have altered atmospheric circulation on local and even hemispheric\nscales (e.g., monsoons) as well as regional precipitation.
