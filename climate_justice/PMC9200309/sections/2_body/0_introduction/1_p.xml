Escalating Climate Change impacts across the world is increasing potential for litigation to be brought against corporations, governments, and other parties by individuals and communities on the basis of current or future harm to their health and wellbeing. This risk of legal liability is a key factor in shaping climate-compliant economies whereby actors seek to protect assets, minimize risk and seek opportunities that are within the boundaries of legal regulatory frameworks.</p>
