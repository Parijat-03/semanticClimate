The low number of directly health-linked climate cases and the number where decisions are pending, precludes accurate assessment of trends in the receptivity of courts to public health-framed argumentation. The early successes, such as Urgenda Foundation v State of the Netherlands (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 1) and other cases are testament to the potential power of public health claims in legal argumentation, yet it remains premature to conclude whether or not public health arguments presented to courts will be seen with the credibility and weight that they warrant.</p>
