A suggested due diligence checklist may include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>If your jurisdiction is regulated, is this individual registered?

This requires regular engagement in continuing education and maintenance of malpractice insurance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The PedANP maintains a list of professional members. However, membership only suggests an interest in pediatrics, not a specialization. The Fellowship of the American Board of Naturopathic Pediatrics (FABNP) designation indicates that the individual has met standards of certification, but this is not an accreditation of exclusion. Any naturopathic doctor may see children.</p></list-item></list></p>
