Floodplain location is a key policy tool used to attempt to compel the uptake of flood insurance and other flood mitigation measures. This is important, as the insured homeowners, or those that were forewarned, are more likely to have the resources to pay for reconstruction and recovery. As such, a house located outside the floodplain is less likely to have access to recovery funding and is less likely to recover well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, the racial inequalities we find in the damage can be further exacerbated during the disaster recovery process.</p>
