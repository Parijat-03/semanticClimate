<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par4">CCA is distinguished from responses that are associated with potentially traumatic climate-related experiences, such as extreme weather events, and is thought to arise from the fuller range of climate change-related exposures, including exposure to climate change via the media (Clayton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). There is little consensus on how to conceptualize CCA from a mental health standpoint, with some describing it as a &#8220;pop-culture trend&#8221; (Grist, 2019), others as an appropriate and normal response, and still others as a clinical disorder that needs treatment (Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>). Disagreement surrounding the construct may be in part due to criticism regarding medicalization of legitimate environmental concerns, but may also reflect the fact that, until recently, there were few measures of CCA, with existing measures focusing more generally on negative emotions related to climate change, rather than on CCA specifically (e.g., Eisenman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Searle &amp; Gow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>).</p>
