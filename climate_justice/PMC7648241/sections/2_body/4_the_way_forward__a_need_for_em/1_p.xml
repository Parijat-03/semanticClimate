A crisis is a &#8220;mirror into which we can look and see exposed both our individual selves and our collective societies&#8221; (Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>). Both climate change and the coronavirus pandemic attest to the fact that we are now living in the Anthropocene, the era in which unsustainable growth of human activities has caused a significant change in the global environment. But at the same time, the two crises have exposed a deep, widespread inequality in the twenty-first-century society&#8212;a chronic social illness of our time. As inequality in society is intrinsically coupled with changes in the ecological condition (Hamann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>), addressing socio-economic inequality is imperative for global sustainability science. In light of this, we suggest the three research agendas for future climate and sustainability research after the pandemic.</p>
