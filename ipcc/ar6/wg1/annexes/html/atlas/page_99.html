Recently, warm events in the West Antarctica associated with drizzle were observed (Nicolas et al., 26 2017; Wille et al., 2019). In the current climate, most rain falling on the Antarctic continent refreezes in the 27 snowpack due to the low temperature and thus also contributes to ice-sheet mass accumulation (Agosta et al., 28 2019; Lenaerts et al., 2019). 29 30 Direct observations of snowfall using traditional gauges are highly uncertain due to strong winds and 31 blowing snow. Only a few stations have started to be equipped with precipitation radars (Gorodetskaya et al., 32 2015; Grazioli et al., 2017) with records still not long enough to allow for the assessment of trends. Trends in 33 precipitation cannot be assessed with reanalyses because spurious changes are introduced by the increase in 34 assimilated satellite observations (Nicolas and Bromwich, 2011).

Precipitation 37 trends in CMIP5 models which simulate snowfall rates within &#177;20 % of the CloudSat estimates give an 38 average Antarctic precipitation increase of 2.1 mm per decade from 1956 to 2000 (Palerme et al., 2017).  39 40 In the context of lack of precipitation measurements, observations of surface mass balance (net snow 41 accumulation on the surface) through various techniques (summarized by Lenaerts et al. (2019)) &#8211; including 42 annually resolved radar transects (Eisen et al., 2008), stake lines (Favier et al., 2013), sonic snow height 43 meters on automatic weather stations (Gorodetskaya et al., 2013) and ice core records (Thomas et al., 2015, 44 2017) &#8211;, are considered as a good proxy of precipitation if averaged over a sufficiently long period (e.g., 45 yearly).  46 47 The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a significant increase in surface mass balance, beginning in about 48 1930 and accelerating during the 1990s (Thomas et al., 2017). This is the only region in Antarctica where 49 both the most recent 50-year and 100-year trends are outside of the observed range for the past 300 years. 50 West Antarctica overall has shown a stable surface mass balance from 1980 to 2009 but with high regional 51 variability (Medley et al., 2013). Significant increases in accumulation are observed on the east side of the 52 West Antarctic ice sheet divide of 5 to 15 mm water equivalent per decade from 1957 to 2000 with 53 significant decreases on the west side of -1 to -5 mm water equivalent per decade from 1901 to 1956 and -5 54 to -15 mm water equivalent per decade from 1957 to 2000 (Medley and Thomas, 2019).
