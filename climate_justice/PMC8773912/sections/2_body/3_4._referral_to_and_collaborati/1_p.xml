<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Given the heavy emphasis on the optimization of health and prevention of disease, arguably all children would benefit from consultation with an ND, whether or not there is a particular health concern. While other front-line healthcare providers value these priorities, they may be limited in their capacity to implement them due to systemic barriers such as training and billing practices [<xref rid="B48-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; of lifestyle medicine is a core focus of naturopathic training, and NDs spend a notable amount of time engaged in lifestyle counselling and strategies of behaviour change. Collaboration with an ND can ensure families receive pragmatic support in terms of anticipatory guidance and holistic lifestyle counselling. This allows others in the medical community to focus on their areas of expertise, while NDs can apply their unique lens to enhance the capacity of the child to remain well and heal efficiently from the inevitable health concerns of childhood. </p>
