<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par39">In the previous section, we argued that both the expertocratic shortcut and outright science denial are based on the same misunderstanding: the disregard of scientific uncertainty and legitimate disagreement (Moore and MacKenzie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). If the instrumental use of scientific knowledge as well as science denial are to be prevented, scientific expertise must not only be communicated in a comprehensible way, but potential uncertainties and disagreements among experts have to be made transparent. Moore and MacKenzie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>) identify the publication of minority reports in expert committees as one institutional mechanism through which this could be accomplished. Along the same lines, Pamuk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>, p. 570) suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s practice of the writing of dissenting opinions should also be adopted for expert bodies. This practice also serves another purpose: As Pamuk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>) shows, the two expectations of neutrality and usefulness placed on expert commissions stand in an inherent tension with each other: To be useful, scientific advice must, to some extent, include value judgments, which tends to violate the requirement of neutrality and can thus diminish the authority and legitimacy of expertise. This dilemma can only be mitigated if expertise is exposed to greater public scrutiny, for which the publication of dissenting opinions is a prerequisite&#160;(ibid.).</p>
