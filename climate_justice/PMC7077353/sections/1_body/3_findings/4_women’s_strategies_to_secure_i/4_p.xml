They encouraged her to try out new varieties and to participate in agricultural training courses. This included learning to drive the PTOS and operate a thresher, and now she acts as a hired machinery operator. Joytee started to access information on seeds, pesticides and market prices through her mobile phone and she went to the local market to obtain information directly from various NGOs. Whereas in 2013 Joytee and her family were among the most impoverished in the community, on the lowest rung of four according to the Ladder of Life exercise, in 2015 the household assessed itself to be on level 3 which is considered middle-income. She is sending her daughters to good colleges, has purchased quality furniture and started a savings account, and highlights that she has time for her family, as well as leisure. Joytee attributes her success to working closely with the RDRS and the Kalipara Union Federation and argues that anyone who wants to succeed must have institutional support. They cannot succeed on their own. They also have to have faith in the new technologies. Joytee&#8217;s standing in the community has risen, such that Santal, as well as ethnic Bengali Muslims, both women and men, decided to imitate her by trialling the innovations, including leasing in land in order to try them out.</p>
