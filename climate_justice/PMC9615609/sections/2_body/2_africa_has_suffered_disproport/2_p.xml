In 2018, devastating cyclones impacted three million people in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In west and central Africa, severe flooding resulted in mortality and forced migration from loss of shelter, cultivated land, and livestock [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Changes in vector ecology brought about by floods and damage to environmental hygiene has led to increases in diseases across sub-Saharan Africa, with rises in malaria, dengue fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Lyme disease, Ebola virus, West Nile virus and other infections [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Rising sea levels reduce water quality, leading to water-borne diseases, including diarrhoeal diseases, a leading cause of mortality in Africa [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Extreme weather damages water and food supply, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, which causes 1.7 million deaths annually in Africa [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, malnutrition has increased by almost 50% since 2012, owing to the central role agriculture plays in African economies [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Environmental shocks and their knock-on effects also cause severe harm to mental health [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In all, it is estimated that the climate crisis has destroyed a fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries most vulnerable to climate shocks [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
