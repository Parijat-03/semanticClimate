Many families now have their houses on what could be called minute islands (e.g., Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Most of the dikes that used to be the trails linking the houses have been destroyed, and some children go to school by canoe while others must swim. Having to date received scarce support from the state, NGOs, or international donors, Djobel's inhabitants are being transformed into climate migrants/displaced people with nowhere to go.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Houses settled on minute "islands"</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10745_2022_352_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>View of a settlement at low tide</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10745_2022_352_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p>
