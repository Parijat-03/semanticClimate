However, from a human health perspective, changing meat consumption habits still forms only a marginal part of the nutrition transformation required for limiting the burden from non-communicable diseases (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Afshin et al., 2019</xref>). Shifts toward healthier and more environmentally friendly diets therefore imply broader adjustments in food systems, and would also affect some products such as fruits, vegetable, oilseeds, and nuts; this would require more radical transformations (<xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">Willett et al., 2019</xref>), as well as addressing some associated trade-offs in terms of water consumption or other environmental impacts (<xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Springmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
