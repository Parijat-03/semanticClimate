The notion of environmental justice originated in the U.S. in the mid-1980&#160;s within the context of a broader movement for racial equality and increasing recognition that low-income communities and communities of color were disproportionately impacted by toxic waste dumping and industrial siting.

Global labor organizations in the EU, on the other hand, have been advocating for just transition principles, initially under alternative designations like sustainable development and &#8216;green jobs,&#8217; since the late 1990&#160;s. Organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) have long been involved in global environmental negotiations and have become leaders on advocacy for a range of objectives in support of a just transition <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
