      <td>Century-scale projections for all glaciers on Earth including those around the periphery of Greenland and Antarctica are presented here.\nProjections of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are presented in Chapter 4. Future changes in glacier mass have global implications\nthrough their contribution to sea level change (Chapter 4) and local implication, for example, by affecting freshwater resources (Section 2.3.1).\nGlacier decline can also lead to loss of palaeoclimate information contained in glacier ice (Thompson et al., 2017).</td>

      <td>AR5 included projections of 21st century glacier evolution from four process-based global-scale glacier models (Slangen and Van\nDe Wal, 2011; Marzeion et al., 2012; Giesen and Oerlemans, 2013; Radi&#263; et al., 2014). Results have since been updated (Bliss et al.,\n2014; Slangen et al., 2017; Hock et al., 2019) using new glacier inventory data and/or climate projections, and projections from two\nadditional models have been presented (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Huss and Hock, 2015). These six models were driven by climate\nprojections from 8&#8211;21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) forced by various RCPs, and results are\nsystematically compared in Hock et al. (2019).</td>

      <td>Based on these studies there is high confidence that glaciers in polar and high mountain regions will lose substantial mass by the\nend of the century. Results indicate global glacier mass losses by 2100 relative to 2015 of 18% (likely range 11&#8211;25%) (mean of\nall projections with range referring to &#177; one standard deviation) for scenario RCP2.6 and 36% (likely range 26&#8211;47%) for RCP8.5,\nbut relative mass reductions vary greatly between regions (Figure CB6.1). Projected end-of-century mean mass losses relative to\n2015 tend to be largest in mountain regions dominated by smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover, exceeding on average\n80%, for example, the European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus/Middle East, Low Latitudes and North Asia for RCP8.5 (see Figure 2.1 for\nregion definitions). While these glaciers&#8217; contribution to sea level is negligible their large relative mass losses have implications for\nstreamflow (Section 2.3.1, FAQ 2.1).</td>

      <td>The magnitude and timing of these projected mass losses is assigned medium confidence because the projections have been\ncarried out using relatively simple models calibrated with limited observations in some regions and diverging initial glacier volumes.\nFor example, mass loss by iceberg calving and subaqueous melt processes that can be particularly important components of glacier\nmass budgets in polar regions (McNabb et al., 2015) have only been included in one global-scale study (Huss and Hock, 2015).\nIn addition instability mechanisms that can cause rapid glacier retreat and mass loss are not considered (Dunse et al., 2015;\nSevestre et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2018).</td>

      <td>The projected global-scale relative mass losses 2015&#8211;2100 correspond to a sea level contribution of 94 (likely range 69&#8211;119) mm sea\nlevel equivalent (SLE) corresponding to an average rate of 1.1 (likely range 0.8&#8211;1.4) mm SLE yr&#8211;1 for RCP2.6, and 200 (likely range\n156 to 240) mm SLE, a rate of 2.4 (likely range 1.8&#8211;2.8) mm SLE yr&#8211;1 for RCP8.5, in addition to the sea level contribution from the\nGreenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Chapter 4). Averages refer to the mean and ranges to &#177; one standard deviation of all simulations.\nFor RCP2.6, rates increase only slightly until approximately year 2040 with a steady decline thereafter, as glaciers retreat to higher\nelevations and reach new equilibrium. In contrast, for RCP8.5, the sea level contribution from glaciers increases steadily for most of\nthe century, reaching an average maximum rate exceeding 3 mm SLE yr&#8211;1 (Hock et al., 2019). For both RCPs the polar regions are the\nlargest contributors with projected mass reductions by 2100 relative to 2015 combined for the Antarctic periphery, Arctic Canada, the\nGreenland periphery, Iceland, Russian Arctic, Scandinavia and Svalbard ranging from 16% (likely range 9 to 23%) for RCP2.6 to 33%\n(likely range 22 to 44%) for RCP8.5. Due to extensive ice cover, these regions make up roughly 80% of the global sea level contribution\nfrom glaciers by 2100. The global projections are similar to those reported in AR5 for the period 2081&#8211;2100 relative to 1986&#8211;2005,\nif differences in period length and domain are accounted for (AR5&#8217;s glacier estimates excluded the Antarctic periphery). The eleven\nmountain regions covered in Chapter 2 are likely to lose 22&#8211;44% of their glacier mass by 2100 relative to 2015 for RCP2.6 and\n37&#8211;57% for RCP8.5. Worldwide many glaciers are expected to disappear by 2100 regardless emission scenario, especially in regions\nwith smaller glaciers (very high confidence) (Cullen et al. 2013; Rabatel et al., 2013; Huss and Fischer, 2016; Rabatel et al., 2017).</td>
