<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par7">In essence, the main aim of climate change education (CCE), which is rooted in education for sustainable development (ESD) (UNESCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>), is to engage different stakeholders in promoting lifelong education for global citizenship and help build a knowledge society in which local communities act upon&#160;recommendations. Educating for this type of change is a challenge in traditional western education because education is no longer considered a top-down transmission of knowledge, information, and values (Varga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2007</xref>).&#160;Rather,&#160;a bottom-up approach promotes creativity and ownership of joint involvement and action, allowing for a leveraging of specialized knowledge and experiences contributed by citizens (Fraser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>; Wi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>). However, there are some advantages to a top-down educational&#160;approach. According to Wi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>), its simplicity and efficiency in decision making as well as its ability to mobilize more resources and generate widespread awareness can help get things done. Ultimately, Wi argues for a collaboration and infusion of both approaches as key to a successful implementation of CCE.</p>
