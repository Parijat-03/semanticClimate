      <td>Dietary change</td>
      <td>Sustainable healthy diets represent a range of dietary\nchanges to improve human diets, to make them healthy\nin terms of the nutrition delivered, and also (economically,\nenvironmentally and socially) sustainable. A &#8216;contract\nand converge&#8217; model of transition to sustainable healthy\ndiets would involve a reduction in over-consumption\n(particularly of livestock products) in over-consuming\npopulations, with increased consumption of some food\ngroups in populations where minimum nutritional needs\nare not met. Such a conversion could result in a decline\nin undernourishment, as well as reduction in the risk of\nmorbidity and mortality due to over-consumption.</td>
      <td>A dietary shift away from meat can reduce GHG\nemissions, reduce cropland and pasture requirements,\nenhance biodiversity protection, and reduce mitigation\ncosts. Additionally, dietary change can both increase\npotential for other land-based response options and reduce\nthe need for them by freeing land. By decreasing pressure\non land, demand reduction through dietary change could\nalso allow for decreased production intensity, which\ncould reduce soil erosion and provide benefits to a range\nof other environmental indicators such as deforestation\nand decreased use of fertiliser (nitrogen and phosphorus),\npesticides, water and energy, leading to potential benefits\nfor adaptation, desertification, and land degradation.</td>

      <td>Reduced post-\nharvest losses</td>
      <td>Approximately one-third of the food produced for\nhuman consumption is wasted in post-production\noperations. Most of these losses are due to poor storage\nmanagement. Post-harvest food losses underlie the\nfood system&#8217;s failure to equitably enable accessible and\naffordable food in all countries. Reduced post-harvest\nfood losses can improve food security in developing\ncountries (while food loss in developed countries mostly\noccurs at the retail/consumer stage). The key drivers for\npost-harvest waste in developing countries are structural\nand infrastructure deficiencies. Thus, reducing food waste\nat the post-harvest stage requires responses that process,\npreserve and, where appropriate, redistribute food to\nwhere it can be consumed immediately.</td>
      <td>Differences exist between farm food waste reduction\ntechnologies between small-scale agricultural systems and\nlarge-scale agricultural systems. A suite of options includes\nfarm-level storage facilities, trade or exchange processing\ntechnologies including food drying, on-site farm processing\nfor value addition, and improved seed systems. For large-\nscale agri-food systems, options include cold chains for\npreservation, processing for value addition and linkages to\nvalue chains that absorb the harvests almost instantly into\nthe supply chain. In addition to the specific options to reduce\nfood loss and waste, there are more systemic possibilities\nrelated to food systems. Improving and expanding the &#8216;dry\nchain&#8217; can significantly reduce food losses at the household\nlevel. Dry chains are analogous to the cold chain and refers\nto the &#8216;initial dehydration of durable commodities to levels\npreventing fungal growth&#8217; followed by storage in moisture-\nproof containers. Regional and local food systems are now\nbeing promoted to enable production, distribution, access\nand affordability of food. Reducing post-harvest losses has\nthe potential to reduce emissions and could simultaneously\nreduce food costs and increase availability. The perishability\nand safety of fresh foods are highly susceptible to\ntemperature increase.</td>

      <td>Material\nsubstitution</td>
      <td>Material substitution involves the use of wood or\nagricultural biomass (e.g., straw bales) instead of\nfossil fuel-based materials (e.g., concrete, iron, steel,\naluminium) for building, textiles or other applications.</td>
      <td>Material substitution reduces carbon emissions &#8211; both\nbecause the biomass sequesters carbon in materials while\nre-growth of forests can lead to continued sequestration,\nand because it reduces the demand for fossil fuels, delivering\na benefit for mitigation. However, a potential trade-off\nexists between conserving carbon stocks and using forests\nfor wood products. If the use of material for substitution\nwas large enough to result in increased forest area, then\nthe adverse side effects for adaptation and food security\nwould be similar to that of reforestation and afforestation.\nIn addition, some studies indicate that wooden buildings,\nif properly constructed, could reduce fire risk compared\nto steel, creating a co-benefit for adaptation. The effects\nof material substitution on land degradation depend on\nmanagement practice; some forms of logging can lead to\nincreased land degradation. Long-term forest management\nwith carbon storage in long-lived products also results in\natmospheric CO2 removal.</td>
