Globally, energy consumption often requires burning of fossil fuels. Consequently, increasing energy consumption increases the risks of dangerous climate change. Yet, to not increase energy consumption given current energy technologies means that some parts of the world are not given the chance for economic development and increased well-being, lest highly substantial mitigation is done in high-emitting countries. This leads to energy consumption being a form of &#8216;good&#8217; that has to be fairly distributed.</p>
