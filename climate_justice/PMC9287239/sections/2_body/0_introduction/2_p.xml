When the practice of setting SBTs was in its infancy, Trexler and Schendler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] argued that SBTs could end up being an &#8220;unintentional, but devilishly clever way in which opponents of long-term climate action could help delay and undercut progress&#8221; by advancing &#8220;the mistaken notion that companies can substitute for public policy.&#8221; To this, Marland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] responded that the adoption of SBTs and other corporate climate initiatives &#8220;can be a positive force for the demand and implementation of climate policy.&#8221; Six years after this exchange, detailed guidelines for setting certified SBTs have been developed, data on companies&#8217; engagement with SBTs have been generated, and a body of academic literature on the topic has emerged.</p>
