Yet, the idea of linking corporate environmental performance and targets to external environmental goals is much older. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative has encouraged companies to disclose environmental performance in relation to &#8220;global limits on resource use and pollution levels&#8221; for two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A few companies followed suit early on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but widespread adoption appears to have been hampered by a lack of external pressure and operational methods and tools, with some notable exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Instead, corporate emission targets largely appeared arbitrary, perhaps inspired by competitors&#8217; targets, past performance, or what appeared achievable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and were often judged to lack ambition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In 2015, the Paris Agreement rallied 196 nations &#8220;to limit global warming to well-below 2&#160;&#176;C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5&#160;&#176;C&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The agreement&#8217;s polycentric governance approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the apparent insufficiency of national determined contributions to meeting its temperature goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] meant that large companies, and other non-party stakeholders, came under pressure to take action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Around the same time, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) was created, coining the term &#8220;science-based target&#8221; in a corporate context, offering companies methods, tools, and guidelines for setting GHG emission targets aligned with the Paris temperature goal while acting as a target certifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
