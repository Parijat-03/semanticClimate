In contrast to extreme weather events, SLR is insidious, slow in onset and subtle in effects, and is primarily driven by three factors: ocean thermal expansion, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and changes in terrestrial water storage <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A one-meter rise in the sea level can bring catastrophic effects such as submergence of agricultural lands, human settlements, and infrastructure. Many of the impacts of SLR on affected communities are similar to those driven by extreme weather events - food insecurity, forced displacement, and healthcare access disruption.</p>
