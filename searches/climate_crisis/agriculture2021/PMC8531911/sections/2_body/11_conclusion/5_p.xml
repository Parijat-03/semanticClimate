This regime consummates a world-historical narrative of development built on racism and abyssal thinking: where what is made visible is at the expense of what is rendered invisible: indigenous peoples, migrant labour circuits, and farming systems that appear to belong to &#8216;the past&#8217;. In this vein, the 2019 US Ambassador to the FAO, Kip Tom, railed against a growing sentiment among UN member countries, and the FAO itself with its HLPE report on <italic>Agroecological and Other Innovative Approaches,</italic> that such policy recommendation &#8216;did not share the basic values and core assumptions on which we operate here in the United States [and is] an explicit rejection of the very idea of progress&#8217;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> .</p>
