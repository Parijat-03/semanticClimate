Justice Alito laid the groundwork for overturning the decision in two earlier cases, inviting a case that would provide an opportunity to overturn <italic>Abood</italic> (Greenhouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>, 342&#8211;46; Knox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>, 314; Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>, 633&#8211;38). An earlier case seeking that result failed after Justice Scalia died while the case was pending in the Court (Greenhouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>, 344). The Senate refused to hold a hearing on President Obama&#8217;s nominee to replace Justice Scalia and accordingly, his replacement was appointed by President Trump in 2017. Given the makeup of the Court and the signals from earlier opinions, unions began to prepare for elimination of fair share fees. Unions employed several strategies to meet the challenge of <italic>Janus</italic>. Unions have expanded internal organizing among their members, successfully pushed for enactment of state laws to aid their efforts to maintain membership, and developed allies among the public by focusing on issues of mutual interest.</p>
