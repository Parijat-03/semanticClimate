Strengthening these areas would drive transformational change, leading to behavioural change and broader adoption of sustainable environmental practices. Detailed analysis of barriers as well as strategies, methods and approaches to scale up SLM have been undertaken for GEF programmes in Africa, China and globally (Tengberg and Valencia 2018; Liniger et al. 2011; Tengberg et al. 2016). A&#160;number of interconnected barriers and bottlenecks to the scaling up of SLM have been identi&#64257; ed in this context and are related to: </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.56" top="603.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.28; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="603.54" x1="307.56">&#8226; limited access to knowledge and information, including new SLM technologies and problem-solving capacities &#8226; weak enabling environment, including the policy, institutional and legal framework for SLM, and land tenure and property rights &#8226; inadequate learning and adaptive knowledge management in the project cycle, including monitoring and evaluation of impacts&#8226; limited access to &#64257; nance for scaling up, including public and private funding, innovative business models for SLM technologies and &#64257; nancial mechanisms and incentives, such as payment for ecosystem services (PES), insurance and micro-credit schemes (see also Shames et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="459.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="459.56" x1="307.57">Adoption of innovations and new technologies are increasingly analysed using the transition theory framework (Geels 2002), the starting point being the recognition that many global environmental problems cannot be solved by technological change alone, but require more far-reaching change of social-ecological systems. Using transition theory makes it possible to analyse how adoption and implementation follow the four stages of sociotechnical transitions, </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.69; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.57" x1="566.12">from predevelopment of technologies and approaches at the niche level, take-off and acceleration, to regime shift and stabilisation at the landscape level. According to a&#160;recent review of sustainability transitions in developing countries (Wieczorek 2018), three internal niche processes are important, including the formation of networks that support and nurture innovation, the learning process, and the articulation of expectations to guide the learning process. While technologies are important, institutional and political aspects form the major barriers to transition and upscaling. In developing and transition economies, informal institutions play a&#160;pivotal role, and transnational linkages are also important, such as global value chains. In these countries, it is therefore more dif&#64257; cult to establish fully coherent regimes or groups of individuals who share expectations, beliefs or behaviour, as there is a&#160;high level of uncertainty about rules and social networks or dominance of informal institutions, which creates barriers to change. This uncertainty is further exacerbated by climate change. Landscape forces comprise a&#160;set of slow-changing factors, such as broad cultural and normative values, long-term economic effects such as urbanisation, and shocks such as war and crises that can lead to change. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="483.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 483.6; y1: 493.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="483.6" x1="566.09">A study on SLM in the Kenyan highlands using transition theory concluded that barriers to adoption of SLM included high poverty levels, a&#160;low-input/low-output farming system with limited potential to generate income, diminishing land sizes, and low involvement of the youth in farming activities. Coupled with a&#160;poor coordination of government policies for agriculture and forestry, these barriers created negative feedbacks in the SLM transition process. Other factors to consider include gender issues and lack of secure land tenure.
