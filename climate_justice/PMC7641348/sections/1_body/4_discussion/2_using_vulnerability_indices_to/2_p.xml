<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There are limits to the effectiveness of using a single index to guide a fund with projects and communities as diverse as those under the CCI program. At present, CES is and has been used across state agencies for a variety of purposes beyond the GGRF, including but not limited to an abandoned underground storage tank initiative by the State Water Resources Control Board, allocation of renewable energy by the California Public Utilities Commission, and a project for active transportation by the California Department of Transportation [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Prior research has challenged the use of indices for broad and multifaceted applications [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] that fail to integrate contextual differences [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or to have a clearly defined purpose [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Further, race-based indicators, which have been shown to be uniquely associated with environmental justice due to structural discriminatory legacies, were removed to make the tool legally viable for multiple agencies [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although CES is responsive to environmental injustices, by itself it does not fully capture the climate justice adaptation problems that come with escalating extreme heat exposure. This work demonstrates that some indices may characterize some regions better than others, and that there is likely no &#8220;correct&#8221; index that can balance the unique geospatial drivers of vulnerability. A general, statewide tool could be useful for high-level screening, but context-specific tools that can better capture and reflect the nuances of the specific problem in question and local variabilities are also needed.</p>
