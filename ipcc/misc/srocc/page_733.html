Real options analysis develops &#64258;exible strategies that can be adjusted when additional climate information becomes available. It is most appropriate for large irreversible investment decisions. Applications to climate adaptation are growing quickly, with most studies addressing &#64258;ood risk and sea-level rise (Gersonius et al. 2013; Woodward et al. 2014; Dan 2016), but studies in land-use decisions are also emerging, including identifying the optimal time to switch land use in a&#160;changing climate (Sanderson et al. 2016) and water storage (Sturm et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2017). Portfolio analysis aims to reduce risk by diversi&#64257;cation, by planting multiple species rather than only one, for example, in forestry (Knoke et al. 2017) or crops (Ben-Ari and Makowski 2016), or in multiple locations. There may be a trade-off between robustness to variability and optimality (Yousefpour and Hanewinkel 2016; Ben-Ari and Makowski 2016); but this type of analysis can help identify and quantify trade-offs. Robust decision-making identi&#64257;es how different strategies perform under many climate outcomes, also potentially trading off optimality for resilience (Lempert 2013).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="423.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.11; y0: 423.58; y1: 433.08; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="423.58" x1="571.78">Multi-criteria decision-making continues to be an important tool in the land-use sector, with the capacity to simultaneously consider multiple goals across different domains (e.g., economic, environmental, social) (Bausch et al. 2014; Alr&#248; et al. 2016), and so is useful as a mitigation as well as an adaptation tool. Lifecycle assessment can also be used to evaluate emissions across a system&#160;&#8211; for example, in livestock production (McClelland et al. 2018) &#8211; and to identify areas to prioritise for reductions. Bottom-up marginal abatement cost curves calculate the most cost effective cumulative potential for mitigation across different options (Eory et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="291.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 291.6; y1: 301.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="291.6" x1="571.77">In the climate adaptation literature, these tools may be used in adaptive management (Section&#160;7.5.4), using a monitoring, research, evaluation and learning process (cycle) to improve future management strategies (Tompkins and Adger 2004). More recently these techniques have been advanced with iterative risk management (IPCC 2014a) (Sections 7.4.1 and 7.4.7), adaptation pathways (Downing 2012), and dynamic adaptation pathways (Haasnoot et al. 2013) (Section&#160;7.6.3). Decision-making tools can be selected and adapted to &#64257;t the speci&#64257;c land and climate problem and decision-making space. For instance, dynamic adaptation pathways processes (Haasnoot et al. 2013; Wise et al. 2014) identify and sequence potential actions based on alternative potential futures and are situated within the complex, unstructured space (see Figure&#160;7.5). Decisions are made based on trigger points, linked to indicators and scenarios, or changing performance over time (Kwakkel et al. 2016). A key characteristic of these pathways is that, rather than making irreversible decisions now, decisions evolve over time, accounting for learning (Section&#160;7.6.4), knowledge, and values. In New Zealand, combining dynamic adaptive pathways and a form of real options analysis with multiple-criteria decision analysis has enabled risk that </span></div></body></html>
