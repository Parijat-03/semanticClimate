<bold>E<sc>Vans</sc>:</bold> There's a lot to community archiving, particularly today, especially in marginalized communities, whether it's people of color, <sc>Lgbtq</sc>+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer), ethnic or indigenous groups, or the poor. Many identity groups have been left out of the historical narrative. And the argument has always been that there's not enough evidence for us to write about or consider this group. But if you have people who are active, whether it's the police archive or black artists who have protest art, and they were to collect it and hold onto it as long as they wanted to, then they either create a space where people can have access to it or gift it later. That's the community-archiving aspect of it. You, as the creator, control more than what you thought. And even after it's gifted to some place, you could still control it. It's educating donors, right? If we teach you now and you do it within your community, we may get the donations later or we may not. But we know it exists. And that's the whole purpose&#8212;not just to educate people on what we do but also to teach them how to do it so that it's there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref></sup></p>
