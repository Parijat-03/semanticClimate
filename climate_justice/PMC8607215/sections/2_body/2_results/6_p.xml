A narrow definition of the condition may be interpreted as an increase in the amount of heat beyond thermal comfort that negatively impacts the mental and physical condition of young people. Heat is an inevitable by-product of the human body. It is produced through a biochemical reaction and nerve coordination within the body. To sustain the proper functioning of the human system, the body occasionally discharges excess heat by circulating blood near the surface of the skin for cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. During seasons of an extremely hot climate, rooms or living spaces ought to be kept at a temperature below 24&#160;&#176;C during the night and 32&#160;&#176;C during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As indicated in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, under such temperate climates, heat is dissipated through three channels: evaporation of insensible perspiration (25%), convection in cool air (25%), and radiation (50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Humidity plays a key role in the dissipation process, as it impacts the quantity of heat that can be distilled and evaporated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Dissipation of heat under temperate climate</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Channels</th><th align="left">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Convection in cool air</td><td align="left">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Evaporation of insensible perspiration</td><td align="left">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Radiation</td><td align="left">50</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
