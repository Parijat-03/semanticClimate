These developments are based on improvements in the understanding of how the hazard interacts with the physical and socioeconomic elements, and how to capture these interactions in systematic modelling frameworks. The developments are also clearly reported especially in the area of addressing the underestimates in adaptation costs that the previous studies suffered from as the previous studies tended to rely on data from wealthy economies (Hochrainer-Stigler et&#160;al., 2014; Carleton et&#160;al., 2020). The adaptation cost estimates have also improved since the previous IPCC reports due to constant improvements in capturing the loss and damages of disaster events (Hochrainer-Stigler et&#160;al., 2014). The reliance of earlier studies on correlations to derive adaptation costs was addressed to some extent by addressing the endogeneity of disaster measures (Kousky, 2014), especially by relying upon the physical measures of disasters such as wind speed, although more work is needed in this area.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="125.12" top="414.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="414.48" x1="125.12" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.4.2 Findings</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.74" top="390.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="390.6" x1="307.74" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.24; y0: 390.6; y1: 400.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate change can cause significant impacts and as a result can impose considerable adaptation costs on countries and people. Despite the importance, the research on adaptation costs is limited in Asia, especially on the economy-wide costs, while fragmented literature is available on sector-level adaptation costs. Most of the available literature on adaptation costs at the regional level originate from the work carried out by development finance institutions such as ADB.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="294.61"><span x0="54.14" y0="294.61" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.54; y0: 294.61; y1: 304.11; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Estimates suggest that climate-change impacts could result in a loss of 2% of the GDP of South Asian countries by 2050 and 9% by 2100 (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014). These impacts will be felt in major vulnerable sectors, including agriculture, water, coastal, marine, health and energy, and will have significant impact on the economic growth and poverty reduction in the region. Countries could differ widely in terms of the economic costs they face. In South Asia, the economic costs were projected to be 12.6% of the GDP for the Maldives, which is the highest among the South Asian countries, and 6.6% for Sri Lanka, the least among the South Asian countries. The resultant adaptation costs for countries were projected to range from 0.36% (Copenhagen Cancun Scenario for 2050) to 1.32% (business-as-usual scenario) of the GDP in various scenarios during 2010&#8211;2050 (</span><span style="x0: 232.54; x1: 239.93; y0: 150.63; y1: 160.13; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="232.54" y0="150.63" x1="303.51">Medium agreement</span><span x0="303.51" y0="150.63" x1="307.72" style="x0: 303.51; x1: 305.79; y0: 150.63; y1: 160.13; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">, </span><span style="x0: 54.14; x1: 56.25; y0: 138.63; y1: 148.13; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="54.14" y0="138.63" x1="112.86">limited evidence</span><span x0="112.86" y0="138.63" x1="242.6" style="x0: 112.86; x1: 115.5; y0: 138.63; y1: 148.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="114.64"><span x0="54.14" y0="114.64" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 114.64; y1: 124.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Arto et&#160;al.

Using the residual damages as a measure of loss and damage, the authors have estimated adaptation costs and residual costs under scenarios of high damages&#8211;low discount rate and low damages&#8211;high discount rate. The estimates suggested adaptation costs of 182 and 193&#160;billion USD by 2050, and 737 and 783&#160;billion USD by 2100 for South Asia and East Asia, respectively, under the scenario of high damages&#8211;low discount rate. The residual costs for the same scenario were 289 and 76% for 2050 and 238 and 62% for 2100 for South Asia and East Asia, respectively. Estimates for low damages&#8211;high discount rate were significantly lower adaptation costs and residual costs for both of these sub-regions of Asia.</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.76" top="462.68"><span x0="318.18" y0="462.68" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 462.68; y1: 472.18; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The CCA efforts can be characterised as fragmented, incoherent and lacking perspective (Ahmed et&#160;al., 2019a), and the picture on adaptation financing can be stated as similarly fragmented with very limited literature published in peer-reviewed journals. Adaptation financing is crucial for supporting vulnerable countries and enhances adaptation, as it is evident that the enhanced adaptation finance support has positively affected the pace of adaptation in low-income countries (Ford et&#160;al., 2015). At the organisational level, adaptation financing has provided multiple functions that include risk assessment functions, valuation functions and risk disclosure functions (Linnenluecke et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="330.69"><span x0="318.18" y0="330.69" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 324.0; y0: 330.69; y1: 340.19; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Of the total global public adaptation finance of 28&#160;billion USD, East Asia and the Asia&#8211;Pacific attracted 46% of the total funding, while South Asian countries attracted only 9% of the total funding (UNEP, 2016). These differences reflect the capacity of countries to attract adaptation finance. Some of the important adaptation-targeted climate funds are Pilot Programmes for Climate Resilience, Green Climate Fund, and Least-Developed Countries Fund, and South Asian countries have significantly benefited from these dedicated climate funds. Due to the disaster implications of climate change, there is a need to allocate adaptation finances for DRR. Estimates suggest that East Asia and the Asia&#8211;Pacific in general allocated 27% of the total adaptation funds to DRR, while South Asia allocated 25% (Caravani, 2016). Low-income economies tend to allocate more adaptation funds to DRR (46%), while lower-middle-income economies allocated 22%.</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="150.72"><span x0="318.18" y0="150.72" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 150.72; y1: 160.22; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The least developed countries lack the capacity to adapt to climate change and the Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF) has made significant contributions to adaptation in these countries (</span><span style="x0: 552.78; x1: 558.23; y0: 126.72; y1: 136.22; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="552.78" y0="126.72" x1="571.77">High agreement, limited evidence</span><span x0="424.98" y0="114.72" x1="571.74" style="x0: 424.98; x1: 427.62; y0: 114.72; y1: 124.22; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).

They also found that these projects are taking a marginal approach, rather than a radical or transformational one, to adaptation.</span></div></body></html>
