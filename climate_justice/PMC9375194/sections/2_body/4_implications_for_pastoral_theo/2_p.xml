Our emotions, if we put them to good use, can help spur us into action (LaMothe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>) so that we do not get stuck in the despair of longing for what used to be. Collapsology can help us prepare &#8220;for the world that is to come, the world that we choose to rebuild, on new principles, among the other worlds that might take shape&#8221; (Bourg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>, p. xv). The same is true for pastoral theology, that it can also help us prepare for the world that is to come with, in the words of Tillich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>), a renewed &#8220;courage to be.&#8221;</p>
