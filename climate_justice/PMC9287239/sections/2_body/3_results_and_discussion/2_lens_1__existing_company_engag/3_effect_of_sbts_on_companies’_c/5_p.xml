Despite an increase in the share of companies setting targets, aggregate emissions continued to grow. However, the rate at which they grew fell in North America and Europe but went up in Asia, even though there was an increase in the share of companies setting targets in all three regions. The differences between regions indicate that aggregate emissions are more influenced by other causal variables (e.g., policy, offshoring, stakeholder pressure) than they are by corporate target-setting.</p>
