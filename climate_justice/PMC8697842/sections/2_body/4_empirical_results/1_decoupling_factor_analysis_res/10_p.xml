In 22 of 27 periods, Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decoupled from real income, whereas ecological footprint decoupled from real income only 18 times. Together with this, when the graphed trends are compared, an upward trend is observed in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income decoupling, which is a desirable result. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> illustrates a constant trend in ecological footprint and real income decoupling. Overall, we can conclude that real income was a more dominant influence on ecological footprint.</p>
