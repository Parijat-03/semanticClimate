<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One potential incentive to join action for those lacking time or financial resources could be the support system that is often created inside an activist group&#8212;something our study did not encourage. Our personal observations point to emotional and social benefits of participation. For example, when activists share values and struggles inside the activist space, they become empathetic with each other and can learn solidarity skills of mutual aid and support to overcome engagement obstacles. For example, they can cover each other's work shifts to allow one to go to a rally or help each other find jobs within activism or advocacy. These connections with other activists also lead to valuable professional networks. Accordingly, interventions might trigger more engagement by advertising these benefits or designing the intervention to foster these exchanges. We also recommend providing more event times that fit busy schedules, and specifically recruiting participants already interested or engaged in climate activism.</p>
