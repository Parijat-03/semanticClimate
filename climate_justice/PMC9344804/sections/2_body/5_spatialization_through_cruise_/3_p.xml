Rhythm can be observed in technical facilities, but also in bodily movements. Since 2009, a&#160;people mover has connected the VTP with Piazzale Roma, the main traffic junction for accessing the historic center from the mainland. In a&#160;three-minute ride, passengers floated over the unmaintained periphery of parking lots and construction sites before they arrived in Piazzale Roma. In a&#160;city where people move exclusively on foot or by water, and where distances covered on foot determine the sense of time, a&#160;cable railway was installed for the convenience of the cruise tourists&#8212;a&#160;means of transportation that is emblematic of the passivity and distant closeness often associated with cruise tourism (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The people mover connecting <italic>Stazione Marittima </italic>to<italic> Piazzale Roma</italic>, 2020 (photo by Janine Schemmer)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="48_2022_340_Fig3_HTML" id="d32e803"/></fig></p>
