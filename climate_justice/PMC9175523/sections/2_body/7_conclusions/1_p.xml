The contribution of the pillars is in underlining the linked&#160;triple-bottom-line nature of&#160;our current crises. These crises consist of ecological, social and environmental dimensions. It follows that adequate responses must also work across the domains of sustainability. While useful overview framings of these crises have been published, we argue that these have been too narrowly framed, overlooking important aspects in part. The five pillars presented here are informed by principles of distributive and procedural justice, recognizing the importance and advantages of real community engagement and empowerment and giving due respect and deference to the ecological carrying capacity of our fragile planet.</p>
