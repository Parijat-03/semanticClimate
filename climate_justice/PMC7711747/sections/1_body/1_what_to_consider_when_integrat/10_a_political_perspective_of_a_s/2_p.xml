<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par37">In the United States, there is a considerable difference between the probability of taking at least one climate-change related course at public research universities with Democrat-controlled state legislatures versus Republican or split-controlled state legislatures (Hess and Collins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>). The effects of politics trickle down into teacher and student readiness and belief in teaching and learning about climate change. Stevenson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>) note that a teacher&#8217;s belief that global warming is happening appears to predict a student&#8217;s belief.</p>
