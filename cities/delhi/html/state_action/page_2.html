India&#8217;s NAPCC released in 2008 outlines its strategy to meet the challenge of climate change. The Government of India through the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;CC) has directed each state to identify their Climate Change concerns and prepare an Action Plan to combat the local impacts and devise mitigation strategies, taking advantage of the various Missions of the NAPCC. The strategies thus required to be formulated as a part of the SAPCC are as per the state specific circumstances. The SAPCC of every state is required to formulate and prioritize financeable strategies and actions that can be made operational.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.93" top="577.41"><span x0="72.02" y0="577.41" x1="507.93" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 577.41; y1: 588.45; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">On 2 October 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement. India&#8216;s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets to lower the emissions intensity of GDP by 33% to 35% by 2030 below 2005 levels, to increase the share of non-fossil based power generation capacity to 40% of installed electric power capacity by 2030 (equivalent to 26&#8211;30% of generation in 2030), and to create an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5&#8211;3 billion tCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.79" top="494.73"><span x0="72.02" y0="494.73" x1="507.79" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 494.73; y1: 505.77; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">According to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have all increased since 1750 due to human activity. The deep interconnections between the vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change calls for expeditious coping strategies and response measures. Climate proofing of vulnerable sectors, programmes, natural systems and communities by integrating adaptation and mitigation options into planning processes and interventions are increasingly becoming an integral part of the development/environment lexicon and action worldwide. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.73" top="310.15"><span x0="72.02" y0="310.15" x1="507.73" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 310.15; y1: 321.19; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The climate response strategy of Delhi has key elements such as accelerating inclusive economic growth, promoting sustainable development, and safeguarding ecosystem services. Further, the strategy envisaged should not be viewed as a standalone action; instead it should be integrated into the regular developmental planning process. Similarly, while it is important to pursue both mitigation and adaptation measures, considering the overall socio-economic and ecological contexts and vulnerabilities, it would be of importance to give priority to adaptation options including Disaster Risk Reduction especially for State like Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.04" top="198.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="198.28" x1="508.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 198.28; y1: 209.32; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Department of Environment of the Government of NCT of Delhi acted as the State Nodal Agency for the preparation of SAPCC. The Delhi SAPCC integrates the action plan of Delhi with the ongoing and proposed developmental programmes in the state, and in tandem with the eight national missions along with the principles and guidelines listed out in the NAPCC. State Steering Committee under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary was constituted. Thereafter, the line departments dealing with the sectors sensitive to climate change constituted the seven sectoral Working Groups (WGs). The working group was represented by members from different relevant sectors/departments who contributed to the sectoral action plans prepared by the working group. These working groups were chaired by Chairman/ Secretary of the respective sector with a </span></div></body></html>
