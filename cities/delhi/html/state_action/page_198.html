The areas marked in the map above are sub-administrative districts. A common feature for all of these areas is their proximity to the River Yamuna. As mentioned in the sections above, these low lying areas are disproportionately sensitive to most of the impacts. This map could be improved significantly with the help of more detailed/current data, especially about the urban infrastructure (drainage/embankments) present in the low lying areas of Delhi. In addition to more detailed socio economic data, the study below attempts at drawing more detailed inferences. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.12" top="287.26"><span x0="72.02" y0="287.26" x1="526.12" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 287.26; y1: 299.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">As stated in the methodology, a combination of social capital, human capital, financial capital and physical capital is used to assess the adaptive capacity of the city of Delhi. These four are analyzed together to form the index of multiple depravity. The figure below describes the method of quantification for the four phenomena.  </span></div></body></html>
