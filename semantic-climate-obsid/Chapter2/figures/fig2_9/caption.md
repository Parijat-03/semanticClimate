Panel a: Regional GHG emission trends (in GtCO2eq yr-1) for the time period 1990-2019. GHG emissions from international aviation and shipping are not assigned to individual countries and shown separately. Panels b and c: Changes in GHG emissions for the 20 largest emitters (as of 2019) for the post-AR5 reporting period 2010-2019 in relative (% annual change) and absolute terms (GtCO2eq). Panels d and e: GHG emissions per capita and per GDP in 2019 for the 20 largest emitters (as of 2019). GDP estimated using constant international purchasing power parity (USD 2017). Emissions are converted into CO2-8 equivalents based on global warming potentials with a 100 year time horizon (GWP-100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al., 2021a). The yellow dots represent the emissions data from UNFCCC-CRFs (2021) that were accessed through GuÌˆtschow et al. (2021a). Net LULUCF CO2 emissions are included in panel a, based on the average of three bookkeeping models (see Section 2.2), but are excluded in panels b due to a lack of country resolution.
