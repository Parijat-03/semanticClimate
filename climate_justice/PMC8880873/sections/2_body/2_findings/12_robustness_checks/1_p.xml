Large metro areas might also be associated with features that aid wind energy development: better access to the electric grid, wealthier tribal members, and a denser local network of potential outside investors in tribal enterprises. Hence, in the robustness checks, we control for these dynamics. Specifically, we control for whether tribal lands are in a Metropolitan Statistical Area with more than one million residents, per the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
