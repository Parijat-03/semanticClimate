In particular, key gaps were identified in teaching on healthcare sustainability and climate justice.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These are missed opportunities for medical students to learn how to practice on a smaller carbon footprint and to care for patients experiencing health inequities exacerbated by climate change.</p>
