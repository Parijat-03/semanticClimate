Since the FGs were conducted online, this automatically affected how participants interacted. By creating certain group identities, we inevitably conditioned how the &#8216;politics&#8217; of geoengineering could be unpacked. This also could have created some invisibilities: for instance, to explore North/South inequalities, we could have invited participants from the Global South, and, although we attempted to invite situated publics, all of them were white and the majority had university level education. Although, through our interventions as social scientists, we attempted to &#8216;politicize&#8217; public engagement with geoengineering it is possible that, by replicating our FGs with the same research design, we could have obtained a different outcome.</p>
