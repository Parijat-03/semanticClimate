However, students both entered and left the course pessimistic about whether humans will successfully address climate change and became more worried about climate change after instruction. We argue that meaningfully increasing students' climate literacy requires not only increasing student knowledge, but also preparing and inspiring them to make use of that knowledge.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic" id="ece35736-blkfxd-0001" orientation="portrait"><graphic xlink:href="ECE3-9-12360-g009.jpg" position="anchor" id="nlm-graphic-1" orientation="portrait"/></boxed-text>
