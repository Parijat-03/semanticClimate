Precise monitoring of crop performance over the course of the growing season will enable farmers to economise on their inputs in terms of water, nutrients and pest management. Therefore, it can contribute to both the food security (by maintaining yields), sustainability (by reducing unnecessary inputs) and land sparing goals associated with SI. The site-specific management of weeds allows a&#160;more efficient application of herbicide to specific weed patches within crops (Jensen et al. 2012). Such precision weed control has resulted in herbicide savings of 19&#8211;22% for winter oilseed rape, 46&#8211;57% for sugar beet and 60&#8211;77% for winter wheat production (Gutjahr and Gerhards 2010). The use of on-farm sensors for real time management of crop and livestock performance can enhance farm efficiency (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman et al. 2014). Mapping soil nutrition status can allow for more targeted, and therefore more effective, nutrient management practices (Hedley 2015). Using wireless sensors to monitor environmental conditions, such as soil moisture, has the potential to allow more efficient crop irrigation (Srbinovska et al. 2015). Controlled traffic farming, where farm machinery is confined to permanent tracks, using automatic steering and satellite guidance, increases yields by minimising soil compaction. However, barriers to the uptake of many of these high-tech precision agriculture technologies remain. In what is described as the &#8216;implementation problem&#8217;, despite the potential to collect vast quantities of data on crop or livestock performance, applying these data to inform management decisions remains a&#160;challenge (Lindblom et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="202.58" top="183.17"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 183.17; y1: 192.67; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="183.17" x1="202.58">Low-tech precision agriculture </span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 171.17; y1: 180.67; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="171.17" x1="299.07">The principle of precision agriculture can be applied equally to low capital-input farming, in the form of low-tech precision agriculture (Conway 2013). The principle is the same, but instead of adopting capital-heavy equipment (such as sensor technology  connected to the &#8216;internet of things&#8217;, or large machinery and expensive inputs), farmers use knowledge and experience and re-purposed innovative approaches, such as a&#160;bottle cap as a&#160;fertiliser measure for each plant, applied by hand (Mondal and Basu 2009).

For example, the application of a&#160;simple seed priming technique resulted in a&#160;20 to 30% increase in yields of&#160;pearl millet and sorghum in semi-arid West Africa (Aune et al. 2017).

Where intensive land use has led to land degradation, more diverse land-use systems, such as intercropping, can provide a&#160;more sustainable land-use option with co-benefits for food security, adaptation and mitigation objectives. For example, in temperate regions, highly productive agricultural grasslands used to produce meat and dairy products are characterised by monoculture pastures with high agrochemical inputs. Multi-species grasslands may provide a&#160;route to SI, as even a&#160;modest increase in species richness in intensively managed grasslands can result in higher forage yields without increased inputs, such as chemical fertiliser (Finn et al. 2013; Sanderson et al. 2013; Tilman et al. 2011). Recent evidence also indicates multispecies grasslands have greater resilience to drought, indicating co-benefits for adaptation (Hofer et al. 2016; Haughey et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="337.89" right="485.88" top="219.15"><span style="x0: 337.89; x1: 343.87; y0: 219.15; y1: 228.65; width: 5.99; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="337.89" y0="219.15" x1="485.88">Diversification of production systems</span><span style="x0: 337.89; x1: 343.34; y0: 207.15; y1: 216.65; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="337.89" y0="207.15" x1="557.57">Agroforestry systems (see Glossary) can promote regional food security and provide many additional ecosystem services when compared with monoculture crop systems. Co-benefits for mitigation and adaptation include increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, improved water and nutrient use efficiency and the creation of favourable micro-climates (Waldron et al. 2017). Silvopasture systems, which combine grazing of livestock and forestry, are particularly useful in reducing land degradation where the risk of soil erosion is high (Murgueitio et al. 2011). Crop and livestock systems can also be combined to provide multiple services. Perennial wheat derivatives produced both high quality forage and substantial volumes of cereal grains </span></div></body></html>
