This phenomenon affects changes in the geographical distribution, seasonality, processes of pathogen transmission and the size of the population of autochthonous vectors, as well as the appearance of new vectors [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. For example, the presence of Aedes albopictus in southern Europe has provided opportunities for the introduction of Aedes mosquito-borne viruses via viraemic humans travelling from endemic regions. Outbreaks of dengue virus have been detected in the city of Nimes in southern France [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and of chikungunya virus in Italy, notably in the cities of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The best example of the emergence of viruses that have encouraged autochthonous mosquito-borne virus transmission in Europe is that of the West Nile virus, predominantly transmitted by mosquito species of the genus Culex [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Alteration of the complex and rich Mediterranean ecosystems may also contribute to increased vector circulation. Studies have reported the association of low bird diversity and increased human risk transmission of West Nile fever [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
