Utilising the decision-making tools and practices in Section&#160;7.5, policymakers operationalise anticipatory governance through a foresight system considering future scenarios and models, a networked system for integrating this knowledge into the policy process, a feedback system using indicators (Section&#160;7.5.5) to gauge performance, an open-minded institutional culture allowing for hybrid and polycentric governance (Fuerth and Faber 2013; Fuerth 2009). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="347.44" top="303.61"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 303.61; y1: 313.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="303.61" x1="347.44">There is </span><span style="x0: 347.61; x1: 352.19; y0: 303.61; y1: 313.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="347.61" y0="303.61" x1="405.83">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 406.0; x1: 408.81; y0: 303.61; y1: 313.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="406.0" y0="303.61" x1="566.07">that, in order to manage uncertainty, natural resource governance systems need to allow agencies and stakeholders to learn and change over time, responding to ecosystem changes and new information with different management strategies and practices that involve experimentation (Camacho 2009; Young 2017b). There is emerging literature on experimentation in governance surrounding climate change and land use (Kivimaa et al. 2017a) including policies such as REDD+ (Kaisa et al. 2017). Governance experiment literature could be in relation to scaling up policies from the local level for greater application, or downscaling policies addressing broad complex issues such as climate change, or addressing necessary change in social processes across sectors (such as water energy and food) (Laakso et al. 2017). Successful development of new policy instruments occurred in a governance experiment relating to coastal policy adapting to rising sea levels and extreme weather events through planned retreat (Rocle and Salles 2018). Experiments in emissions trading between 1968 and 2000 in the USA helped to realise speci&#64257;c models of governance and material practices through mutually supportive lab experiments and &#64257;eld applications that advanced collective knowledge (Vo&#223; and Simons&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="182.27" top="723.73"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.27; y0: 723.73; y1: 732.23; width: 4.56; font-size: 8.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="73.7" y0="723.73" x1="182.27">Cross-Chapter Box 12 (continued)</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.95" top="699.52"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 76.34; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="699.52" x1="551.95">(Cerutti et al. 2015).
