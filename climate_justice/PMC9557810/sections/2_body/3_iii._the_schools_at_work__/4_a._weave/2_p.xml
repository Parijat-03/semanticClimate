<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the <italic toggle="yes">Barrio Intercultural</italic> (Intercultural Neighbourhood) in the
south of Argentina, inter-learning spaces bring together diverse professions,
social identities, knowledges and practices in dialogue with each other.
Inter-learning, in this context, refers to a process whereby the intentional
juxtaposition of different, contrasting and complementary knowledges and
practices generates new forms of living and working together. This school
emerged from an alliance between <italic toggle="yes">Vecinos Sin Techo</italic> (Neighbours
without a Roof) and the Curruhuinca <italic toggle="yes">lof</italic> (community) of the
original Mapuche people in San Mart&#237;n de los Andes.<sup>(<xref rid="fn22-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">22</xref>)</sup> Initially unified by their
common need for housing, over time the development of their Intercultural
Neighbourhood became a means to coexist in a common place rooted in the
cosmovision (or worldview) of <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;buen vivir&#8221;</italic>. As argued by
Eduardo Gudynas, this cosmovision embodies community-centric, ecologically
balanced and culturally sensitive conviviality.<sup>(<xref rid="fn23-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">23</xref>)</sup> It encapsulates
perspectives that are a far cry from market-led approaches to housing, land and
services and seeks to build new forms of public coexistence, in diversity and in
harmony with nature. In this experience and across those of other schools,
weaving is the key pedagogic practice that crafts a new material and social
fabric by interlacing threads of collective dreams, rights and aspirations.</p>
