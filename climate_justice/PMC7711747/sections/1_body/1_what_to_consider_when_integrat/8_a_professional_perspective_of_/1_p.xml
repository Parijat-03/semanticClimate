Teachers are an essential pillar in CCE, for they are directly responsible for the teaching and learning process. There is plenty of literature on the impact of teacher-student relationships in the classroom (Forbes and Zint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Roorda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>; Garc&#237;a Bacete et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>), as well as the importance of teachers as role models for the development of environmental literacy (Rickinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2001</xref>; Stern et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>).</p>
