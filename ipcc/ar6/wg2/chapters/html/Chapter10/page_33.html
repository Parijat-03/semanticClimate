It is noteworthy that India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and China together account for more than 50% of the world&#8217;s groundwater withdrawals (Scott et&#160;al., 2019). A study conducted in the Shahpur and Maner districts of Bihar, India, in which drinking water sourced from the groundwater of 388 households was tested, showed that 70&#8211;90% of the sampled household&#8217;s drinking water contained either arsenic or iron, or both (Thakur and Gupta, 2019). Given the nexus between CIDs and non-climate drivers, an effective adaptation to the impacts of climate change would also demand sustainable development and management of shared aquifer resources, which in turn require reliable TBA inventories and improved knowledge production and knowledge sharing on the shared groundwater systems (Lee et&#160;al., 2018a).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.73" top="294.63"><span x0="54.14" y0="294.63" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 294.63; y1: 304.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A study of peri-urban spaces involving four South Asian cities, Khulna (Bangladesh) (Pervin et&#160;al., 2020), Gurugram and Hyderabad (India), and Kathmandu (Nepal), has shown the nexus between intensifying use and deteriorating quality of water and the&#160;impact of climate change, resulting in peri-urban water insecurity and conflict (Roth et&#160;al., 2019). The challenge of ensuring access to water resources and their (re)allocation and prioritisation for marginalised communities remains on the agenda of policy-oriented interdisciplinary research and demands effective implementation of its findings at the grassroots level by the administrative agencies. Taking water security as a key CCA goal at the urban-city scale of Bangkok, a study (Babel et&#160;al., 2020) has shown the usefulness of a generic framework with 5 dimensions, 12 indicators and a set of potential variables to support national-level initiatives and plans in diverse climatic and socioeconomic conditions across various sub-regions of Asia.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="102.65"><span x0="54.14" y0="102.65" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 56.44; y0: 102.65; y1: 112.15; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the Kathmandu valley in Nepal, where groundwater resources are under immense pressure from multiple stresses, including overextraction and climate change, mapping groundwater resilience to climate change has been demonstrated as a useful tool to understand the dynamics of groundwater systems, and thereby facilitate the development of </span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.77" top="486.66"><span x0="318.18" y0="486.66" x1="571.77" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 321.7; y0: 486.66; y1: 496.16; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">strategies for sustainable groundwater management (Shrestha et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.73" top="450.66"><span x0="318.18" y0="450.66" x1="571.73" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 320.48; y0: 450.66; y1: 460.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the Mekong Delta, the groundwater storage is projected to decline by more than 120 and 160&#160;million m</span><span x0="436.3" y0="442.76" x1="438.96" style="x0: 436.3; x1: 438.96; y0: 442.76; y1: 448.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">3</span><span x0="440.8" y0="438.6" x1="571.76" style="x0: 440.8; x1: 445.38; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of the 21st century, in conjunction with land subsidence and SLR. This in turn calls for proactive planning and implementation of adaptation strategies that address multiple stresses in order to ensure sustainable utilisation of groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta in the context of future climatic conditions and associated uncertainties (Wang et&#160;al., 2021a). Proposed CCA strategies for the Mekong River basin include a better understanding of the complex linkages between climate change, technological interventions, land-use change, water-use change and socioeconomic developments both in the upstream and downstream riparian countries (Evers and Pathirana, 2018).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.76" top="282.62"><span x0="318.19" y0="282.62" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 325.75; y0: 282.62; y1: 292.12; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">While South Asian countries have done well in attaining Goal 6 of Sustaining Development Goals, access to safe and clean drinking water remains a challenge. Taking Indian rivers as an example, it is suggested that participatory river protection and&#160;rehabilitation, based on comprehensive knowledge of the river-system dynamics, and local awareness at the community level, may act as a multiplier for river conservation measures (Nandi et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.75" top="186.63"><span x0="318.19" y0="186.63" x1="571.75" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 186.63; y1: 196.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Hydroclimatic extremes in the HKH region could adversely impact the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna basins (Wijngaard et&#160;al., 2017; Acharya and Prakash, 2019). Studies have recommended watershed or basin analysis to address the challenge of adaptation&#160;in urban spaces (Lele et&#160;al., 2018). A study of northern Bangladesh that focused on encouraging traditional ways of cultivation suggests that rural women have Indigenous knowledge and their participation can play a useful role (Kanak Pervez et&#160;al., 2015). The knowledge pertains to agriculture, soil conservation, fish and animal production, irrigation and water conservation. There has also been a focus on gendered construction of local flood-forecasting knowledge in rural communities in India living in the Gandak River&#160;basin (Acharya and Prakash, 2019). </span></div><div left="68.68" right="537.81" top="713.98"><span style="x0: 68.68; x1: 75.36; y0: 713.98; y1: 725.98; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="68.68" y0="713.98" x1="537.81">Box&#160;10.4 | Case Study on Climate Vulnerability and Cross-Boundary Adaptation in Central Asia</span></div><div left="68.68" right="558.19" top="690.6"><span x0="68.68" y0="690.6" x1="558.19" style="x0: 68.68; x1: 70.98; y0: 690.6; y1: 700.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In Central Asia, water scarcity has been ranked in the top five global risks (Gleick, 1993; Zhupankhan et&#160;al., 2018). Cross-boundary adaptation remains critically important in this region with abundant glaciers in the Pamir Plateau of Tajikistan (Hu et&#160;al., 2017) and areas with severe glacier retreat in the Tianshan Mountains (Liu and Liu, 2015). The spatial variations of glacier and other climate variables have added to uncertainty related to the dynamic of the water cycle. The headwater regions, such as Pamir area, would be significantly affected by the climate parameters, such as the stronger rainfall intensity, more frequent rainfall and higher temperature (Luo et&#160;al., 2019). The water resources in the Pamir Plateau will range from &#8722;0.48 to 5.6% (Gulakhmadov et&#160;al., 2020), and the crop phenological period in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will be about 1&#8211;2&#160;weeks earlier. The threat of agricultural water stress is increasing as well. The oasis in downstream areas will face more complex water resource fluctuations, water crisis and desertification. In particular, rain-fed agriculture in northern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and western Turkmenistan is particularly dependent on water resources.

High-efficiency water-saving technology will help the upstream and downstream water resource management in Central Asian countries to adapt to the variation in water resources quantity, frequency and spatial pattern.</span></div></body></html>
