Continued inaction reduces the future policy option space,\ndampens economic growth and increases the challenges of mitigation as well as adaptation (Moore and Diaz 2015; Luderer et al.\n2013). The cost of reducing emissions is estimated to be considerably less than the costs of the damages at all levels (Kainuma\net al. 2013; Moran 2011; S&#225;nchez and Maseda 2016).</td>

      <td>The costs of adapting to climate impacts are also projected to be substantial, although evidence is limited (summarised in Chambwera\net al. 2014a). Estimates range from 9 to 166 billion USD per year at various scales and types of adaptation, from capacity building\nto specific projects (Fankhauser 2017). There is insufficient literature about the costs of adaptation in the agriculture or land-based\nsectors (Wreford and Renwick 2012) due to lack of baselines, uncertainty around biological relationships and inherent uncertainty about\nanticipated avoided damage estimates, but economic appraisal of actions to maintain the functions of the natural environment and\nland sector generate positive net present values (Adaptation Sub-committee 2013).</td>

SLM practices reverse or minimise economic losses of land degradation, estimated at between 6.3 and\n10.6 trillion USD annually, (ELD Initiative 2015) more than five times the entire value of agriculture in the market economy (Costanza\net al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2017; Sandifer et al. 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2013) (Section 3.7.5).</td>
