<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">If students enter their science courses already accepting climate change, our courses may often be preaching to the choir&#8212;but that does not mean instruction has no effect or value. After instruction, participants became more certain that climate change is happening, that humans are primarily responsible, and that there is a strong scientific consensus that climate change is happening and caused by people&#8212;findings broadly consistent with earlier studies (e.g., Holthuis et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, considering that participants already accepted that climate change is happening when they entered the course, class time might be better devoted to more advanced or nuanced topics&#8212;topics that take the realities of climate change as their starting premise, and that build on, extend, and add meaningful complexity to student understandings.</p>
