a) trends of GHG emissions by subsectors 1990–2019, 

b) share of total sector and per capita GHG emissions by world region in 2019, and 

c) Kaya decomposition of GHG emissions drivers Based on the equation H=P(A/P)(L/A)(H/L), where P is population, A/P is agricultural output per capita, L/A is the land required per unit of agricultural output (land efficiency), and H/L is GHG emissions per unit of land (GHG intensity) (Hong et al., 2021). GHG emissions H comprise agricultural CH4 and N2O emissions from EDGAR v6.0. The indicated annual growth rates are averaged across the years 2010–2019 (LULUCF CO2 emissions are excluded in panel c). (Note: due to different datasets, the population breakdown for AFOLU emissions is slightly different than that in the other sector figures above).
