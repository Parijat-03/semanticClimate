<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0080">There are, however, other reasons over and beyond the link to virtue ethics for why transport justice research has drawn on Capability Approaches (CAs). Most significant here is that a resource such as accessibility, or even mobility understood as the ease of moving through physical space, cannot duly account for the diversity in needs, aspirations, and abilities (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying point here is, firstly, that accessibility, mobility, and transport are not ends in and of themselves, but means to ends that are achieved through the activities undertaken across space and time that movement enables. Moreover, and secondly, the ability to convert or appropriate accessibility and mobility into actual movement and activities depends on a whole range of other factors and processes, sometimes denoted as &#8216;conversion factors&#8217; in CAs (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Robeyns, 2017</xref>; see also <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). This an important point for thinking about transport justice: having access to a bus, a bike, or a healthcare centres is not particularly helpful if you don't know how to read a timetable, don't cycle because you feel it is too unsafe, or can't negotiate the stairs or ramp at the entrance of the clinic. A &#8216;resource&#8217; in the abstract is not necessarily enabling every person in a particular situation.</p>
