Climate change is considered the greatest health threat of this century, although it is difficult to precisely estimate the magnitude and timing of some of its health impacts. These will depend, in part, on the major effort towards decarbonisation required to achieve the goals of international treaties such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, even with such major effort, adaptation to a warmer, more variable climate will be needed. Consequently, a growing number of national, regional and local governments have declared a &#8220;climate emergency&#8221;; this formal step has prompted commitment to develop action plans tackling the causes of climate change, and incorporating measures to accelerate adaptation to extreme weather events to reduce their short- and long-term effects [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
