Glaciers in Ladakh, largely located at&#160;5,000&#8211;6,000&#160;m a.s.l. and small in size have retreated at least since the late 1960s although less pronounced than in many other&#160;Himalayan&#160;regions (Chudley et al., 2017; Schmidt and N&#252;sser, 2017). However, the effect of glaciers on stream&#64258;ow in&#160;Ladakh&#160;is&#160;poorly constrained, and measurements on changes in runoff and snow cover are lacking (N&#252;sser et al., 2018).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.93" top="615.53"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 615.53; y1: 625.03; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="615.53" x1="551.93">To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for irrigation, villagers in the region have developed four types of arti&#64257;cial ice reservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in&#160;the autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and &#64258;ows down to &#64257;elds (Clouse et al., 2017; N&#252;sser et al., 2018). In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual &#64258;ow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased &#64258;ow in the following spring (Vince, 2009; Shaheen, 2016). Frozen basins are formed from water which is conveyed across a slope through channels and check dams to shaded surface depressions near the villages. Cascades and diversions direct water to&#160;pass over stone walls, slowing its movement and allowing it to freeze. Ice stupas direct water through pipes into fountains, where&#160;it freezes into conical shapes (Box&#160;2.3 Figure&#160;1). These techniques use local materials and draw on local knowledge (N&#252;sser and Baghel, 2016). </span></div><div left="73.18" right="551.95" top="507.55"><span style="x0: 73.18; x1: 78.63; y0: 507.55; y1: 517.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.18" y0="507.55" x1="551.95">A study examined 14 ice reservoirs, including ice stupas, and concluded that they serve as &#8216;site-speci&#64257;c water conservation strategies; and that they can be regarded as appropriate local technologies to reduce seasonal water scarcity at critical times (N&#252;sser et al., 2018). It listed the bene&#64257;ts of ice reservoirs as improved water availability in spring, reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting crop failure risks, and the possibility of growing cash crops. However, the study questioned their usefulness as a long-term adaptation strategy, because their operation depends on winter runoff and freeze-thaw cycles, both of which are sensitive to interannual variability, and often deviate from the optimum range required for effective functioning of the reservoirs. It&#160;also raised questions about the &#64257;nancial costs and labour requirements, which vary across the four types of ice reservoirs.</span></div><div left="73.7" right="139.48" top="123.83"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.15; y0: 123.83; y1: 131.83; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLHNB+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="123.83" x1="139.48">Box&#160;2.3, Figure&#160;1 |&#160;  </span><span style="x0: 139.48; x1: 141.25; y0: 123.77; y1: 131.77; width: 1.78; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLHOD+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="139.48" y0="123.77" x1="282.4">Ice stupas in Ladakh, India (Photo: Padma Rigzin)</span></div></body></html>
