<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We asked the participants whether they are thankful for their privileges in the climate crisis (6-point scale; 1 = &#8220;totally disagree&#8221;, 6 = &#8220;totally agree&#8221;). The two items were: &#8220;I am grateful to live in a region of the world where climate change will arrive later and less extreme than in other regions&#8221; and &#8220;I am grateful to belong to a generation that is even less affected by climate change than future generations.&#8221; Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; was acceptable (0.78). The items can also be found in <xref rid="S10.SS3" ref-type="sec">Appendix C</xref>.</p>
