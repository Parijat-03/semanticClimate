If even 25% of this could be harvested it would imply availability of 625 MLD, which would be nearly equivalent to the presently estimated deficiency. This is in addition to the potential for roof water harvesting assessed at around 27 MLD. For example, DMRC has installed Rain water harvesting systems at 151 stations having a pit capacity of 9,210 cum. In viaducts, 789 rain water harvesting pits have been installed with a capacity of 2,787 cum.

Due to increase in urbanization and reduction of rural areas, run off increased considerably thereby necessitating review of existing drainage system. To overcome Water logging problems, to revive water bodies, recharge ground water storage and design for proper drainage system in the city the job was entrusted to this department.
