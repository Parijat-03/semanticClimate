<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We propose that these more critical, socially conscious, and agentic approaches to scientific literacy are models of <italic>writerly climate literacy</italic>, a term we use to denote not just a cognitive readiness to interpret, assess, and write scientific content, but also a strategic, evidence&#8208;backed sense of efficacy toward climate action: a broader affective, social, and intellectual readiness to act on knowledge about climate, translating and recomposing what is learned in the classroom into socially and scientifically conscious action beyond the classroom. Even if our courses impart a climate&#8208;related &#8220;functional scientific literacy&#8221; (Zeidler &amp; Newton, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) that &#8220;moves beyond retention of scientific fact&#8221; to contemplate the ethical stakes and social consequences of (not) acting on those facts (p. 60), such climate literacy may not amount to much if students <italic>also</italic> are too discouraged, disengaged, or overwhelmed to put it into practice. A sense of efficacy and motivation to act are core components of writerly climate literacy, distinguishing it from more readerly engagements with climate knowledge. If the goal of introductory science coursework is to promote the rich, multidimensional kind of climate literacy outlined by the US Global Change Research Program (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), there is good reason for science educators to expand their attention from climate knowledge alone to also include students' assumptions and feelings about climate change&#8212;and about how to respond to it.</p>
