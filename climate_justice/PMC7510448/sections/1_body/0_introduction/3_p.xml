Numerous studies of inequality have shown how those who benefit from the economic processes that underlie global environmental degradation pass on the risks and burden of environmental externalities to humanity at large or to future generations (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Okereke et&#160;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hailemariam et&#160;al., 2019</xref>). Sustainability scholars have addressed questions of distributive, representative, procedural, or intergenerational justice, including recent calls for new conceptualizations of &#8220;planetary justice&#8221; (e.g., <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Biermann and Kalfagianni, 2020</xref>). And yet, often this literature stays at the level of ideal conceptions and abstract arguments drawing on normative theories of justice. What is missing&#8212;and this is our main point here&#8212;is a clearly articulated pro-poor focus within diverse and often abstract conceptions of planetary justice.</p>
