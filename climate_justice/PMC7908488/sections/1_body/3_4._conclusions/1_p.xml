<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our in-depth analysis identifies large and consistent variations often 2.2&#8211;3.9 &#176;C (4&#8211;7 &#176;F) between neighborhoods of different class and racial composition within Southwestern U.S. urban regions. Although previous literature has documented thermal inequities elsewhere, we examined the largest number of urban regions at the most detailed scale to date under both day- and nighttime temperature scenarios. On both average and extreme heat days, low-income neighborhoods of the Southwestern U.S. urban regions experience temperatures that are 3.9 &#176;C (7 &#176;F) higher in some cases and nearly 2.2 &#176;C (4 &#176;F) higher on average than those experienced by wealthy neighborhoods. The pattern is similar for neighborhoods with different levels of Latinx population. Income has a statistically significant relationship with average daytime heat, extreme heat, and average nighttime heat. This trend is present in 56 of the 59 spatial error models that we ran. The same significance holds in regards to Latinx population. We found thermal inequalities to be most stark in California, perhaps because of greater amounts of irrigated landscape and agriculture as well as geographical factors mentioned earlier. Our in-depth analysis highlights the extent of these disparities under summer daytime, nighttime, and extreme heat scenarios within 20 dryland urban regions at particular risk of high heat. We also looked specifically at percent Latinx, a marginalized group throughout the Southwestern United States. We also utilized a spatial error model to account for spatial autocorrelation, which was prevalent in our biophysical and sociodemographic variables. Finally, although we presented results in majority dryland cities, we also included the humid cities of Houston and Dallas.</p>
