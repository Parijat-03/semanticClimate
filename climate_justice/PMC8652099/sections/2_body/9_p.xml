We are in the midst of a climate crisis that is linked to every realm of our life and civilization. The clock is ticking fast and this may be our last chance to keep global temperatures in check and prevent the impacts of catastrophic events due to climate change. We need to build tighter deadlines and resolutions to make up the outcomes of COP26. It is high time to give certainty to the approaches that have been promised in support of mitigation and adaptation strategies. This can be achieved only when every nation steps in and commitments towards environment and nature are fulfilled.</p>
