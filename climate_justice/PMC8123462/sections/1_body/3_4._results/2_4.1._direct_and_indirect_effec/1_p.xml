It is recognized that the climate crisis is one of the greatest human rights challenges of our time and spans the right to life, health, food, water, housing security, and the rights of Indigenous peoples. Climate change also compounds and magnifies existing inequities and does so in both direct and indirect ways as climate events vary across temporal and spatial scales and range in their severity.</p>
