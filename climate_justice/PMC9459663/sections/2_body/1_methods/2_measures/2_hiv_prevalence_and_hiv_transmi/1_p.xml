Among participants with discordant results on the ELISA tests, a new ELISA or Western Blot test is performed. All participants receive education materials and referrals for free counseling and testing. We considered additional outcomes selected before analysis, each representing a different dimension of HIV transmission risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> These outcomes included a binary indicator representing whether the respondent reported an STI in the 12 months before the survey date<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and a count of the number of sexual partners the respondent reported (other than the respondent&#8217;s spouse) over the previous 12 months. These DHS questions are consistent with standard indicators recommended for monitoring sexual activity in the context of HIV/AIDS programs.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Similar self-reported sexual activity questions have demonstrated good validity and test-retest reliability.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220857r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220857r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220857r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
