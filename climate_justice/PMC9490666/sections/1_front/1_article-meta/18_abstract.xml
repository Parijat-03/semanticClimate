As humanity reckons with the emergency of climate change, our global health community needs to contend with our own contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. We know that transformation is possible and that climate action is the antidote to the existential challenge. As a global health community, we have an immense opportunity, responsibility, and commitment to lead, support, inspire, and empower climate action, research, and innovation that align deeply with our mission and core values.</p></abstract>
