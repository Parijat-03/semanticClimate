However, although climate change is a global phenomenon, its determinants, its environmental and social consequences, and its impacts on the health and well-being of populations vary dramatically. For this reason, no framework can be applied to all possible social, economic, environmental and political settings [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
