<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Relative extreme events were identified based on local thresholds derived from historically observed heat extremes. Historical Tmax and Tmin data provide a place-relevant snapshot of extreme heat that can be used as a reference for assessing future risk. Rather than follow the heat wave and extreme heat day definitions provided by the default on Cal-Adapt, we adopted a commonly applied approach that uses more health-relevant thresholds: a heat-wave threshold at the 95<sup>th</sup> historical percentile with a two day duration window [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A minimum and a maximum historical extreme heat threshold was calculated for each census tract by finding the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile over the historical period for daily Tmax and Tmin values.</p>
