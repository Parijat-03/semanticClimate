Snowpack models and related processes are 2 being further improved by several research groups around the world for better future projections. The new 3 generation of Earth system models, such as CESM2 (included in CMIP6), have been updated with improved 4 snow-layer scheme to represent better polar conditions (Lenaerts et al., 2016). Surface melting is still 5 considerably overestimated in CESM2 compared to RCMs and satellite products, because of the reduced 6 potential for refreezing and overestimation of the net energy available for melt (Trusel et al., 2015; Lenaerts 7 et al., 2016). This emphasizes the need for better snow-melt parameterizations and representation of 8 feedback processes such as melt-albedo and cloud radiative forcing. 9 10 Assimilation of observations in reanalysis products yield realistic temperature patterns and seasonal 11 variations, with the newest dataset (ERA5 reanalysis) performing the best. The reanalyses&#8217; ability to simulate 12 precipitation and the surface mass balance is more variable, and they generally overestimate the surface mass 13 balance, except for ERA5 which shows an underestimation and the lowest bias (Gossart et al., 2019), but are 14 well suited to provide atmospheric and sea-surface boundary conditions to drive RCMs. 15 16 Gorte et al. (submitted) selected a subset of the top 10th percentile of models, when compared to ice-core 17 reconstructions from Medley and Thomas (2019), from both the CMIP5 and currently released CMIP6 18 models. The resulting refined projections for the surface mass balance integrated over the entire Antarctic ice 19 sheet during the 2000&#8211;2100 period for RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 are 2295&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1222&#8201;Gt, 2382&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1316&#8201;Gt, and 20 2648&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1530&#8201;Gt per year respectively.  21 22 To date, published studies of higher-resolution hindcast RCM simulations covering mainly Antarctica are 23 limited to a few model simulations with a grid spacing of 12 to 50 km, and including RACMO2 (van 24 Wessem et al., 2018), MAR (Agosta et al., 2019), COSMO-CLM2 (Souverijns et al., 2019), HIRHAM5 25 (Lucas-Picher et al., 2012), and MetUM (Walters et al., 2017; Mottram et al., submitted). These models are 26 typically forced by reanalysis products such as ERA-Interim, and their simulations agree reasonably well 27 with available measurements of temperature, surface melt, and surface mass balance, including the coast-to-28 plateau surface mass balance gradients (see Figure Atlas.46:). These studies also often highlight important 29 processes that are sometimes missing or under-represented in the models, such as drifting-snow transport 30 (Agosta et al., 2019) and cloud-precipitation microphysical processes (van Wessem et al., 2018). Other 31 studies using regional climate models have employed much finer grid spacings of around 5 km to run 32 successful hindcast climate simulations of particular regions of Antarctica, such as the Antarctic Peninsula 33 using MAR and RACMO2 models (Datta et al., 2018; van Wessem et al., 2018) and West Antarctica using 34 the RACMO2 and/or MAR models (Lenaerts et al., 2018; Donat-Magnin et al., 2019) and the Weddell Sea 35 region using the CCLM model (Zentek, R. and Heinemann, 2019).

In particular, despite MAR and RACMO2 simulating the 45 coast-to-plateau surface-mass-balance gradient well, comparison of the simulated surface mass balance with 46 observations also highlighted the importance of drifting-snow transport that is not included in MAR and is 47 underestimated in RACMO2, suggesting a need to simulate better and constrain drifting-snow fluxes in 48 climate models. 49 50 Using non-hydrostatic regional models, such as Polar-WRF (Grosvenor et al., 2014; Elvidge et al., 2015; 51 Elvidge and Renfrew, 2016; King et al., 2017; Hines et al., 2019; Vignon et al., 2019) or HARMONIE-52 AROME (Mottram et al., 2017) up to finer resolutions approaching 2 km, could solve remaining 53 discrepancies in RCM simulations, but are still often unable to resolve accurately the relevant feedbacks and 54 foehn processes (Turton et al., 2017; Bozkurt et al., 2018). 55 </span></div></body></html>
