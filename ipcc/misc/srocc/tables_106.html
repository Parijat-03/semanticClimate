      <td>(Pradhan et al. 2013, 2014; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018b; Seneviratne et al. 2018; Vuuren et al. 2018). These scenarios\nprovide useful thought experiments, but the feasibility of achieving the stylised assumptions is often unknown. Shock scenarios\nexplore the consequences of low probability, high-impact events such as pandemic diseases, cyber-attacks and failures in food supply\nchains (Challinor et al. 2018), often in food security studies. Because of the diversity of exploratory scenarios, attempts have been\nmade to categorise them into &#8216;archetypes&#8217; based on the similarity between their assumptions in order to facilitate communication\n(IPBES 2018a).\nConditional probabilistic futures explore the consequences of model parameter uncertainty in which these uncertainties are conditional\non scenario assumptions (Neill 2004). Only a few studies have applied the conditional probabilistic approach to land-use futures\n(Brown et al. 2014; Engstrom et al. 2016; Henry et al. 2018). By accounting for uncertainties in key drivers these studies show large\nranges in land-use change, for example, global cropland areas of 893&#8211;2380 Mha by the end of the 21st century (Engstrom et al. 2016).\nThey also find that land-use targets may not be achieved, even across a wide range of scenario parameter settings, because of\ntrade-offs arising from the competition for land (Henry et al. 2018; Heck et al. 2018). Accounting for uncertainties across scenario\nassumptions can lead to convergent outcomes for land-use change, which implies that certain outcomes are more robust across\na wide range of uncertain scenario assumptions (Brown et al. 2014).\nIn addition to global scale scenario studies, sub-national studies demonstrate that regional climate change impacts on the land system\nare highly variable geographically because of differences in the spatial patterns of both climate and socio-economic change (Harrison\net al. 2014). Moreover, the capacity to adapt to these impacts is strongly dependent on the regional, socio-economic context and\ncoping capacity (Dunford et al. 2014); processes that are difficult to capture in global scale scenarios. Regional scenarios are often\nco-created with stakeholders through participatory approaches (Kok et al. 2014), which are powerful in reflecting diverse worldviews\nand stakeholder values. Stakeholder participatory methods provide additional richness and context to storylines, as well as providing\nsalience and legitimacy for local stakeholders (Kok et al. 2014).\nCross-Chapter Box 1, Table 1 | Description of the principal methods used in land and climate futures analysis.\nExamples\nDescription\nFutures method Application domain Time horizon in this\nand subtypes\nassessment\nClimate system, land system and other components of\nLong-term projections quantified 2.3, 2.6.2, 5.2.3,\nthe environment (e.g., biodiversity, ecosystem function- 10&#8211;100 years\nwith models 6.1.4, 6.4.4, 7.2\ning, water resources and quality), for example the SSPs\nA continuation into the future of current trends\nBusiness-as-usual scenarios 5&#8211;10 years, 20&#8211;30 years 1.2.1, 2.6.2, 5.3.4,\nin key drivers to explore the consequences of these\n(including &#8216;outlooks&#8217;) for outlooks 6.1.4\nin the near term\nExploratory scenarios.\nTrajectories of change Ex ante analysis of the consequences of alternative\nPolicy and planning scenarios 2.6.3, 5.5.2, 5.6.2,\nin system components policies or decisions based on known policy options 5&#8211;30 years\n(including business planning) 6.4.4\nfrom the present to or already implemented policy and planning measures\ncontrasting, alterna- Afforestation/reforestation areas, bioenergy areas, 2.6.1, 5.5.1, 5.5.2,\nStylised scenarios (with single\ntive futures based on protected areas for conservation, consumption patterns 10&#8211;100 years 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 6.4.4,\nand multiple options)\nplausible and internally (e.g., diets, food waste) 7.2\nconsistent assumptions\nNear-term events\nabout the underlying\nShock scenarios (high impact Food supply chain collapses, cyberattacks, pandemic (up to 10 years) leading\ndrivers of change 5.8.1\nsingle events) diseases (humans, crops and livestock) to long-term impacts\n(10&#8211;100 years)\nConditional probabilistic futures\nWhere some knowledge is known about driver\nascribe probabilities to uncertain\nuncertainties, for example, population, economic 10&#8211;100 years 1.2\ndrivers that are conditional on\ngrowth, land-use change\nscenario assumptions\nEnvironmental quality, societal development, human\nVisions, goal-seeking or 5&#8211;10 years to 2.6.2, 6.4.4, 7.2,\nNormative scenarios. well-being, the Representative Concentration Pathways\ntarget-seeking scenarios 10&#8211;100 years 5.5.2\nDesired futures or (RCPs,) 1.5&#176;C scenarios\noutcomes that are Pathways as alternative sets\naspirational and of choices, actions or behaviours 5&#8211;10 years to\nSocio-economic systems, governance and policy actions 5.5.2, 6.4.4, 7.2\nhow to achieve them that lead to a future vision 10&#8211;100 years\n(goal or target)</td>
