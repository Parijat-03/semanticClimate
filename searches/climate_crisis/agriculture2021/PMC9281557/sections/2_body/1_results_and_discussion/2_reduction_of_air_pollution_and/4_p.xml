<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0050">The life of every child born today is affected by changes in contemporary climate induced by global warming. The climate crisis is not a virus, but manifests itself in other extreme atmospheric phenomena such as floods and droughts, and intensifies and complicates other issues, such as air pollution. A consequence of the coronavirus pandemic was a sharp drop in atmospheric emissions due to the cessation of industrial activities and reduced use of transportation modes (automobiles, trucks, buses, airplanes, ships, and trains). The data indicate that the coronavirus lockdown may have saved the lives of 4000 children under the age of 5 and 73,000 adults over 70 in China alone by reducing pollution.<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>
