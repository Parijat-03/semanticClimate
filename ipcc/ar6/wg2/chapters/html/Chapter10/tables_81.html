      <td>Despite these challenges, there are increasing examples of actions across Asia that are meeting climate adaptation\ngoals and SDGs simultaneously, such as through climate-smart agriculture, disaster risk management and NbS. To\nenable these system transitions, vertical and horizontal policy linkages, active communication and cooperation\nbetween multiple stakeholders, and attention to the root causes of vulnerability are essential. Furthermore, rapid\nsystemic transformation can be enabled by policies and finances to incentivise capacity building, new technological\ninnovation and diffusion. The effectiveness of such technology-centred approaches can be maximised by combining\nthem with attention to behavioural shifts such as by improving education and awareness, building local capacities</td>
