Through this installation, everyday knowledge and experiences (related to sexuality and sexual practices) that are present in life, alongside interests and concerns of teenagers, are combined with disciplinary knowledge (present in the voices of educators and the exhibit contents). The dialogue opportunity that takes place at the end of the visit, and the sharing of understandings and lived experiences, allow for new literacies and narratives to emerge. In/through this exhibition, we see wisdom, different practices, experiences, and knowledge intersecting (potentially) beyond the science museum space.</p>
