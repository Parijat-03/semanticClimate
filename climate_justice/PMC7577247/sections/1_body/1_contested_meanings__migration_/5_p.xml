<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0050">Furthermore, several international agencies suggest climate-induced displacement is on the rise. In 2017 alone, 18.8 million people in 135 countries were displaced by sudden-onset weather events such as flooding and tropical storms (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">IDMC, 2018</xref>). Other displacements have been caused by slow-onset events such as drought, desertification, shifting rain patterns, erosion, and SLR (<xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Hauer, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Heslin et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2020</xref>). If these patterns continue, the questions will not be whether people will move but about how, where, and under what circumstances will they move &#8211; through climate-migration or managed retreat? This also raises critical questions about the responsibility of nation states and international organizations to protect human population from climate-induced displacements.</p>
