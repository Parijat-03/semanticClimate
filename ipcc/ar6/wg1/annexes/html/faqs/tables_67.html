      <td>A climatic impact-driver is a physical climate condition that directly affects society or ecosystems. Climatic impact-\ndrivers may represent a long-term average condition (such as the average winter temperatures that affect indoor\nheating requirements), a common event (such as a frost that kills off warm-season plants), or an extreme event\n(such as a coastal flood that destroys homes). A single climatic impact-driver may lead to detrimental effects\nfor one part of society while benefiting another, while others are not affected at all. A climatic impact-driver\n(or its change caused by climate change) is therefore not universally hazardous or beneficial, but we refer to it</td>

These climatic\nimpact-drivers (CIDs) are formally defined in this Report as &#8216;physical climate system conditions (e.g., means,\nevents, extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and\ntheir changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements\nand regions&#8217;. Because people, infrastructure and ecosystems interact directly with their immediate environment,\nclimate experts assess CIDs locally and regionally. CIDs may relate to temperature, the water cycle, wind and\nstorms, snow and ice, oceanic and coastal processes or the chemistry and energy balance of the climate system.\nFuture impacts and risk may also be directly affected by factors unrelated to the climate (such as socio-economic</td>

Some CIDs focus on aspects of the average climate (such as the seasonal\nprogression of temperature and precipitation, average winds or the chemistry of the ocean) that determine,\nfor example, species distribution, farming systems, the location of tourist resorts, the availability of water\nresources and the expected heating and cooling needs for buildings in an average year. CIDs also include\ncommon episodic events that are particularly important to systems, such as thaw events that can trigger the\ndevelopment of plants in spring, cold spells that are important for fruit crop chill requirements, or frost events\nthat eliminate summer vegetation as winter sets in. Finally, CIDs include many extreme events connected to\nimpacts such as hailstorms that damage vehicles, coastal floods that destroy shoreline property, tornadoes that\ndamage infrastructure, droughts that increase competition for water resources, and heatwaves that can strain</td>

The length of the season with snow on the ground\nis just one of many regional climate conditions that may change in the future, and it becomes a CID because\nthere are many elements of society and ecosystems that rely on an expected seasonality of snow cover. Climate\nscientists and climate service providers examining human-driven climate change may identify different regions\nwhere the length of the season with snow cover could increase, decrease, or stay relatively unaffected. In each\nregion, change in seasonal snow cover may affect different systems in beneficial or detrimental ways (in the\nlatter case, changing seasonal snow cover would be a &#8216;hazard&#8217;), although systems such as coastal aquaculture\nremain relatively unaffected. The changing profile of benefits and hazards connected to these changes in the\nseasonal snow cover CID affects the profile of impacts, risks and benefits that stakeholders in the region will\ngrapple with in response to climate change.</td>
