The editorial echoes the warnings that health is already being harmed by global temperature increases.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Such health consequences will most severely impact infants and young children, especially those living in low-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is because, compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are particularly susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes, and diseases.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> According to a recently published UNICEF report, one billion children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The report indicates that the aggregate disease burden of children living in LMICs from climate-related outcomes, such as malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria, is likely to increase. Henrietta Fore, UNICEF&#8217;s executive director, warns that &#8220;virtually no child&#8217;s life will be unaffected,&#8221; making climate change a children&#8217;s rights crisis. Moreover, she notes that children from countries that are least responsible will suffer most.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
