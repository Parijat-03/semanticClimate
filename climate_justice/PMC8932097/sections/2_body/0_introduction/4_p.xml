This is important for several reasons. First, our research provides additional evidence as to the broad health benefits of climate change mitigation, and as such increased support for global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Climate change is increasingly being described as a health emergency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and our paper demonstrates clearly that food security, including access to healthy and nutritious food, is harmed by increasing temperatures and increasing drought, and thus conversely, climate change mitigation will have a positive impact on food security. Second, a lack of empirical data has been highlighted as a key constraint, particularly for vulnerable countries, when it comes to designing policies and practices to address loss and damage, a focal area highlighted at the Glasgow COP26<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this paper we are able to quantify for the first time the extent to which regions have differentially experienced loss and damage with respect to food security. Third, our research is important for discussions of climate justice. We find that African countries, which are least responsible for emissions, are experiencing the most negative impacts of climate change on food security. Fourth, the evidence generated in this paper can be used by policy makers to identify climate-food insecurity hotspots, to enable the design of more effective tailored policies that take into local contexts.</p>
