<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.</p>
<p>In the context of <em>climate change</em>, risks can arise from potential <em>impacts</em> of climate change as well as human responses to climate change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, <em>livelihoods</em>, health and <em>well-being</em>, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including <em>ecosystem services</em>), <em>ecosystems</em> and species.<br><br>In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related <em>hazards</em> with the <em>exposure</em> and <em>vulnerability</em> of the affected human or ecological system to the hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and <em>likelihood</em> of occurrence, and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human decision-making (see also <em>risk management</em>, <em>adaptation</em> and <em>mitigation</em>).<br> <br> In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal objectives, such as the <em>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) </em>(see also<em> risk trade-off</em>). Risks can arise, for example, from uncertainty in implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of <em>climate policy</em>, climate-related investments, technology development or adoption, and system transitions.</p>
