The synergies and trade-offs between the food system mitigation and adaptation options described in Sections&#160;5.3 and&#160;5.5 are of increasing importance in both scientific and policy communities because of the necessity to ensure food security,&#160;i.e.,&#160;providing nutritious food for growing populations while responding to climate change (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015). A&#160;special challenge involves interactions between land-based non-food system mitigation, such as negative emissions technologies, and food security.

Among the available NETs, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are receiving increasing attention. Land-based CDRs include afforestation and reforestation (AR), sustainable forest management, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and biochar (BC) production (Minx et al. 2018). Most of the literature on global land-based mitigation potential relies on CDRs, particularly on BECCS, as a&#160;major mitigation action (Kraxner et al. 2014; Larkin et al. 2018 and Rogelj et al. 2018, 2015, 2011).

Since not all plant biomass is harvested (e.g.,&#160;roots and harvesting losses), it can produce co-benefits related to soil carbon sequestration, crop productivity, crop quality, as well improvements in air quality, but the overall benefits strongly depend on the previous land-use and soil management practices (Smith et al. 2016; Wood et al. 2018). In addition, CDR effectiveness varies widely depending on type of biomass, crop productivity, and emissions offset in the energy system.
