Joytee explained that when she used the PTOS, referred to as the Bednala process in Bengali, she realised that despite the labour saving advantages some technical issues remained. Some of the seeds were vulnerable to disturbance by chickens foraging for food. She also noticed that seeds germinated at different rates due to differences in soil water content and that they grew at various speeds due to differences in soil fertility. She therefore fenced her land, selectively improved soil fertility and developed an effective irrigation system. When she shared her experience with the RDRS, &#8220;they told me that we taught you our method now you can do whatever you want&#8221;. Joytee then took her experience to the Kalipara Union Federation meeting where interest was higher. &#8220;Women came to me to find out more. I told them to apply this method to get a better result. They listened to me very attentively.&#8221; More broadly, Bengali and Santal women appreciate the Bednala process (PTOS) because it saves them a lot of time (amounting to several days). They can attend to their other work and this is their &#8220;favourite thing&#8221; about the new practice.</p>
