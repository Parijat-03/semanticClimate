<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="ab0005"><p>Food insecurity remains a critical issue worldwide. The current COVID-19 crisis has exposed how vulnerable the global food systems are and that urgent measures need to be taken, especially in the Global South. Despite increased recognition that women are among the most food insecure yet major contributors to local and global food security over the recent years, there has not been a systemic change needed in the current food security paradigm. This paper argues that, in developing countries, a stronger gender lens ought to be at the center to the food systems' debate as women are critical to agriculture and food systems' sustainability and resilience. Women are central to food systems, both as primary food producers and as primary caretakers of the household. Three key recommendations are put forward in this article for establishing inclusive, sustainable and resilient food systems: One, ensuring a stronger gender lens in food systems and food security paradigms; by working with accurate sex-disaggregated data and beyond on individuals' level. Two, promoting and supporting alternative strategies to agriculture as a means of livelihood for women. Three, ensuring that women are central in food security solutions by not only listening to their concerns and needs, but also building on their resilience, knowledge, and practices.</p></abstract>
