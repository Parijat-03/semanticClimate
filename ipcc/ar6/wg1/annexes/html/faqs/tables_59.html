The figure illustrates schematically the broad range of knowledge that must be blended with the diversity of users to distil information that will\nhave relevance and credibility. This blending or distillation should engage the values and knowledge of both the stakeholders and the scientists. The bottom\nrow contains examples of stakeholders&#8217; interests and is not all-inclusive. As part of the distillation, the outcomes can advance the United Nations&#8217; Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, covered in part by these examples.</td>
