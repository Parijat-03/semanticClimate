<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our video intervention was designed to boost the 11 psychological factors. The intervention consisted of 12 videos, each of which contained a mixture of two or more of the 11 psychological factors of interest. Each video was built on a theme (1. intro, 2. environmental threat, 3. human threat, 4. energy sources, 5. politics, 6. climate justice, 7. the climate movement, 8. victims and perpetrators, 9. neoliberalism and consumerism, 10. obstacles to engage, 11. how change happens, 12. imagine a climate-friendly world) and the 12 themes were selected based on the thematic curriculum of a college course on climate change taught by Dr Aron. The choice to build thematic videos, rather than building each video around one of the 11 factors, was done for two reasons: first, we were hoping to repeat the mobilizing effect of Dr Aron's class by adopting its thematic design which has repeatedly motivated students to climate action; and second, to prevent the participants from recognizing too easily in the videos the factors we were trying to boost.</p>
