Agriculture is central to its economy. Rice, maize, wheat, dal, jute, mangoes, lychees and vegetables are important crops. Livestock, including goats, cattle, poultry and fish are widely raised. Over the past 10 years, maize and especially wheat have become popular commercial crops. New technologies, including improved seeds and breeds, machinery and new methods of cultivation have been introduced in almost all crops and livestock. The development of paved roads enables male farmers to sell produce in local towns, as does the widespread use of cell phones. Electrification and the internet have also helped to improve livelihoods. As a consequence, Kalipara has been experiencing important economic dynamism for around a decade. Many men now work in off-farm occupations, and some farmers are becoming wealthy as a consequence of all these changes. Since there have been so many changes, it is not possible to directly attribute improvements in livelihoods specifically to the adoption of wheat&#8211;maize innovations. At the same time, successful adoption of these technologies demonstrably plays a role in economic betterment as shown in the Findings.</p>
