<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Exceedance of a specified global warming level, followed by a decline to or below that level during a specified period of time (e.g., before 2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot is also characterised. The overshoot duration can vary from one pathway to the next, but in most overshoot pathways in the literature and as referred to as overshoot pathways in the AR6, the overshoot occurs over a period of at least one decade and up to several decades.</p></dd>
