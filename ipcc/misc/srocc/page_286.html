Particulate matter (PM;&#160;that is, the suspended particles in the air of up to 10 micrometres (PM10) or less in size),&#160;have damaging effects on human health (D&#237;az et al. 2017; Goudarzi et al. 2017; Goudie 2014; Samoli et al. 2011).

The primary health effects of dust storms include damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (Goudie 2013). Dust particles with a&#160;diameter smaller than&#160;2.5&#956;m were associated with global cardiopulmonary mortality of about 402,000 people in 2005, with&#160;3.47&#160;million years of life lost in that single year (Giannadaki et al. 2014). Although globally only&#160;1.8% of cardiopulmonary deaths were caused by dust storms, in the countries of the Sahara region, Middle East, South and East Asia, dust storms were suggested to be the cause of 15&#8211;50% of all cardiopulmonary deaths (Giannadaki et al. 2014).

Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur in the Sahelian region during the dry seasons with dusty conditions (Agier et al. 2012; Molesworth et al. 2003). Despite a&#160;strong concentration of dust storms in the Sahel, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, there is relatively little research on human health impacts of dust storms in these regions. More research on health impacts and related costs of dust storms, as well as on public health response measures, can help in mitigating these health impacts.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="201.85" top="147.42"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.04; y0: 147.42; y1: 157.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="147.42" x1="201.85">1.4.2.4 Impacts on gender equality</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="123.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.64; y0: 123.52; y1: 133.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="123.52" x1="307.29">Environmental issues such as deserti&#64257;cation and impacts of climate change have been increasingly investigated through a&#160;gender lens (Bose (n.d.); Broeckhoven and Cliquet 2015; Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Kiptot et al. 2014; Villamor and van Noordwijk 2016).

Socially structured gender-speci&#64257;c roles and responsibilities, daily activities, access and control over resources, decision-making and opportunities lead men and women to interact differently with natural resources and landscapes. For example, water scarcity affected women more than men in rural Ghana as they had to spend more time in fetching water, which has implications on time allocations for other activities (Ahmed et al. 2016). Despite the evidence pointing to differentiated impact of environmental degradation on women and men, gender issues have been marginally addressed in many land restoration and rehabilitation efforts, which often remain gender-blind.

Women are usually excluded from local decision-making on actions regarding deserti&#64257;cation and climate change. Socially constructed gender-speci&#64257;c roles and responsibilities are not static because they are shaped by other factors such as wealth, age, ethnicity and formal education (Kaijser&#160;and Kronsell 2014; Villamor et al. 2014). Hence, women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s environmental knowledge and priorities for restoration often differ (Sijapati Basnett et al. 2017). In some areas where sustainable land options (e.g.,&#160;agroforestry) are being promoted, women were not able to participate due to culturally embedded asymmetries in power relations between men and women (Catacutan and Villamor 2016). Nonetheless women, particularly in the rural areas, remain heavily involved in securing food for their households. Food security for them is associated with land productivity and women&#8217;s contribution to address deserti&#64257;cation is crucial.</span></div><div left="317.76" right="488.32" top="375.42"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.56; y0: 375.42; y1: 385.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="375.42" x1="488.32">1.4.2.5  Impacts on water scarcity and use</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="351.52"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.69; y0: 351.52; y1: 361.02; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="351.52" x1="565.81">Reduced water retention capacity of degraded soils ampli&#64257;es &#64258;oods (de la Paix et al. 2011), reinforces degradation processes through soil erosion, and reduces annual intake of water to aquifers, exacerbating existing water scarcities (Le Roux et al. 2017; Cano et al. 2018). Reduced vegetation cover and more intense dust storms were found to intensify droughts (Cook et al. 2009). Moreover, secondary salinisation in the irrigated drylands often requires leaching with considerable amounts of water (Greene et al. 2016; Wichelns and Qadir 2015). Thus, different types of soil degradation increase water scarcity both through lower water quantity and quality (Liu et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2016c). All these processes reduce water availability for other needs. In this context, climate change will further intensify water scarcity in some dryland areas and increase the frequency of droughts (</span><span style="x0: 534.42; x1: 541.28; y0: 207.54; y1: 217.04; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="534.42" y0="207.54" x1="565.8">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 356.48; x1: 359.12; y0: 195.54; y1: 205.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="356.48" y0="195.54" x1="565.78">) (IPCC 2013; Zheng et al. 2018) (Section&#160;2.2). Higher water scarcity may imply growing use of wastewater ef&#64258;uents for irrigation (Pedrero et al. 2010). The use of untreated wastewater exacerbates soil degradation processes (Tal 2016; Singh et al. 2004; Qishlaqi et al. 2008; Hanjra et al. 2012), in addition to negative human health impacts (Faour-Klingbeil and Todd 2018; Hanjra et al. 2012). Climate change will thus amplify the need for integrated land and water management for sustainable development.</span></div></body></html>
