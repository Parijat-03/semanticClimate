Climate impacts on deserti&#64257;cation are not only de&#64257;ned by projected trends in mean temperature and precipitation values but are also strongly dependent on changes in climate variability and extremes (Reyer et al. 2013). The responses of ecosystems depend on diverse vegetation types. Drier ecosystems are more sensitive to changes in precipitation and temperature (Li et al. 2018; Seddon et al. 2016; You et al. 2018), increasing vulnerability to deserti&#64257;cation. It has also been reported that areas with high variability in precipitation tend to have lower livestock densities and that those societies that have a&#160;strong dependence on livestock that graze natural forage are especially affected (Sloat et al. 2018). Social vulnerability in drylands increases as a&#160;consequence of climate change that threatens the viability of pastoral food systems (Dougill et al. 2010; L&#243;pez-i-Gelats et al. 2016). Social drivers can also play an important role with regards to future vulnerability (M&#225;&#241;ez Costa et al. 2011). In the arid region of north-western China, Liu et al. (2016b) estimated that under RCP4.5 areas of increased vulnerability to climate change and deserti&#64257;cation will surpass those with decreased vulnerability. </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.31" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.87; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="447.56" x1="307.31">Using an ensemble of global climate, integrated assessment and impact models, Byers et al.

Of particular relevance to deserti&#64257;cation are the water (e.g.,&#160;water stress, drought intensity) and the land (e.g.,&#160;habitat degradation) indicators. Under shared socio-economic pathway SSP2&#160;(&#8216;Middle of the Road&#8217;) at&#160;1.5&#176;C, 2&#176;C and 3&#176;C of global warming, the numbers of dryland populations exposed (vulnerable) to various impacts related to water, energy and land sectors (e.g.,&#160;water stress, drought intensity, habitat degradation) are projected to reach 951 (178) million,&#160;1152 (220) million and&#160;1285 (277) million, respectively. While at global warming of 2&#176;C, under SSP1&#160;(&#8216;Sustainability&#8217;), the exposed (vulnerable) dryland population is 974 (35) million, and under SSP3&#160;(&#8216;Fragmented World&#8217;) it is&#160;1267 (522) million. Steady increases in the exposed and vulnerable populations are seen for increasing global mean temperatures. However much larger differences are seen in the vulnerable population under different SSPs. Around half the vulnerable population is in South Asia, followed by Central Asia, West Africa and East Asia.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="221.75" top="183.42"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.44; y0: 183.42; y1: 193.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.24" y0="183.42" x1="221.75">1.5.2 Future projections of impacts</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.27" top="159.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.29; y0: 159.52; y1: 169.02; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="159.52" x1="307.27">Future climate change is expected to increase the potential for increased soil erosion by water in dryland areas (</span><span style="x0: 230.63; x1: 237.49; y0: 147.53; y1: 157.03; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="230.63" y0="147.53" x1="300.46">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 300.46; x1: 303.1; y0: 147.53; y1: 157.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="300.46" y0="147.53" x1="307.31">).

In northern Iran, under the SRES A2 emission scenario the mean erosion potential is projected to grow by 45%, comparing the period 1991&#8211;2010 with 2031&#8211;2050 (Zare et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.85" top="735.55"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 323.22; y0: 735.55; y1: 745.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.55" x1="565.85">A&#160;strong decrease in precipitation for almost all parts of Turkey was projected for the period 2021&#8211;2050 compared to 1971&#8211;2000 using Regional Climate Model, RegCM4.4 of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (T&#252;rke&#351; et al. 2019). The projected changes in precipitation distribution can lead to more extreme precipitation events and prolonged droughts, increasing Turkey&#8217;s vulnerability to soil erosion. In Portugal, a&#160;study comparing wet and dry catchments under A1B and B1 emission scenarios showed an increase in erosion in dry catchments (Serpa et al. 2015). In Morocco an increase in sediment load is projected as a&#160;consequence of reduced precipitation (Simonneaux et al. 2015). WGII AR5 concluded the impact of increases in heavy rainfall and temperature on soil erosion will be modulated by soil management practices, rainfall seasonality and land cover (Jim&#233;nez Cisneros et al. 2014). Ravi et al. (2010) predicted an increase in hydrologic and aeolian soil erosion processes as a&#160;consequence of droughts in drylands.
