<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0065">Energy transitions cannot be detached from society <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, nor idealised by theoretical modelling alone, in questioning the societal desirability of sustainable transitions. How can we gain an understanding of individual, group and societal behaviours and preferences in respect to climate change and action, if not by engaging with society itself <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>? Initiative-based learning has for years been proposed as an approach to understanding expectations and strategies of actors on the ground <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, and therefore to exploring and evaluating transitions <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. But, despite its strength in dealing with the complexity of transitions at the local level, its short-term, micro-scale insights <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>, however valuable, are not tailored to inform or draw from the more generalised modelling exercises dominating the climate science literature. As a result, the role of community, e.g. grassroots initiatives, in social transformation towards decarbonisation is often underestimated. The combined effort of these initiatives, when scaled up, pose as alternative viable and desirable pathways, rather than standalone cases operating in silos.</p>
