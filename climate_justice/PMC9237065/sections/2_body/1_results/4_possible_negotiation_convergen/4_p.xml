The plot indicates the range of the 2030 reduction targets across all negotiation convergence settings, i.e., the range and extremes of country reduction targets that results across all negotiation convergence points for both the &#8220;closest to upper bound of equity-compatible emissions&#8221; and &#8220;minimal change from the 2018 ESR&#8221; on a per capita basis. The distributions of these results can be compared to the solid black line, indicating EU Member State 2030 targets as proposed by the EC in 2021. When comparing to this effort-sharing proposal, we find that a broader acknowledgment of equity dimensions enhances the variability of emission reduction targets. Countries that have the lowest emission reduction obligations under the EU proposal tend to have even less restrictive ones when further equity dimensions are considered as well (e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Croatia). Conversely, countries with the highest reduction obligation under the EU proposal tend to have even more stringent ones once one or both of the other equity dimensions are considered as well (e.g. Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland). The two notable exceptions to the latter group are Germany and Sweden, who rank high in EU proposal obligations, but would not have to increase their reduction target under alternative considerations, most importantly due to their recent strong emission reduction, implying for example no additional reduction obligation from historic emissions consideration.</p>
