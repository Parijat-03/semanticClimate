This land has continuously diminished in the past decade largely due to urbanization. The major crops grown in the Delhi area are wheat, barley, jowar, bajra, maize, paddy, gram, potato, sugarcane. The growth and productivity of these crops is vulnerable to the changes in temperature and rainfall intensity as projected for Delhi (Haris, et al., 2013). The table (Delhi Statistical handbook, 2012) below illustrates the land share of the various crops grown in Delhi.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="629.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="629.43" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 629.43; y1: 641.43; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="133.22" y0="629.43" x1="526.19" style="x0: 133.22; x1: 141.88; y0: 629.43; y1: 641.43; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">A large majority of the agricultural land in Delhi is in the Yamuna flood plains that will be particularly vulnerable to flash floods as discussed, which will make this part of Delhi more vulnerable to impacts of climate change on agriculture. The change in weather patterns may also serve to reduce productivity of the land in Delhi. The productivity of land already shows a declining trend. This trend may be exacerbated due to increases in temperature and more intense rainfall. The reduction in productivity in Delhi&#8217;s agriculture would also mean an increase in expenditure in transportation of food products to the capital. This is in turn a source of greenhouse gas emissions.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="175.58" top="490.44"><span x0="72.02" y0="490.44" x1="175.58" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 490.44; y1: 502.44; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity: </span><span x0="176.66" y0="490.44" x1="526.05" style="x0: 176.66; x1: 180.66; y0: 490.44; y1: 502.44; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">IARI located in Delhi is working on crop varieties that are resistant to change in climatic patterns (IARI, 2012). This is in addition to the spread of kitchen/terrace gardens in the city of Delhi, which contributes to sustainable organic food sources for the citizens of Delhi (GNCTD, 2012).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="250.37" top="414.7"><span x0="72.02" y0="414.7" x1="250.37" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.69; y0: 414.7; y1: 426.7; width: 4.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Impacts on Forests &amp; Biodiversity </span></div><div left="72.02" right="127.7" top="387.1"><span x0="72.02" y0="387.1" x1="127.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 387.1; y1: 399.1; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure: </span><span x0="128.18" y0="387.1" x1="526.24" style="x0: 128.18; x1: 135.51; y0: 387.1; y1: 399.1; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The changing land-use patterns due to rapid urbanisation in Delhi will impact the biodiversity severely in Delhi. This may lead to the degradation of ridge and loss of native biodiversity, both of which may be further influenced by changing climate patterns. All these may lead to ecological instability and environmental deterioration which in turn results in loss of resilience (Khera et al., 2009).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="295.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="295.78" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 295.78; y1: 307.78; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="132.86" y0="295.78" x1="526.0" style="x0: 132.86; x1: 141.52; y0: 295.78; y1: 307.78; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">A study performed by National Climate Centre in 2011 has shown a decrease in the moisture index in Delhi. This means that Delhi&#8217;s land is becoming increasingly more arid. This trend may serve to change plant growth patterns and therefore affect biodiversity. Climate change has been found to increase the incidences of ecological disturbances like wild fires and insect outbreaks (Dhote, 2012).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="174.86" top="204.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="204.43" x1="174.86" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 204.43; y1: 216.43; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity: </span><span x0="175.22" y0="204.43" x1="526.03" style="x0: 175.22; x1: 182.55; y0: 204.43; y1: 216.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The forest area in Delhi has continuously increased in the past ten years and more green spaces are planned as per Delhi&#8217;s City Development Plan.  This would add to the recently developed biodiversity parks in the city of Delhi (CDP, 2010). The green spaces are also being designed to encourage floral and faunal biodiversity, which would aid in improving the ecological health of the city-state of Delhi (Khera, et al., 2009). The table (Delhi Statistical Handbook, 2012) below provides a description of the forest areas present in the various parts of Delhi. The table illustrates that a large majority of forested land in Delhi is concentrated in South Delhi, with low concentrations in North and East Delhi. These parts of </span></div></body></html>
