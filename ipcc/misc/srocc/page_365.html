While many of the certi&#64257;ed forests are found in temperate and boreal countries (Rametsteiner and Simula 2003; MacDicken et al. 2015), examples from the tropics also show that SFM can improve outcomes. For example, selective logging emits&#160;6% of the tropical GHG annually and improved logging practices can reduce emissions by 44% while maintaining timber production (Ellis et al. 2019). In the Congo Basin, implementing reduced impact logging (RIL-C) practices can cut emissions in half without reducing the timber yield (Umunay et al. 2019). SFM adoption depends on the socio-economic and political context, and its improvement depends mainly on better reporting and veri&#64257;cation (Siry et al. 2005).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="579.54" x1="313.26">The successful implementation of SFM requires well-established and functional governance, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms to eliminate deforestation, illegal logging, arson, and other activities that are inconsistent with SFM principles (Nasi et al. 2011). Moreover, following human and natural disturbances, forest regrowth must be ensured through reforestation, site rehabilitation activities or natural regeneration. Failure of forests to regrow following disturbances will lead to unsustainable outcomes and long-term reductions in forest area, forest cover, carbon density, forest productivity and land-based carbon sinks (Nasi et al. 2011). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.56" x1="313.22">Achieving all of the criteria of the de&#64257;nitions of SLM and SFM is an aspirational goal that will be made more challenging where climate change impacts, such as biome shifts and increased disturbances, are predicted to adversely affect future biodiversity and contribute to forest degradation (Warren et al. 2018). Land management to enhance land sinks will involve trade-offs that need to be assessed within their spatial, temporal and societal context. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="303.24" top="339.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 339.42; y1: 349.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="339.42" x1="303.24">1.1.6 The human dimension of land degradation and forest degradation </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="303.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 303.52; y1: 313.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="303.52" x1="313.26">Studies of land and forest degradation are often biased towards biophysical aspects, both in terms of its processes, such as erosion or nutrient depletion, and its observed physical manifestations, such as gullying or low primary productivity. Land users&#8217; own perceptions and knowledge about land conditions and degradation have often been neglected or ignored by both policymakers and scientists (Reed et al. 2007; Forsyth 1996; Andersson et al. 2011). A&#160;growing body of work is nevertheless beginning to focus on land degradation through the lens of local land users (Kessler and Stroosnijder 2006; Fairhead and Scoones 2005; Zimmerer 1993; Stocking et al. 2001) and the importance of local and indigenous knowledge within land management is starting to be appreciated (Montanarella et al. 2018). Climate change impacts directly and indirectly on the social reality, the land users, and the ecosystem, and vice versa. Land degradation can also have an impact on climate change (Section&#160;4.6). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="111.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 111.55; y1: 121.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="111.55" x1="313.21">The use and management of land is highly gendered and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future (Kristjanson et al. 2017). Women often have less formal access to land than men and less in&#64258;uence over decisions about land, even if they carry out many of the land management tasks (Jerneck 2018a; Elmhirst 2011; Toulmin </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="735.56"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.28; y0: 735.56; y1: 745.06; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.56" x1="571.78">2009; Peters 2004; Agarwal 1997; Jerneck 2018b). Many oft-cited general statements about women&#8217;s subordination in agriculture are dif&#64257;cult to substantiate, yet it is clear that gender inequality persists (Doss et al. 2015). Even if women&#8217;s access to land is changing formally (Kumar and Quisumbing 2015), the practical outcome is often limited due to several other factors related to both formal and informal institutional arrangements and values (Lavers 2017; Kristjanson et al. 2017; Djurfeldt et al. 2018). Women are also affected differently than men when it comes to climate change, having lower adaptive capacities due to factors such as prevailing land tenure frameworks, less access to other capital assets and dominant cultural practices (Vincent et al. 2014; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Gabrielsson et al. 2013). This affects the options available to women to respond to both land degradation and climate change. Indeed, access to land and other assets (e.g.,&#160;education and training) is key in shaping land-use and land management strategies (Liu et al. 2018b; Lambin et al. 2001). Young people are also often disadvantaged in terms of access to resources and decision-making power, even though they carry out much of the day-to-day work (Wilson et al. 2017; Kosec et al. 2018; Naamwintome and Bagson 2013).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="483.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.59; y0: 483.59; y1: 493.09; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="483.59" x1="571.8">Land rights differ between places and are dependent on the political-economic and legal context (Montanarella et al. 2018). This means that there is no universally applicable best arrangement. Agriculture in highly erosion-prone regions requires site-speci&#64257;c and long-lasting soil and water conservation measures, such as terraces (Section&#160;4.8.1), which may bene&#64257;t from secure private land rights (Tarfasa et al. 2018; Soule et al. 2000). Pastoral modes of production and community-based forest management systems are often dominated by, and bene&#64257;t from, communal land tenure arrangements, which may con&#64258;ict with agricultural/forestry modernisation policies implying private property rights (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Benjaminsen and Lund 2003; Itkonen 2016; Owour et al. 2011; Gebara 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="315.61"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 315.61; y1: 325.11; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="315.61" x1="571.77">Cultural ecosystem services, de&#64257;ned as the non-material bene&#64257;ts people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, re&#64258;ection, recreation and aesthetic experiences (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) are closely linked to land and ecosystems, although often under-represented in the literature on ecosystem services (Tengberg et al. 2012; Hern&#225;ndez-Morcillo et al. 2013). Climate change interacting with land conditions can impact on cultural aspects, such as sense of place and sense of belonging (Olsson et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="528.04" top="183.01"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.96; y0: 183.01; y1: 195.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="183.01" x1="528.04">1.2 Land degradation in the context of&#160;climate change </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="147.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.58; y0: 147.52; y1: 157.02; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="147.52" x1="571.8">Land degradation results from a&#160;complex chain of causes making the clear distinction between direct and indirect drivers dif&#64257;cult. In the context of climate change, an additional complex aspect is brought by the reciprocal effects that both processes have on each other (i.e.&#160;climate change in&#64258;uencing land degradation and vice versa).
