Research in Bellona, in the Solomon Islands in the South Paci&#64257;c (Reenberg et al. 2008) examined event-driven impacts on livelihoods, taking into account weather events as one of many drivers of land degradation and links to broader land use and land cover changes that have taken place. Geographical locations experiencing land degradation are often the same locations that are directly affected by poverty, and also by extreme events linked to climate change and variability. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.95" top="507.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 72.31; y0: 507.55; y1: 517.05; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="507.55" x1="312.95">Much of the assessment presented above has considered place-based analyses examining the relationships between poverty, land degradation and climate change in the locations in which these outcomes have occurred. Altieri and Nicholls (2017) note that, due to the globalised nature of markets and consumption systems, the impacts of changes in crop yields linked to climate-related land degradation (manifest as lower yields) will be far reaching, beyond the sites and livelihoods experiencing degradation. Despite these teleconnections, farmers living in poverty in developing countries will be especially vulnerable due to their exposure, dependence on the environment for income and limited options to engage in other ways to make a&#160;living (Rosenzweig and Hillel 1998). In identifying ways in which these interlinkages can be addressed, Scherr (2000) observes that key actions that can jointly address poverty and environmental improvement often seek to increase access to natural resources, enhance the productivity of the natural resource assets of the poor, and engage stakeholders in addressing public natural resource management issues. In this regard, it is increasingly recognised that those suffering from, and being vulnerable to, land degradation and </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.52" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.01; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.58" x1="571.52">poverty need to have a&#160;voice and play a&#160;role in the development of solutions, especially where the natural resources and livelihood activities they depend on are further threatened by climate change. </span></div><div left="323.43" right="550.79" top="675.42"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.63; y0: 675.42; y1: 685.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.43" y0="675.42" x1="550.79">1.7.2 Impacts of climate-related land degradation on&#160;food security</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.51" top="639.52"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.89; y0: 639.52; y1: 649.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="639.52" x1="571.51">How and where we grow food, compared to where and when we need to consume it, is at the crux of issues surrounding land degradation, climate change and food security, especially because more than 75% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) faces rain-fed crop production constraints (Fischer et al. 2009), see also Chapter&#160;5. Taken separately, knowledge on land degradation processes and human-induced climate change has attained a&#160;great level of maturity. However, their combined effects on food security, notably food supply, remain underappreciated (Webb et al. 2017b), and quantitative information is lacking. Just a&#160;few studies have shown how the interactive effects of the aforementioned challenging, interrelated phenomena can impact on crop productivity and hence food security and quality (Karami et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2001; H&#246;gy and Fangmeier 2008) (</span><span style="x0: 351.04; x1: 353.15; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="351.04" y0="483.54" x1="399.98">low evidence</span><span style="x0: 399.97; x1: 402.61; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="399.97" y0="483.54" x1="571.49">). Along with socio-economic drivers, climate change accelerates land degradation due to its in&#64258;uence on land-use systems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; UNCCD 2017), potentially leading to a&#160;decline in agri-food system productivity, particularly on the supply side. Increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns are expected to have impacts on soil quality, including nutrient availability and assimilation (St.Clair and Lynch 2010). Those climate-related changes are expected to have net negative impacts on agricultural productivity, particularly in tropical regions, though the magnitude of impacts depends on the models used. Anticipated supply-side issues linked to land and climate relate to biocapacity factors (including&#160;e.g.,&#160;whether there is enough water to support agriculture); production factors (e.g., chemical pollution of soil and water resources or lack of soil nutrients) and distribution issues (e.g., decreased availability of and/or accessibility to the necessary diversity of quality food where and when it is needed) (Stringer et al. 2011).
