In short, the model includes: (1) the determinants of climate change; (2) its environmental and social consequences; (3) its direct and indirect impacts on health; and (4) the role of mitigation and adaptation policies. The model places special emphasis on the associated social and health inequalities through: (1) the recognition of the role of systems of privilege and oppression; (2) the distinction between structural and intermediate determinants of climate change and their identification as also being at the root of health inequalities; (3) the role of individual and collective vulnerability in mediating the health effects of climate change on health; and (4) the need to always act from a climate justice perspective to reverse health inequities.</p>
