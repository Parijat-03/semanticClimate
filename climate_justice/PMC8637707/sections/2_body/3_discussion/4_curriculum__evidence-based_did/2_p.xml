were part of 5 of the sessions. There are many benefits to simulation including
&#8220;practice of complex clinical situations; rehearsal of serious and&#8260;or rare
events; rehearsal of planned, novel or infrequent interventions; and induction
into new clinical environments.&#8221;<sup>

</sup> Use of simulation with standardized patients or public health scenarios
reduces risks to patients, communities, and learners. Educationally, simulation
supports principles of active learning, safe application of knowledge and
skills, and opportunity for iterative practice with feedback, incorporating
evidence-based knowledge within each case or scenario.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-23821205211061019" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-23821205211061019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
