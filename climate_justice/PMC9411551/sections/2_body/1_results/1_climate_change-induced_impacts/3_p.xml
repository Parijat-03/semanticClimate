For all seven climate change-attribution scenarios we consider, almost every flooded building (&gt;99%) experienced at least some flooding attributed to climate change. These depths varied: the median increased flood depths attributed to climate change was 22&#8201;cm in the (20%) lower climate change-attribution scenario, and 27&#8201;cm in the (38%) higher scenario.</p>
