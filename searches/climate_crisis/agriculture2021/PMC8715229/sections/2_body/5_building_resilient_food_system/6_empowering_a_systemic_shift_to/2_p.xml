<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0400">With the looming risk of future pandemics, shocks associated with climate change, and global environmental and socioeconomic changes compounding local pressures, the way food systems are framed needs to change. The prevailing emphasis on efficiency, which is focused on maximizing production relative to cost, is insufficient for shaping the food system architecture in a sustainable manner so that it can meet intertwined social, economic, and environmental challenges. Efficiency must be counter-balanced by an emphasis on sustainability principles in general and a focus on equity and resilience in particular. This does not mean that economic growth and efficiency are irrelevant, but rather that greater consideration needs to be given to when this focus is warranted and who benefits from it. Not only the quantity, but also the quality of growth needs to be considered. The global food system needs to deliver universal food and nutritional security. Hence, the architecture of food systems should be guided by how well it serves this primary purpose and how it empowers the most vulnerable and marginal groups.</p>
