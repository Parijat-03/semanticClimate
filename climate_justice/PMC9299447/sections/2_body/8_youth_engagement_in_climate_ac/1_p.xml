</xref> A smattering of studies provide some insight. Ojala's research in Sweden about children and young people's coping with climate change found that &#8216;the more meaning&#8208;focused coping the children used the less they experienced negative affect, and the more they experienced life satisfaction, general positive affect, purpose, and optimism&#8217;.<xref rid="jpc15649-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> In other words, taking climate action helps children and young people feel good, proud, connected to community and hopeful (see also Box 2). Furthermore, de&#8208;emphasising the seriousness of climate change is not helpful for environmental efficacy,<xref rid="jpc15649-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Garcia and Sheehan also report that some children and young people develop coping skills and enhanced resilience when exposed to extreme weather events.<xref rid="jpc15649-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
