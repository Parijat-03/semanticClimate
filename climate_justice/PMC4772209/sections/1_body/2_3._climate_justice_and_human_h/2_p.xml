Comparing two extreme life expectancies in the U.S. in regards to rurality, race, and gender, poor African American men in non-metropolitan areas averaged a 67.7 year life expectancy, which is more than 20 years less than equally poor Asian/Pacific Islander women in metropolitan areas (89.6 years) [<xref rid="B79-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. As suggested by this comparison of life expectancy as an indicator of health, rural and vulnerable populations in the Southeastern U.S. will have unique challenges related to indirect and direct effects of climate change on human health. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00189-f002">Figure 2</xref> identifies human health effects related to climate change in rural areas that may further contribute to urban-rural, racial, and income discrepancies.</p>
