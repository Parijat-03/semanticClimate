<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth, divided into five layers â the <em>troposphere</em> which contains half of the Earthâs atmosphere, the <em>stratosphere</em>, the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere, which is the outer limit of the atmosphere. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93 % volume mixing ratio), helium and radiatively active <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em> such as <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> (0.04% volume mixing ratio), <em>methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</em>, <em>nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</em> and <em>ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</em>. In addition, the atmosphere contains the GHG water vapour (H2O), whose concentrations are highly variable (0â5% volume mixing ratio) as the sources (<em>evapotranspiration</em>) and sinks (precipitation) of water vapour show large spatio-temporal variations, and atmospheric temperature exerts a strong constraint on the amount of water vapour an air parcel can hold. The atmosphere also contains clouds and <em>aerosols</em>.</p></dd>
