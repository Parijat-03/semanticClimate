      <td>Afforestation</td>
      <td>Afforestation is the conversion to forest of land\nthat historically have not contained forests\n(see also &#8216;reforestation&#8217;).</td>
      <td>Afforestation increases terrestrial carbon stocks but\ncan also change the physical properties of land surfaces,\nsuch as surface albedo and evapotranspiration with\nimplications for local and global climate. In the tropics,\nenhanced evapotranspiration cools surface temperatures,\nreinforcing the climate benefits of CO2 sequestration\nin trees. At high latitudes and in areas affected by\nseasonal snow cover, the decrease in surface albedo after\nafforestation becomes dominant and causes an annual\naverage warming that counteracts carbon benefits. Net\nbiophysical effects on regional climate from afforestation\nis seasonal and can reduce the frequency of climate\nextremes, such as heat waves, improving adaptation to\nclimate change and reducing the vulnerability of people\nand ecosystems. Afforestation helps to address land\ndegradation and desertification, as forests tend to maintain\nwater quality by reducing runoff, trapping sediments and\nnutrients, and improving groundwater recharge. However,\nfood security could be hampered since an increase\nin global forest area can increase food prices through\nland competition. Other adverse side effects occur when\nafforestation is based on non-native species, especially with\nthe risks related to the spread of exotic fast-growing tree\nspecies. For example, exotic species can upset the balance\nof evapotranspiration regimes, with negative impacts on\nwater availability, particularly in dry regions.</td>

      <td>Increased soil\norganic carbon\ncontent</td>
      <td>Practices that increase soil organic matter content\ninclude a) land-use change to an ecosystem with higher\nequilibrium soil carbon levels (e.g., from cropland to\nforest), b) management of the vegetation: including high\ninput carbon practices, for example, improved varieties,\nrotations and cover crops, perennial cropping systems,\nbiotechnology to increase inputs and recalcitrance of\nbelow ground carbon, c) nutrient management and\norganic material input to increase carbon returns to the\nsoil, including: optimised fertiliser and organic material\napplication rate, type, timing and precision application,\nd) reduced tillage intensity and residue retention, and\ne) improved water management: including irrigation\nin arid/semi-arid conditions.</td>
      <td>Increasing soil carbon stocks removes CO2 from the\natmosphere and increases the water-holding capacity of\nthe soil, thereby conferring resilience to climate change\nand enhancing adaptation capacity. It is a key strategy for\naddressing both desertification and land degradation. There\nis some evidence that crop yields and yield stability increase\nby increased organic matter content, though some studies\nshow equivocal impacts. Some practices to increase soil\norganic matter stocks vary in their efficacy. For example,\nthe impact of no-till farming and conservation agriculture\non soil carbon stocks is often positive, but can be neutral\nor even negative, depending on the amount of crop\nresidues returned to the soil. If soil organic carbon stocks\nwere increased by increasing fertiliser inputs to increase\nproductivity, emissions of nitrous oxide from fertiliser use\ncould offset any climate benefits arising from carbon sinks.\nSimilarly, if any yield penalty is incurred from practices\naimed at increasing soil organic carbon stocks (e.g., through\nextensification), emissions could be increased through\nindirect land-use change, and there could also be adverse\nside effects on food security.</td>

      <td>Reduced soil\nerosion</td>
      <td>Soil erosion is the removal of soil from the land surface\nby water, wind or tillage, which occurs worldwide but\nit is particularly severe in Asia, Latin America and the\nCaribbean, and the Near East and North Africa. Soil\nerosion management includes conservation practices\n(e.g., the use of minimum tillage or zero tillage, crop\nrotations and cover crops, rational grazing systems),\nengineering-like practices (e.g., construction of terraces\nand contour cropping for controlling water erosion), or\nforest barriers and strip cultivation for controlling wind\nerosion. In eroded soils, the advance of erosion gullies\nand sand dunes can be limited by increasing plant cover,\namong other practices.</td>
      <td>The fate of eroded soil carbon is uncertain, with some\nstudies indicating a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere\nand others suggesting a net sink. Reduced soil erosion has\nbenefits for adaptation as it reduces vulnerability of soils to\nloss under climate extremes, increasing resilience to climate\nchange. Some management practices implemented to\ncontrol erosion, such as increasing ground cover, can reduce\nthe vulnerability of soils to degradation/landslides, and\nprevention of soil erosion is a key measure used to tackle\ndesertification. Because it protects the capacity of land to\nproduce food, it also contributes positively to food security.</td>
