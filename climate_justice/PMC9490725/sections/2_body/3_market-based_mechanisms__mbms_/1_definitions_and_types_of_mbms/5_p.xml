There has been less research on carbon taxes because they are both less popular and less complex than ETSs. While a tax is less complex to administer, the primary problem is the political difficulty of setting a sufficiently high price to influence action. According to Krugman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>: unpaginated), &#8220;claims that a carbon tax high enough to make a meaningful difference would attract significant bipartisan support are a fantasy at best, a fossil-fuel-industry ploy to avoid major action at worst&#8221;. Several countries do in fact have carbon taxes; for example, Sweden has a carbon tax that is levied on all fossil fuels, which started at 23&#8364; per tonne in 1991 and in 2020 was 110&#8364; per tonne. The focus in this paper is the challenge of specific sectors such as maritime transport which is not included in country targets hence needs a solution and also exhibits the ability to be taxed specifically, e.g. on bunker fuel purchases.</p>
