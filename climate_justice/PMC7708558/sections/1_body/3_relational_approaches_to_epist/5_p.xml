<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">The review of the identified social scientific literature shows a growing interest in relational approaches to knowing. These approaches allow social scientists new methods for analyzing human-nonhuman relations. Assemblage theory (DeLanda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>) considers all things living and non-living to be assemblages of human and nonhuman parts. Several methods for studying assemblages have developed in empirical work (e.g. McFarlane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2011</xref>; Baker and McGuirk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>; Feely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>). Actor-network theory (ANT) is among the relational methods most frequently used in the social sciences (Latour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2005</xref>). It does not position humans at the center or apex of agency and responsibility, but rather, considers agency to be distributed among various actants&#8212;none of which are themselves solely responsible for change. It studies how agency is formed by an interlinked chain of beings and processes, rather than any individual. To write about agency outside humanist epistemology, scholars frequently employ multi-species ethnography (e.g. Kirksey and Helmreich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>; Kirksey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>; Multispecies Editing Collective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2017</xref>).</p>
