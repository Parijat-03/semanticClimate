In a &#8220;collective action&#8221; scenario, companies set targets and incur costs to reduce emissions with the expectation that other companies will follow, making it easier for governments to introduce market reforms, for which early SBT adopters will be better prepared. Alternatively, in a &#8220;best in class&#8221; scenario, companies with low emissions, with little difficulty reducing emissions, and already on a decarbonization pathway join CDP and SBTi to formalize and advertise their &#8220;best in class&#8221; status. According to the authors, their findings that target-setting has had little effect on overall corporate emissions and that national determined contributions (NDCs) do not necessarily correspond to increased target-setting support the &#8220;best in class&#8221; explanation rather than the positive policy feedback argument suggested in the &#8220;collective action&#8221; scenario. Regarding current SBT adopters, they conclude &#8220;unless their efforts are supported by public policy to curb emissions and institutional investor pressure, it will be increasingly difficult to persuade the vast majority of companies that are still on the sidelines to join the decarbonization commitment drive.&#8221; We note that recent increases in SBT uptake and policymakers&#8217; references to SBTs (as mentioned in the introduction) could provide support to the &#8220;collective action&#8221; scenario.</p>
