      <td>The Earth&#8217;s energy budget describes the flow of energy within the climate system. Since at least 1970 there\nhas been a persistent imbalance in the energy flows that has led to excess energy being absorbed by the\nclimate system. By measuring and understanding these energy flows and the role that human activities play in\nchanging them, we are better able to understand the causes of climate change and project future climate change</td>

In response to these forcings, the Earth system will either warm or cool, so as to\nrestore balance through changes in the amount of outgoing thermal radiation (the warmer the Earth, the more\nradiation it emits). Changes in Earth&#8217;s temperature in turn lead to additional changes in the climate system\n(known as climate feedbacks) that either amplify or dampen the original effect. For example, Arctic sea ice has\nbeen melting as the Earth warms, reducing the amount of reflected sunlight and adding to the initial warming\n(an amplifying feedback). The most uncertain of those climate feedbacks are clouds, as they respond to warming in\ncomplex ways that affect both the emission of thermal radiation and the reflection of sunlight. However, we are</td>

This sounds small, but because the imbalance is persistent and because Earth&#8217;s surface is\nlarge, this adds up to about 25 times the total amount of primary energy consumed by human society, compared\nover 1971 to 2018. Compared to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), we are now better able to quantify\nand track these energy flows from multiple lines of evidence, including satellite data, direct measurements of\nocean temperatures, and a wide variety of other Earth system observations (see FAQ 1.1).

The atmosphere has\nwarmed substantially since 1970, but because it is comprised of thin gases it has absorbed only 1% of the excess\nenergy (FAQ 7.1, Figure 1). As the ocean has absorbed the vast majority of the excess energy, especially within\nits top two kilometres, the deep ocean is expected to continue to warm and expand for centuries to millennia,\nleading to long-term sea level rise &#8211; even if atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were to decline (see FAQ 5.3).</td>
