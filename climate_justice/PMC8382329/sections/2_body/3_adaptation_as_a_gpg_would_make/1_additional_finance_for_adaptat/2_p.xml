Despite the support of many EU countries on GPG financing, this idea could not proceed much because of opposition from Japan and the USA. Some major EU countries already contribute 0.7% or more of their GNI as ODA, while others remain well below that level. Achieving the 0.7% target could mobilize an additional $200 billion a year. But a recent UK decision to reduce ODA to 0.5% of their GNI is discouraging. Though trillions were mobilized as stimulus packages at short notice to rescue developed economies from the fallout from Covid-19, it is exceedingly unlikely their generosity will match the assumed obligations for adaptation finance. So there are new ideas of mobilizing additional money, through debt for climate swaps, climate bonds, enhanced insurance schemes, airline taxes, etc. (HBS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>).</p>
