Some authors suggest that historical responsibility should be considered from the beginning of the industrial revolution since developed countries&#8217; progress has been tightly linked to their increase in emissions (Cao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Kanitkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). Some others propose that historical responsibility can only be demanded from the moment the international community became conscious of the climate change problem and this would place the date in the early 1990s (Ott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Baer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Gignac and Matthews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). The first IPCC report was published in 1990, and this is when the negotiations that would be taken to the approval of the UNFCCC in Rio-92 were started. After the ratification process, the UNFCCC entered into force in 1994. This date, 1994, marks a point of no return in the multilateral fight against climate change and is the one used in this article when starting to account for historical responsibility.</p>
