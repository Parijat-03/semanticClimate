<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0355">Despite the promotion of circular economy over the last years, industrial production remains too linear and mostly based on non-renewable resources. On a global scale, only a small percentage (12%) of the materials is derived from recycling. In contrast, non-metallic minerals such as sand or gravel account for around half of the extracted resources (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">IRP, 2019</xref>). Scalable innovations and viable technologies could be deployed to produce resource-efficient, circular, and low carbon solutions based on renewable energy and sustainability sourced bio-based materials. A good example is a first-ever car made of nanocellulose, a biomaterial five times lighter and stronger than steel, produced in Japan in 2019. New biomaterials, including bioplastics, hold tremendous promise due to their lower carbon footprint and biodegradability than petrochemical products (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou and Singh, 2020</xref>).</p>
