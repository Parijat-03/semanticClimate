The unique digital platform promotes data sovereignty, as communities are the stewards of their own data. The issues of climate change, food inequity, and solastalgia require innovative solutions. The rapid response enabled via digital platforms combined with the wealth of Traditional Knowledge about the environment and food systems is essential not only to address these issues in partnership with Indigenous communities but also for conversations about climate action and justice, globally.</p>
