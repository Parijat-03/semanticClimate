Presently, kerosene is predominantly used by below poverty line (BPL) families for lighting purpose in their households and to small extent by industries. According to our estimates, by the year 2025 there will be no use of kerosene for lighting purpose, there will be a shift from kerosene to electricity in NCT-Delhi. The historical and estimated final energy consumption by fuel type under different scenarios is given in table 32.  </span></div><div left="75.14" right="505.26" top="93.17"><span x0="75.14" y0="93.17" x1="505.26" style="x0: 75.14; x1: 83.15; y0: 93.17; y1: 105.17; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Table 32: Disaggregation of Final Energy Consumption by Fuel Type in NCT-Delhi in the year 2025 </span></div></body></html>
