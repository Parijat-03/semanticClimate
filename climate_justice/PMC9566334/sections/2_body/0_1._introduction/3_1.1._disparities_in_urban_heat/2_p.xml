However, belonging to a historically marginalized group and residential dissimilarity (a measure of segregation) has a varied but significant relationship using a multilevel modeling approach [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a national-level study using block group-level data across 304 metropolitan areas in the U.S., Jesdale, Morello-Frosh, and Cushing found that non-Hispanic Black populations were 52%, non-Hispanic Asians 32% and Hispanics 21% more likely to live in areas with higher concentrations of &#8220;heat risk related land cover&#8221; [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These conditions increased with increasing degrees of residential segregation. This was determined using the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset to identify &#8216;heat risk related land cover&#8221; and 2000 US Decadal Census data. Hsu et al., utilizing the same SUHI dataset used in the present study and 2017 ACS 5-year data, found that on average persons of color live in census tracts with higher SUHI intensity than non-Hispanic Whites in all but 6 of the 175 largest urbanized areas in the continental US [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
