Goal number 10 specifically commits to the social, economic and political inclusion and empowerment of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion and economic or other status (10.2). It recommends eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and developing empowering legislation, policies and action (10.3). Goal number 5, supported by 24 gender targets across the SDGs, commits nations to &#8220;achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls&#8221; (Koehler <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, SDG 5b). One mechanism of achieving this is through linking access to technology with women&#8217;s empowerment (Koehler <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). More broadly, Target 2.3 recognises strengthening women&#8217;s roles in the agricultural economy as integral to doubling agricultural productivity and the incomes of small-scale food producers by 2030. Policy recommendations associated with this Target including promoting secure and equal access to productive resources, inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment (Koehler <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
