We hypothesize that climate justice is not only the ultimate goal of pro-environmental behavior but also its cause as justice functions as a motivator of behavior. To our knowledge, justice sensitivity perspectives have not yet been associated with pro-environmental intention and behavior. Based on the reported findings, the aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which perceptions of injustice predict pro-environmental intention and, in turn, might even predict pro-environmental behavior. More precisely, we assume that the pro-social justice sensitivities (perpetrator, observer, and beneficiary) are positively associated with pro-environmental intention (H1a). The pro-self justice sensitivity (victim) and the tendency to morally disengage are assumed to be negatively associated with pro-environmental intention (H2a). Furthermore, we assume an influence of moral emotions (guilt, shame, authentic and hubristic pride, and gratitude) on pro-environmental intention (H3b).</p>
