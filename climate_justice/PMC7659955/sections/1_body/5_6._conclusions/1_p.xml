<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The uniqueness of smart village projects around the world means that approaches towards smart village development might also differ. This study showed that smart and CSA are key areas that must be considered in developing a smart village project, and offer several lessons to proponents of smart village ideas, given how these concepts have enjoyed steady conceptualization in the research literature. Another important consideration that must be carefully explored is the tendency of developing smart villages in line with the concepts upon which smart cities are built. Having clarified in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-sensors-20-05977">Section 1</xref> that smart villages are not extensions of smart cities [<xref rid="B106-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], it is important to understand that the challenges of rural areas differ significantly from those of cities. Hence, smart village development must come with uniquely defined plans and strategies for its development [<xref rid="B107-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p>
