They have two key player groups (universities and journals), which are not in the other networks. First, Universities play a crucial role in communication networks. For example, UC San Francisco, which is the University of California, San Francisco, ranks second, and RoyalCollegeObsGyn, which is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, places sixth. HarvardPublicHealth, which is the public health school of Harvard University, and CCDD at Harvard Chan, which is the Centre for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard, rank 19th and twentieth, respectively. Second, Microbes &amp; Infection, which is the journal covering all fields of infection &amp; immunity, places eleventh, and JAMA, which is the Journal of the American Medical Association, ranks seventeenth. Another characteristic of adults is that people rely on institutes higher than others. For example, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ranks first.</p>
