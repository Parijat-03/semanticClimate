The SYR also draws on the findings of three Special Reports completed as part of the Sixth Assessment &#8211;  Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC).

This report integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports and the three AR6 Special Reports. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being, and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable systems transitions, and climate resilient development pathways. Different regional classification schemes are used for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature.  </span></div><div left="51.02" right="307.95" top="107.11"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 107.11; y1: 116.61; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="107.11" x1="307.95">The Synthesis Report emphasizes near-term risks and options for addressing them to give policymakers a sense of the urgency required to address global climate change.

It also emphasizes how growing urbanization provides an opportunity for ambitious climate action to advance climate resilient development and sustainable development for all. And it underscores how restoring and protecting land and ocean ecosystems can bring multiple benefits to biodiversity and other societal goals, just as a failure to do so presents a major risk to ensuring a healthy planet. </span></div><div left="317.67" right="364.01" top="540.1"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 323.67; y0: 540.1; y1: 552.1; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AAAABF+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.67" y0="540.1" x1="364.01">Structure</span></div><div left="317.67" right="574.62" top="511.52"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 321.89; y0: 511.52; y1: 521.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="511.52" x1="574.62">The SYR comprises a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and a longer report from which the SPM is derived, as well as annexes. </span></div><div left="317.67" right="574.64" top="470.11"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 321.89; y0: 470.11; y1: 479.61; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="470.11" x1="574.64">To facilitate access to the findings of the SYR for a wide readership, each part of the SPM carries highlighted headline statements.
