<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Because the ECHO model is capacity-building, low-cost, and easy to deploy, the CCHH
ECHO has the potential to reach many thousands of people globally due to the
diffusion of knowledge between patients, colleagues, and communities. The human
health effects of climate change is a necessarily emerging field, and increasing
knowledge and communication skills among health practitioners is of critical
importance. Given the climate crisis, a robust climate and health curriculum is
needed in both pre and postlicensure settings for all health professionals. Future
CCHH ECHO telementoring programs may explore avenues to equip health professionals
with the competencies needed to teach climate-related health effects at their own
public health programs and healthcare institutions.</p>
