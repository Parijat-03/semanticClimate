The possibility of having and raising children is a universal and very deep aspect of our self-understanding. Before we procreate, our own lives are the last node in a long genealogy of procreating human beings. By procreating and raising children, we are adding a node and thereby connecting the past and the future and extending the genealogical tree. Having the opportunity to procreate is thus part of our self-understanding of being part of a humanity that not only has a past, but also a future. The continuity of the human species is needed to create the moral community in which we ask moral questions such as what we ought to do to preserve the Earth for the future. In contrast to nonhuman animals, we can think, reason, and deliberate about our procreative behavior. This implies, among other things, that we have the capacity to understand that recognizing the fundamental interest that human beings have in procreating implies that we need to respect that fundamental interest for those human beings who will be alive in the future and that this may put limits on our moral rights to procreate.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn35">35</xref></p>
