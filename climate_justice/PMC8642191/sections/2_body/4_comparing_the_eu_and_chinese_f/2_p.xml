This reflects the fact that the just transition concept has not gained traction in the internal Chinese policy debate. As a unitary state, Chinese policy is not subject to the process of negotiation that characterises the EU, which encompasses 27 Member States with very different per capita incomes and energy mixes. In the context of the intra-EU negotiation, the Just Transition Mechanism was a key &#8216;ask&#8217; of poorer and fossil fuel-reliant Member States that enabled the EU to collectively adopt the ambitions of the European Green Deal. However, just transition is arguably at least as relevant to China as to the EU, given China&#8217;s far greater reliance on fossil fuels and coal in particular. This makes just transition a logical topic for future exchanges and potential collaboration between China and the EU.</p>
