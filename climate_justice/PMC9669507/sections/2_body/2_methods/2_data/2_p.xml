<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To construct our dataset, we draw on a corpus of previously collected news
articles that incorporate predictive information (<xref rid="bibr10-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Diakopoulos, 2022</xref>) and identify a
subset related to COVID-19, which could be in the present or the future (e.g.
projecting the number of COVID-19 cases next month). We specifically sought
articles related to COVID-19 that showed evidence of some computational
technique (i.e. a model that can predict a value, score, or category) or
computer simulation. A total of 27 articles were identified, coming from various
sources including: The New York Times (11), The Economist (6), Washington Post
(3), NPR (2), Time (2), Bloomberg (1), FiveThirtyEight (1), and Reuters (1).
Articles that did not have a comment section or did not allow readers to comment
on the article were excluded from further analysis. Accordingly, only six
articles remained, three articles from The New York Times,<sup><xref rid="fn1-14614448221135632" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> two articles
from the Washington Post,<sup><xref rid="fn2-14614448221135632" ref-type="fn">2</xref></sup> and one article from FiveThirtyEight<sup><xref rid="fn3-14614448221135632" ref-type="fn">3</xref></sup> that fit the
search criteria and enabled readers to comment. All six articles were published
between 19 February 2020 and 28 May 2021 at a time when the world was still
learning about the virus and vaccine efficacy (<xref rid="table1-14614448221135632" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
