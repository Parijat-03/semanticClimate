<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0080">While some of the studies reviewed show potential for social levelling of social hierarchies or socio-economic differences through adaptation efforts (e.g., <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>), the review also reveals gaps in how to facilitate such levelling and &#8220;empowerment&#8221;. Few of the studies we reviewed describe what &#8220;empowerment&#8221; or &#8220;sustainability&#8221; entails in processes of adaptation, beyond describing the potentials of the co-production process. We have identified knowledge gaps in how to evaluate the results of the implementations of adaptation and whether this leads to sustainable practices and action that empower stakeholders. Although, some studies in the corpus highlight the necessity for such an effort. In a study of several adaptation processes carried out through transformation labs in water management in Mexico and India, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones and colleagues (2020)</xref> concluded that these activities allowed the community to move beyond internal conflicts and collectively reflect on what they wanted to conserve. Rather, the transformation labs made it possible to frame the problem as one of &#8220;maintaining the identity and meanings they attached to the Xochimilco wetland in Mexico&#8221; (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020: 211</xref>). The process &#8220;illuminated where power is held&#8221; and how it can &#8220;be mobilized to achieve more just and sustainable development pathways&#8221; (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020: 112</xref>). The authors identify three practical considerations for transformations to sustainability and SDG realization: diverse knowledge, plural pathways, and clearly defined meanings of sustainable adaptation (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020: 1</xref>).</p>
