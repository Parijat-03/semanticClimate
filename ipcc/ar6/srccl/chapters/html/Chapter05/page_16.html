Ozone causes damage to plants through damages to cellular metabolism that influence leaf-level physiology to whole-canopy and root-system processes and feedbacks; these impacts affect leaf-level photosynthesis senescence and carbon assimilation, as well as whole-canopy water and nutrient acquisition and ultimately crop growth and yield (Emberson et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="603.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.15; y0: 603.12; y1: 612.62; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="603.12" x1="307.6">Using atmospheric chemistry and a&#160;global integrated assessment model, Chuwah et al.
