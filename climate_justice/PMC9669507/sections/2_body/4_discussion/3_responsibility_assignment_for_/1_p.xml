interesting pattern in readers&#8217; comments that tend to ascribe responsibilities
and actions to different actors. Commenters even outlined actions that can and
must be taken in response to the pandemic by different actors in society,
government, and the international community on the global level. In a sense,
commenters were engaged in a group planning activity where particular actions
and responsibilities are articulated for future action. Summarizing such group
planning, including using other feedback signals on comments such as &#8220;likes,&#8221;
could be a powerful way to harness the collective future-oriented cognition
