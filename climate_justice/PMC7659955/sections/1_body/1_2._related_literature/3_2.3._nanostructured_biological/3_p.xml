<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Dong et al. [<xref rid="B25-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] introduced a novel nano-structured bio-sensor technique for detecting very low pesticide traces in soil. The technique works by electrochemically reducing Ellman&#8217;s reagent via the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This bio-sensor adopts amperometric, designed to immobilize acetylcholinesterase on multiple walls of carbon-type nanotubes-chitosan nanocomposites modified glassy carbon electrode. High sensitivity of the system is offered by the very good conductivity and biological compatibility of multiple walls of carbon-type nanotubes-chitosan [<xref rid="B25-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This can be additionally improved by electrochemically reducing 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic) acid. In testing the system, methyl parathion pesticide was observed to exhibit an inhibitive effect on acetylcholinesterase. An electrochemical change in the reduction response of 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic) acid was also observed. Overall, the system was found to possess a pesticide detection precision of 7.5 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;13</sup> M when tested on spiked soil. </p>
