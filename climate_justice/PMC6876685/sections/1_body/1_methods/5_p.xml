<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The surveys consisted of Likert&#8208;scale and open&#8208;ended questions, some of which were based on questions from the Pew Research Center (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) survey and the Climate Change in the American Mind survey (Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser&#8208;Renouf, Feinberg, &amp; Rosenthal, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), iterations of which have provided a basis for other climate science education studies (e.g., Holthuis et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In response to a lower&#8208;than&#8208;expected response rate in 2017 (possibly from survey fatigue), we administered a shorter survey in 2018. In this paper, we focus on the student responses to the Likert&#8208;scale questions. In 2017, the premodule survey contained 15 Likert&#8208;scale questions and a validation question, and the postmodule survey contained 16 Likert&#8208;scale questions and a validation question. The 2018 survey shared 7 (beginning of semester) or 8 (end of semester) identical Likert&#8208;scale questions with the 2017 survey. In 2018, the validation question was inadvertently omitted from the premodule survey, but was on the end&#8208;of&#8208;semester survey. The full surveys are provided in the Appendices <xref rid="ece35736-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="ece35736-sup-0007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>.</p>
