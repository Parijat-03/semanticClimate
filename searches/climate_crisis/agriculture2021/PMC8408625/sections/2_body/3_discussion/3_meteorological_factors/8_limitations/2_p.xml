<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0200">Some of the limitations of the study are as follows. Since we were limited to using aggregated data at the NUTS-3 regional level, we cannot make inference about individual-level associations and could not adjust for individual-level risk factors e.g. age, gender, race, and occupation. However, that would be outside the scope of this study, since we were interested in macro ecological and socio-economic trends and drivers. Additionally, we cannot draw causal inference as the methodology we applied only reveals adjusted correlations. Indeed, we would have also liked to include further explanatory variables on avian host and mosquito abundance but were restricted by the availability of data. It is also important to note that data quality issues arise owing to the under-reporting of cases through under-diagnosis, lack of diagnostic tests and a lack of resources/time to carry out and implement mass testing. Another factor we did not consider is bird immunity, which may influence WNV incidence following a major outbreak, although this was not considered an important factor in explaining the rise in WNV infections in Europe, but may have influenced the results. Furthermore, a growing body of literature reports that mammals can serve as intermediate hosts for West Nile virus <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and more research needs to be done to determine if wild mammals act as reservoirs and contribute significantly to the transmission cycle. We also realize that the economic analysis is limited, in part because of a lack of refined data and in part because of scale issues, i.e., the amount of work required to look at individual local level policies and spending was not feasible for 166 regions.</p>
