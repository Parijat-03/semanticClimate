It first examines microfinance in development policy terms (2.1). There, a sum-up of microfinance development goals and perspectives is highlighted. Hence, Section 2.2 approaches the poverty-vulnerability-financial access nexus within the portrayed framework. Hence, the transition from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is marked: Section 2.3 observes the role of microfinance within MDGs, whereas Section 2.4 deals with SDGs. The following section (3) sketches the methodology employed for this work &#8211; i.e. the summative content analysis. Details regarding the methodological choices (3.1) and framework (3.2) are therein provided. Section 4 shows the paper's empirical analysis apropos of access to finance as a resilience policy for making SDGs work. In that section, the content analysis outcomes are presented in detail. Lastly, to conclude, the inquiry deals with the development policy dimensions of the international agreement (Section 5). Namely, Section 5.1 provides an interpretation of the content analysis results in terms of development significance. Following, Section 5.2 refines the emerging concepts and launches some policy perspectives.</p>
