<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Wu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) at the Harvard School of Public Health also suggested that air quality may impact severity of illness in COVID&#8208;19. They found that long&#8208;term exposure to fine particulate matter has been associated with a 15% increase in the COVID&#8208;19 death rate, even after controlling for other health conditions. Although this study did not explicitly link air quality with climate change, further research is needed on this important linkage. In the United States, we have also seen significantly higher rates of COVID rates and COVID morbidity and mortality among Blacks and Hispanics (Price&#8208;Haywood et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to reside in communities with higher rates of pollution and particulate matter (Mikati et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The high rate of COVID mortality in these communities has been attributed to pre&#8208;existing conditions including respiratory illness and poor access to high quality care, but it does appear that climate change may also play a role in the etiology of poor air quality and increasing these disparities.</p>
