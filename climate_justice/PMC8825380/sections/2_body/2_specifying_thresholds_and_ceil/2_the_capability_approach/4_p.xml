The CA has several practical repercussions to policy. First, an aggregated level is not adequate for assessing whether a decision is right, as a loss of someone&#8217;s capabilities cannot be &#8216;compensated&#8217; by raising someone else&#8217;s. Second, a government that does not ensure that all the capabilities can be met performs an injustice on its citizens. That is, if just one capability is not ensured, a government commits a fault of basic justice (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 167). Capabilities are to be understood as minimal entitlements for all individuals by virtue of being humans and having dignity and sociability; accordingly, they have minimal thresholds that no one should fall under.</p>
