00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:35.588
I know, but it gives me a different menu when I'm sharing the screen. We'll come to that in a minute anyway, captions and Beautiful transcript.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:47.640
And now I'm going to release the screen. Oh yeah. Okay. So, Renu, can you tell us?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.040
Exactly what you did. So, what is a good time to start from?

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:16.038
And again, rate like I have read this to put the transcript here like put these into the new discussion.

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.289
So I went there.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.389
Yes.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:33.689
So I try to create the discussion as my good having closed so I created the new discussion. In the general category.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:43.040
No, was it so? What when was it 1st closed? Today? Right, okay.

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:45.839
It's a today today. Today morning I tried to post the like.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:53.739
So, so you went to GitHub to post this into the discussion. And it, and Yes.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.039
Of the 70 climate repository.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.790
And. You got that screen, is that right?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.990
Yes. Currently it is not showing the new button, new discussion, open new discussion. But.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.189
Okay.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:19.990
No, but but let's try and take this. Step by step. So you took the you took a piece of text, right, which is quite large.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.839
Hmm.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.940
No, I not taken the sort of quite large text I have copied all the text in the transfer that so maybe that also

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:28.907
Yeah copied the text in the transcript, right?

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:35.789
Hmm. So this was the, this unit. I'll show you the. It takes to formatted session.

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.589
Sorry.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.639
You took this text, right? Okay. So it's a text file.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:49.139
So this was the test. So I, This call I copied. Hmm.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:57.090
And. You posted that. Into an existing GitHub discussion or a new discussion.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:03.839
No, it's new discussion. It's a discussion slash 12 number discussion.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.140
You open?

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.190
So be very, very clear. You opened a new discussion, is that right?

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.539
Yes.

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:13.789
What was it called?

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:24.689
So I give the title session one. Underscore 11 June underscore for formatted transcript.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:19.989
Brian?

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:33.739
That was a title and then in this. Body part like whatever it is called and then lower substance sections.

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.189
Yeah. Okay.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:43.290
I base the whole. Translate text. And submitted it.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.290
Right. Hey, you submitted it and immediately you got the screen. Is that right?

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:57.339
Alright, so let's be very clear about this. You took a piece of text. Which was, a text file.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.990
Okay, yes.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:12.239
Which we had, created together. As a community, you posted it into a new discussion on GitHub and immediately, your account was suspended.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.439
Yes.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.740
Hmm. They got this messes. What was that? This mass is account suspended.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.689
Is that right?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:28.390
Access to your account has been suspended due to violation of our terms of services. So I. Then I click on the contact support.

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.989
Well.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.139
Okay. Right.

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:50.989
And So it will give me the So. Then sign up, Okay. I did that. Shows me like this so I have not tried to do here and then I found, from the internet, or try to do here.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.740
Yes.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.939
Right?

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.789
And then I found from the internet, the support dot email, like from chat, GPT, I got Okay.

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:01.589
I got to support support at the rate github.com. So there.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:03.039
Yes. And when did you mail them?

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.139
It's not there. Just a minute. I mailed today morning.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:23.189
Yes. Okay, you've done exactly right. What I would say is, The. Clear and more structured your mail to them is.

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:32.939
You know, the, the more, likely, they are to reply and so on.

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:45.539
Okay. So 1st of all, at my. Simpy, right? It's traumatic when something like this happens.

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:36.239
Okay.

00:06:43.288 --> 00:06:57.288
You're behaving responsibly. And you are accused of malpractice. And I don't believe that you could possibly have done anything which merits.

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.589
Hmm.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:15.039
Malpractice. I'm going to hypothesize now. The possible hypotheses are A that they thought this was serious copyright violation.

00:06:59.438 --> 00:07:01.438
Hmm.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:29.590
There is no, there is no copyright violation because it's actually, my speech and unless They have actually felt that it was inappropriate for you to publish this.

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:19.739
Yes.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:42.190
Which is possible. Then, Then, I don't think it's copyright very nice.

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:33.739
Hmm. Yes.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:52.390
We did not quote anybody in this. There is nothing where they can say you have violated, Disney's copyright or whomever it might be.

00:07:52.039 --> 00:08:07.039
So, the second possibility is it contains dialogue. Which is unacceptable to, the GitHub principles.

00:07:53.989 --> 00:07:55.989
Hmm.

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:16.589
Now, we have not discussed anything, I believe, which is inappropriate. We should Look through.

00:08:16.489 --> 00:08:31.489
And one of the difficult things, where machines fail, is that if you are talking about something, then the machine may mistake it.

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:44.789
So if it's reported dialogue. Then you know it is possible, that it's not regarded as reported dialogue but as actual dialogue.

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:54.589
So if I. For example, quote somebody. As coming up with something which is.

00:08:54.139 --> 00:09:09.139
Unacceptable for all sorts of reasons whether it might be hate speech or sexual inappropriateness or whatever, then It's.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:16.589
And this is frequent. This is one reason why automated filters are a very bad idea.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:28.089
Because people cannot design automatic filters which are as good as humans, right? So it's possible that something in the content upset them.

00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:44.288
Copyright or inappropriate content. The 3rd is that it might violate some practice which was not allowed so it could be that it was too big or it was too frequent.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:57.639
Or that there was an intention. To. An intention to, in some way.

00:09:56.288 --> 00:10:08.288
Cause problems, to the site. So, you know, might be seen as a denial of service attack or something of that sort.

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:17.539
So all of these are possibilities. Too big, too frequent. something of that sort.

00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:28.138
Then it's a possibility that your email has been confused with somebody else. Right. Okay.

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:32.489
Do you have more than one GitHub account?

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:37.188
No, I have only one but I created another one today.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:48.039
Right. Okay. That's And what did they do about that? Hey, Is that, where you.

00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:41.788
That this happens. Hmm.

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:53.088
Okay, so another invite is with the semantic climate and one is with my, personal account like the email account.

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:59.789
Right, so you've got a personal one. Have you had any response from GitHub on that?

00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:56.388
And I think.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:09.590
Yes, on the 1st one, the personal one, which I was using earlier. So they have send me the ticket ID for the complaint ticket number.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:17.190
Oh, you've got a ticket number. Okay, can you show us this ticket number?

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.740
Yes.

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:20.039
Yes, I can share it.

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:17.839
So. Yeah, and share the screen.

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.738
Yeah.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:27.739
Hmm. Good. So they have given me some ticket number this.

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:34.839
Okay

00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:47.488
Right, it may be worth

00:12:48.489 --> 00:13:00.489
Yes, it It may, now 1st will renew. I think you should not do any of this because you don't want to be.

00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:18.942
Cut off github again and you don't want the automated system to think that you know you are in some way an irresponsible user right okay I'm also a little bit,

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:16.789
Hmm.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:27.139
Reluctant to do it myself because All of our code is in my repositories. And if they ban me.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:34.990
And the website is also we are running the semantic climate website whatever we are updating it through the

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.589
Then we've got

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.990
Yes. So.

00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:45.439
Have they have they banned the semantic climate site then?

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:48.091
No.

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:53.839
They band, flower, whatever, but not semantic climate, right?

00:13:55.089 --> 00:14:01.089
There's, there's no data ID for the semantic climate. I think the website, yes.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:14:02.139
There isn't. Okay, fine. Right. Okay.

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.639
Right.

00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:13.539
So you'll see that I am. 1st of all, I'm not panicking, right?

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.839
Hmm.

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:18.339
Second day I'm giving you reassurance.

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:21.339
Hmm.

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:27.589
Right, so you've done nothing wrong. you may have,

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:42.239
Overstep something. Without. You know, totally accidentally or it may be that they're software, has inappropriateately banned you.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:49.890
So now what the other people will do with the are they going to do this? Both the sense, other things like similar to our what should they avoid.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:55.389
To profit not facing the situations again.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:59.039
Well. 1st of all,

00:15:00.341 --> 00:15:10.341
So I'm thinking. I will ask my associates about this because they will know this, right?

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:16.989
And. We have.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:25.690
We should be careful what we post to GitHub. Because we don't want to get cut off.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.990
Hmm.

00:15:25.438 --> 00:15:37.438
My guess is that this is a that this is related to your account rather than the content. But, let me read to the content quickly.

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:39.939
Is the content on Slack?

00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:36.738
Hmm.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.139
Yes.

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:44.689
Right, okay. So,

00:15:48.439 --> 00:16:00.439
Let me go to our slack. This is, you know, absolutely. Textbook illustration as to why knowledge.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.990
Thank you.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:12.990
And Management by Closed or but, so is it in coordination, is that right?

00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:06.789
So maybe copyright issue. Copyright issue may be there

00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:14.788
Yes.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.390
Right.

00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:28.439
Is it this one? Yeah, I will share your screen.

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:24.389
You can share the screen.

00:16:27.939 --> 00:16:29.939
Hmm.

00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:47.739
Okay, so is it this one?

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:55.839
Yes, this one. This article is.

00:16:51.939 --> 00:17:01.939
Sorry. This one here. Right. Okay, so.

00:16:57.939 --> 00:17:01.939
Celebrate the. Yes.

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:10.539
I think I have no option but to have to no, but I'm going to read it here.

00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:09.239
You can download this.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.839
Now

00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:13.889
Hmm.

00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:48.089
Right, this isn't today's monologue, it's yesterday's, is that right?

00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:50.089
It's from the 11.th

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.590
I'm near them, okay, right.

00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:55.589
The day before.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.390
Right. That's the complete thing. 71 lines, is that right?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.590
Yes.

00:19:45.738 --> 00:19:48.738
Oh, it's just truncated for display.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:20:08.290
No, it's the same links, okay. Okay. So. Reno, I can't see anything in that which would trigger some violation of the guidelines.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:58.239
Hmm.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.290
Hmm.

00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:12.689
I am.

00:20:14.907 --> 00:20:16.907
I

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:27.539
I'm trying to get through my mind as to why somebody's account would be closed. And.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:34.990
Another one is. And. National security. So if You are from.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:48.240
The certain countries which are called the axis of evil by the united states and they are Iran, North Korea, Cuba and some where else I forget.

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:59.839
If you are from any of those places, then, If you post things, they may be seen as of, a violation.

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:12.039
A violation of security. These countries are not allowed to use US software, for example. But I don't think there's anything in that.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:11.039
Hmm.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:17.289
And I don't think you're, you know, you're likely to be,

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:23.839
Identified. As.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:30.990
So I have to write it in a descriptive email to them. What is step by step? So what I wanted to do and what I did and what I got it.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:32.390
Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:41.490
Yes. You don't need to take more than a line or 2 about it. Just we will do this together.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.590
That is the reason. Yeah, yeah, I'll do this.

00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:41.542
Hmm.

00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:50.239
So, okay, let's, let's dictate this. at the moment.

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:53.539
So

00:21:53.539 --> 00:22:13.539
I am manager of a community projects run between the yeah k and india make that india and uk where we collect How public knowledge and make it semantic.

00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:20.989
We use GitHub both for our code. And for don't.

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:32.339
Our documents are created by us. And we will How, these under a.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:47.340
Okay, under an open license, allowing, a redistribution, there is no known copyright violation in what we do.

00:22:46.639 --> 00:22:58.639
We do not include, any, unacceptable language such as No, start again.

00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:12.939
I am project manager of a, India, UK. Collaboration on software development.

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:23.239
And documents. We use GitHub to manage our code. And our documents and we have

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:32.990
Over 50 users, over a hundred users. Who have been using GitHub for many years.

00:23:32.689 --> 00:23:43.689
Most of us at least 4. Just for many years. We always

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:58.539
Today, give the date and time where you can. We uploaded a document, of our own creation to get hub discussions.

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:11.839
And were met with I. Notice in forming us that we had been. That the account had been suspended.

00:24:12.989 --> 00:24:23.989
We Do not believe we have violated any terms and conditions of GitHub. And we asked to be.

00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:33.339
Reconnected immediately. And to be. Assured that this will not happen again.

00:24:34.939 --> 00:24:42.939
I think that's probably good enough. Okay. Draft it out. And,

00:24:37.089 --> 00:24:39.089
Yes.

00:24:40.739 --> 00:24:42.739
Hmm.

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:52.539
Yeah, draft it out and then come to me and I will also sign it.

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:54.739
Okay. Okay. Hmm.

00:24:56.589 --> 00:24:59.589
Good. Have you mailed their support?

00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:06.139
You've got you've got a ticket. What did you put on your ticket?

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.290
We had just. Yes.

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:11.139
I have to reinstate the word was there in the.

00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:23.089
Okay, Yes. Hmm. Yes, we are that we I am Renu Kumari and this my account has been suspended today.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.240
You ask for reinstatement. That's good. Was it just a single sentence?

00:25:22.489 --> 00:25:35.489
Yep. That's an excellent message, right? Excellent. Okay, I would probably, since you've said that and it's very clear.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:28.790
So please reinstate this account. That's the.

00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:32.439
Yes.

00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:43.289
And you might have been, suspended for some other reason. We don't know.

00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:50.639
So it's, it's probably not a good idea. To send anything more. On that ticket.

00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:45.991
Hmm.

00:25:47.739 --> 00:26:00.739
Yes, because, I send, another email that, another account I created and then, Maybe it is capturing our IP address or whatever it is the same browser.

00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:08.939
So, do you mean saying that this is a duplicate, complaint?

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:22.140
Right. Right, so you've. So this will probably, the ticket will only be with one account, I would think.

00:26:10.139 --> 00:26:13.139
So they are not raised any other ticket.

00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:23.539
Yes, one account.

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:25.639
Is it with the, is it with the flower account?

00:26:24.939 --> 00:26:30.939
Yes, this is for the flower. But I don't know how they capture the same information.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:33.290
Okay, continue on that. We'll see what happens.

00:26:32.339 --> 00:26:39.339
Yeah, maybe we'll wait for a 1 day and then after that time. Hmm.

00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:42.389
I think you've got to wait. they do say that they are, understaffed at the moment.

00:26:43.439 --> 00:26:45.439
Hmm.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:54.590
We will wait and then reply more from on Monday. Maybe I'll do Monday with reference to the ticket.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:27:00.790
I think that's that's a good idea. Now, Is this somebody here?

00:26:57.089 --> 00:26:59.089
Okay.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:18.540
So I've said why I don't want to do it. Could somebody else volunteer, to post this to a discussion and see whether it's the content that is the problem or whether it's the use as the problem.

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:24.339
So their account is, if they're account, So how they are going to handle it.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:37.290
No, what I mean is flower has been suspended and your prior, your other accounts has been suspended.

00:27:33.439 --> 00:27:40.439
Account also. The Renu Kumari, 24 I created the new, user account with the semantic climate.

00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:55.789
Right, okay. So. We're really looking for a volunteer.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.940
Gmail.com.

00:27:56.907 --> 00:28:08.907
To carry this out. I'm also thinking about whether we should move this. Oh,

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:14.290
We should wait. I think we should wait and then because other accounts will be seized again and then. They have to replace the problem.

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:20.589
Because we are working on the Yeah.

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:23.789
Yes. We may need to move to get,

00:28:27.689 --> 00:28:38.689
We may need to move to get lab. Gitlab is much smaller, but it is, And.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:42.039
It's open.

00:28:42.439 --> 00:28:46.439
Hmm. So, so, IS, GitHub is not open.

00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:50.139
It's run by, a Mega Corporation.

00:28:50.889 --> 00:28:55.889
Hi, I thought it is open. Okay.

00:28:51.789 --> 00:29:03.789
No, the contents are Open. But not this software and not the control.

00:28:58.389 --> 00:29:00.389
Hmm. Hmm.

00:29:04.189 --> 00:29:09.189
Okay. Okay, then we can move on.

00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:10.989
So that's us. So I think we might have to.

00:29:11.889 --> 00:29:19.889
So I'm going to share my screen. Am I sharing my screen? Right, so.

00:29:17.738 --> 00:29:19.738
Yes, yes.

00:29:43.738 --> 00:29:45.738
Who's Kitlab?

00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:58.339
Peter we have to leave by the 1530. Because

00:29:54.939 --> 00:30:05.939
I think this is completely screwed everything today. 15, we're coming up.

00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.739
Yeah.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:23.340
We've got a few more, minutes. I was Oh, oh and I haven't I haven't shown the blue right greetings, Well done.

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:07.539
Okay.

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:14.839
It's just Nithika's birthday today.

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:23.539
Yes, so we are going to cut the case. Yeah. Yes. Yes.

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:25.489
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:30:24.439 --> 00:30:26.439
Yeah.

00:30:25.539 --> 00:30:36.539
So that There is my. Can you see the blue? Celebration.

00:30:25.738 --> 00:30:27.738
Hey, D.

00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:29.189
Thank you.

00:30:28.188 --> 00:30:30.188
Okay.

00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:41.839
There you go. Hello. Yes.

00:30:38.238 --> 00:30:40.238
So you're already having the

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:48.539
No, I've been completely thrown by this.

00:30:49.589 --> 00:30:53.589
Yeah, no, I wouldn't want this to happen today.

00:30:52.339 --> 00:30:56.339
Okay. No worries.

00:30:54.639 --> 00:31:04.639
I may need to, I may need to go for a walk. What time actually going to do now is I'm going to

00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:12.907
Well, I've got, you know, we've got to be able to use, this,

00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:16.589
So.

00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:23.289
I'm going to just at least test that I can.

00:31:20.088 --> 00:31:22.088
Yeah.

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:34.539
No. Okay, I'm going to give. 15 min.

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:44.039
Talk about how we create the paper because this is actually describing this process. So, here we go, section.

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:44.239
Hmm.

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:56.039
How we created this paper. This paper consists of, Many hundreds of pages of.

00:31:55.739 --> 00:32:08.739
Text data software and other material. It's primarily stored on the GitHub repository.

00:32:07.489 --> 00:32:21.489
And to Right an account of it, we have used a number of free but not open tools to create it.

00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:32.439
We have daily sessions, in. The zoom protocol in the zoom system. And we.

00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:48.339
Capture the spoken and. Video output. In systems which transcribed this into English text. Zoom has a tool to do this.

00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:57.289
And we also, save the results in the slack system. Which also have a transcriber.

00:32:56.439 --> 00:33:07.439
So the 1st step. Is to record our. Audio. And where necessary video session.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:21.990
And we plan to make this, open notebook available for everybody. We then, take the transcript or transcription created by the automatic system.

00:33:22.089 --> 00:33:31.089
The and, make those available. And post those, particularly on GitHub discussions.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:43.940
Which is which allows for posting and commenting by all members of the GitHub community.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:34:07.490
We then, take that text. And convert it into a summary. Because it's it contains quite a lot of colloquialisms and, Start stops as part of the, monologue, creation process.

00:34:06.589 --> 00:34:31.589
And we turn that into a rough. Transcript, of, the material. And then we are experimenting with summarization to turn it into a concise summary of the process using the

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:48.339
Open source tools such as hugging face to make a summary. Finally, we craft the Translation and summarization, there's transcription and summarization into the final PDF.

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:57.039
Chapter or section for the alias article that we are authoring.

00:34:57.906 --> 00:35:08.906
That article is not a static article. It's an HTML document which can change day by day.

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:22.239
Both after the submission of the, alice article for PDF rendering, and, well.

00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:53.439
Remain as a limit living document for all time. So although the PDF is a static snapshot, of the article, the crew article is a living HTML, Don't, which can be read by the whole world, which can be, commented on using whatever system it's published in, such as, at the moment.

00:35:53.439 --> 00:36:01.439
GitHub, which allows a discussion comments. And so forth.

00:36:02.689 --> 00:36:22.689
We will annotate. The HTML version, with our dictionaries, we will apply doc analysis to come up with the most important terms in that and to link it into entity recognition.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:32.840
And we will also use our own dictionaries to annotate the text and publish those annotations as a growing work.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:51.640
Which will have no fixed end date. The growing work will be strictly versioned. Because the tools we use allow and therefore it will be possible to observe what this document was at any time.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:37:06.390
So we would see this as an extension. Of, Ranganson's final 5th law, which was that the library is a growing organism.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:18.990
We would say that knowledge documents are a continuously growing And there I will finish because I'm.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:28.290
Slightly. Yes, my brains being turned upside down. You are all wonderful.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:38.490
Harshal isn't here, but I would like to discuss with Harshaw, his, Summarization and look at it and so on.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:49.990
And I had hoped to come up with 1st pass of the sectioning. But that's not going to happen today.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.640
Hmm.

00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:54.839
Comments.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:11.640
I think we should practice commenting on github discussions all except Renu who has been banned and see what happens.

00:37:59.889 --> 00:38:01.889
So.

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:10.839
Hmm.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:22.190
To So, can someone attempt to post a publication, a comment on this system.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:33.890
And see if you get banned. For doing it. I know it's, wasteful, but we're going to have to experiment and see.

00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:37.089
At what the extent is.

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:49.339
Maybe they have to open the new account in which they have no other. The . And Because I did the for the same.

00:38:40.439 --> 00:38:46.439
Yes, that's a that's a that's a a good idea to do it.

00:38:47.889 --> 00:38:55.889
Also, I looked up if GitHub allows multiple accounts. So.

00:38:54.089 --> 00:38:56.089
With the same email ID.

00:38:57.289 --> 00:39:05.289
No, on the same machine because I think it remembers the machine and not the email. Because

00:39:03.539 --> 00:39:09.539
I, that may well be true.

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:10.789
Okay. Yes Okay.

00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:19.489
So yeah, it has been mentioned in some places that. More than 1 3 accounts are not allowed by data they suspend if you create more accounts.

00:39:20.908 --> 00:39:22.908
So that's also a thing.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:39.390
That's a very good point. So don't create any more accounts. We I would say comment on what we've got at the moment because it's just possible that it is related to Indian IP addresses or something of that sort.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.090
In the

00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:47.139
Hey, look at the IP address and they may decide that the IP is not acceptable.

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:43.539
Okay.

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:49.839
Hmm.

00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:57.039
Okay. We are all wonderful, and we will see what happens.

00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:59.438
Hmm.

00:39:58.088 --> 00:40:09.088
We're going to change the world for the better. And in 10 years time, people will look back at what we have written now and said, wow.

00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:23.389
I, by the way, I have published something that I wrote. 12 years ago, on my blog, I put it, I think in coordination, have I?

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:28.039
Hmm, yes, I, you have something, I have not seen it, but we'll see it.

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:38.239
No, it's about open access. And why open access was failing then. And you may find some of it useful.

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:42.739
Okay, there we go, Amy.

00:40:43.339 --> 00:40:45.339
Okay.

00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:49.939
W yes.

00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:52.238
You are not have done stop recording and the process

00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:59.639
You are quite right, Reno. So we 1st of all stop the transcript if I can find it.

00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:01.789
SIP transcript

00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:06.489
Where is the transcript?

00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:20.839
Where's my transcript?

00:41:21.907 --> 00:41:24.907
It's under all these windows.

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:48.939
So it was in the zoom windows.

00:41:46.539 --> 00:41:48.539
Yes, I'm

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:56.039
But I'm getting where of, Windows, which might, it was a free floating window.

00:41:56.439 --> 00:42:02.439
That was. I will.

00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:59.239
Hmm.

00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:10.339
You can shoot again the click on the caption button and then so full transcript it will come.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:18.290
Yes, that's fine. Okay, save transcript. Good, we've got that. I do not want to move to Gitlab.

00:42:12.907 --> 00:42:16.907
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:27.539
Okay, then stop recording.
