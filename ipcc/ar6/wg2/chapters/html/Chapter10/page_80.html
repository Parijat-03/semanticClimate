For instance, in building farmers&#8217; resilience, enhancing CCA, ensuring cross-cultural communication and promoting local skills, Indigenous People&#8217;s intuitive thinking processes and geographic knowledge of remote areas are very important.</span></div><div left="60.52" right="542.66" top="637.96"><span x0="60.52" y0="637.96" x1="542.66" style="x0: 60.52; x1: 65.52; y0: 637.96; y1: 646.96; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QGZATX+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">There is also a widespread recognition that IKLK are important in ensuring successful ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). However, this recognition requires more practical application and translation into IKLK-driven EbA projects. For instance, in the Coral Triangle region, creating historical timelines and mapping seasonal calendars can help to capture IKLK while also feeding this information into climate science and climate adaptation planning. Identifying indigenous crop species for agriculture by using IKLK is already identified as an important way to localise climate adaptation: an example is Bali&#8217;s vital contribution of moral economies to food systems which have long built resilience among groups of communities in terms of food security and sovereignty, even with the challenges faced due to modernising of local food systems.</span></div><div left="60.52" right="542.68" top="535.98"><span x0="60.52" y0="535.98" x1="542.68" style="x0: 60.52; x1: 69.02; y0: 535.98; y1: 544.98; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QGZATX+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Many of the pressing problems of Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, deforestation, loss of species, rising coastal hazards and agricultural loss can be effectively negated, or at least minimised, through proper adoption of suitable science and technological methods. Climate-change adaptation is greatly facilitated by science, technology and innovation. This ranges from application of existing science, new development on scientific tools and methods, application of IKLK and citizen sciences. Deploying Knowledge Quality Assessment Tool found significant co-relation between science-based and IKLK framing would help to address, acknowledge and utilise by an integrated approach the wisdom of IKLK, a valuable asset for climate adaptation governance. The IKLK-based environmental indicators need to be seen as part of a separate system of knowledge that coexists with, but is not submerged into, another conventional knowledge system.</span></div><div left="60.52" right="542.65" top="422.01"><span x0="60.52" y0="422.01" x1="542.65" style="x0: 60.52; x1: 63.02; y0: 422.01; y1: 431.01; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QGZATX+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In the context of education and capacity development of climate change, an integrated approach of embracing both the importance of climate science and IKLK is acknowledged. The IKLK is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time. Such as knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts. Engaging communities in the process of documenting and understanding long-term trends and practices will enable both IKLK as well as Western scientific assessments of climate change to contribute in designing appropriate climate adaptation measures.</span></div><div left="60.52" right="124.78" top="715.97"><span style="x0: 60.52; x1: 63.93; y0: 715.97; y1: 723.97; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="60.52" y0="715.97" x1="124.78">FAQ&#160;10.3 (continued)</span></div><div left="60.54" right="155.08" top="283.31"><span x0="60.54" y0="283.31" x1="155.08" style="x0: 60.54; x1: 64.09; y0: 283.31; y1: 291.31; width: 3.55; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; font-family: YUGBBH+FrutigerLTPro-Light;">Frequently Asked Questions</span></div><div left="60.54" right="530.97" top="258.48"><span style="x0: 60.54; x1: 65.17; y0: 258.48; y1: 268.48; width: 4.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="60.54" y0="258.48" x1="530.97">FAQ 10.4 | How can Asia meet multiple goals of climate-change adaptation and sustainable development within the coming decades?</span></div><div left="60.54" right="542.31" top="228.06"><span style="x0: 60.54; x1: 65.71; y0: 228.06; y1: 237.06; width: 5.17; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="60.54" y0="228.06" x1="542.31">Asian countries are testing ways to develop in a climate-resilient manner to meet the goals related to climate change and sustainable development simultaneously. Some promising examples exist, but the window of opportunity to put some of these plans in place is small and closing fast, highlighting the need for urgent action across and within countries.</span></div><div left="60.54" right="542.68" top="186.06"><span x0="60.54" y0="186.06" x1="542.68" style="x0: 60.54; x1: 63.04; y0: 186.06; y1: 195.06; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QGZATX+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In order to achieve the multiple goals of CCA, mitigation and sustainable development, critical are rapid, system transitions across (a) energy systems, (b) land and ecosystems and (c) urban and infrastructural systems. This is especially important across Asia, which has the largest population exposed to current climate risks and high sub-regional diversity, and where risks are expected to rise significantly and unevenly under higher levels of global warming. However, such transformational change is deeply challenging because of variable national development imperatives; differing capacities and requirements of large, highly unequal and vulnerable populations; and socioeconomic and ecological diversity that requires very contextual solutions. Furthermore, issues such as growing transboundary risks, inadequate data for long-term adaptation planning, finance barriers, uneven institutional capacity and non-climatic issues, such as increasing conflict, political instability and polarization, constrain rapid, transformational action across systems.</span></div></body></html>
