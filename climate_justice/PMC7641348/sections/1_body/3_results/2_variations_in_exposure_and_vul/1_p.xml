The median number of daytime and nighttime heat waves projected to occur across census tracts from 2040&#8211;2059 is 10.3 and 17.9 events per year, respectively. This translates to 4.3 more daytime events and 9.1 more nighttime events per year than the current period, on average across census tracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240841.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Daytime events will largely impact the inland regions while nighttime exposure will increase along the coasts. Previous work has shown that, for the heat wave probability density functions, geographic variations in tail length and variance lead to such differing daytime and nighttime heat wave predictions [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Average heat index days per year will increase to a median value of 44.3 events across census tracts, an average bump of 11.6 more days per year than the current period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240841.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
