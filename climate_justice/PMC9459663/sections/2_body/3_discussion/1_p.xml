This association adds to the growing body of literature on the health outcomes of heavy rainfall, which include immediate events (eg, traumatic injury), midterm events (eg, infection and chemical contamination), and long-term events (eg, mental health disorders and malnutrition).<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
