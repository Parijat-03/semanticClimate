<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0110">On the issue of discourse, we argue that labels such as &#8216;climate refugees&#8217; further reinforces a disempowering vulnerability narrative that permits governmental agencies to &#8216;act upon&#8217; people rather than &#8216;act with them&#8217; to mitigate current and future climatic risk. Whereas what is needed is a transformative resilience-based discourse that fosters the self-determination of communities and the agency of individuals in decision making, planning, and implementation, &#8211; as seen in the case of New York residents after Hurricane Sandy (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2018</xref>). Although, this example also suggests that the socio-economic status of affected populations, the lack of information and communication, and the persuasiveness of local mitigation officials, &#8211; can influence the acceptance of retreat, thereby undermining people&#8217;s agency (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">De Vries and Fraser, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
