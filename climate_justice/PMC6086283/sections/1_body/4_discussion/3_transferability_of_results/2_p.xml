According to this research, there is considerable and growing direct interaction of international environmental bureaucracies (macro-level) with non-state actors (micro-level) for implementing international norms and rules (Hickmann and Els&#228;sser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). Specifically, our approach allows us to learn more about the temporal diversity of institutional processes and thus resolve some apparent contradictions within sustainability communities related to techno-scientific and ethical norms. Our approach can also be applied to practical sustainability processes and transformations. It is widely understood that neither these processes nor their outcome can be strictly controlled, &#8220;but the speed and focus can be influenced, aiming to facilitate the process&#8221; (Espinosa and Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>, p. 276). Knowing how to adapt our knowledge to changing realities means to influence the speed of processes in sustainability contexts. This, however, substantially depends on understanding the normative systems behind related decision-making processes (Geden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>; Anderies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Jerneck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>). Confirming this, Sarriot and Kouletio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>, p. 266) consider &#8220;time as a fundamental factor in system adaptation&#8221; when it comes to realizing health projects in multi-institutional SD settings.</p>
