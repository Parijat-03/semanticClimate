This requires that financing for adaptation should come from new and additional resources, and not just relabeled Official Development Assistance (ODA) (Brown et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). There is a climate justice element in this argument &#8211; that poor countries who have had the least contribution to causing the climate change problem bear the greatest costs in adapting to it, and this should be paid for those who created the problem &#8211; e.g. polluter pays principle. For these reasons, there has been considerable attention given to distinguishing adaptation financing from development finance. However even with these measures, the degree to which climate justice is actually being realized in the current governance of adaptation finance has been questioned, noting a certain sidelining of the polluter pays principle, and a strong focus on transparency in the absence of robust systems of accountability (Khan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>).</p>
