Standard initial corpus analyses were carried out for each corpus: the generation of a wordlist (a list of all of the words, or &#8216;types&#8217;, in the corpus, in descending order of frequency); a keywords analysis (a comparison of the wordlists of each of the corpora to show which terms are unusually (in)frequent, or statistically &#8216;key&#8217;); and a clusters analysis, which is similar to a wordlist but it lists the most frequent phrases, or &#8216;n-grams&#8217;, rather than single words. Clusters can be requested with certain parameters, e.g. by asking the program to only return n-grams between two and three words long, for instance, or to retrieve clusters that contain a term of interest.</p>
