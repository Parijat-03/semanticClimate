Floods and extreme events can impact river channel systems (Grainger and Conway, 2014). One of the challenges in South Asia is the shifting boundaries of river channels. For instance, the major floods on the Indus in July 2010 altered the river&#8217;s course in Pakistan, moving it closer to the Indian district of Kutch (Grainger and Conway, 2014). In the eastern tributary of the Ganges system, the alluvial fan of the Koshi River basin has shifted by more than 113 km to the west in the past two centuries (Chakraborty et&#160;al., 2010), which may be due to heavy sediment load from the Himalayan rivers in which about 50&#160;million tons of sediment is deposited annually in the alluvial plains (Sinha et&#160;al., 2019; Chakraborty et&#160;al., 2010).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="570.62"><span x0="54.14" y0="570.62" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 570.62; y1: 580.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asia is no exception to the global trend of lake ecosystems, which provide drinking water to millions of people, being degraded (Jenny et&#160;al., 2020) and severely threatened at the same time by climate change (Mischke, 2020). Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level react dramatically to this threat, and there are negative implications for water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation (Woolway et&#160;al., 2020). Due to substantial regional variability, the quantum of future changes in lake water storage remains uncertain. A recent study (Liu et&#160;al., 2019a) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 500-m spatial resolution global water product data, and applying the least squares method to analyse changes in the area of 14 lakes in Central Asia from 2001 to 2016, has shown that the area-shrinkage changes for all plains lakes in the study region could be attributed to climate change and human activities.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="135.49" top="378.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="378.48" x1="135.49" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 378.48; y1: 388.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.4.4 Projections</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.69" top="354.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="354.6" x1="307.69" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asian and global water demands for irrigation, despite geographic variation in terms of water availability, are </span><span style="x0: 224.39; x1: 228.44; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="224.39" y0="342.6" x1="264.41">very likely </span><span x0="266.66" y0="342.6" x1="307.75" style="x0: 266.66; x1: 269.47; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to surpass supply by 2050 (Chartres, 2014). A regional quantitative assessment (Lutz et&#160;al., 2019) of the impacts of 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C global warming for a major global climate-change hotspot&#8211;the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins (IGB) in South Asia&#8211;shows adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural production, hydropower production and human health. A global temperature increase of 1.5&#176;C with respect to pre-industrial levels would imply a &#8776; 2.1&#176;C temperature increase for IGB, whereas under a 2.0&#176;C global temperature increase scenario, these river basins would warm by &#8776; 2.7&#176;C. Future warming is expected to further increase rain-on-snow events that can cause snowmelt flood during winter (Ohba and Kawase, 2020), affecting hydropower and resulting in river flooding, avalanches and landslides.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="302.78" top="174.62"><span x0="54.14" y0="174.62" x1="302.78" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 56.44; y0: 174.62; y1: 184.12; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the Mekong River Delta (in Vietnam), with an area of 40,500 km</span><span x0="302.77" y0="178.76" x1="305.43" style="x0: 302.77; x1: 305.43; y0: 178.76; y1: 184.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.74" top="162.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="162.6" x1="307.74" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.54; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">and home to 17.8&#160;million people in 2018, climate change is projected to increase the average temperature by 1.1&#8211;3.6&#176;C, and the maximum and minimum monthly flow are projected to increase and decrease, respectively, and are </span><span style="x0: 132.12; x1: 134.23; y0: 126.61; y1: 136.11; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="132.12" y0="126.61" x1="152.68">likely </span><span x0="153.37" y0="126.61" x1="307.75" style="x0: 153.37; x1: 156.18; y0: 126.61; y1: 136.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to result in a high risk of food during the wet season and water shortages during the dry season (Wang et&#160;al., 2021a).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.73" top="78.61"><span x0="54.14" y0="78.61" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.07; y0: 78.61; y1: 88.11; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Researchers have found that the southern Tibetan Plateau has been consistently melting from 1998&#8211;2007 and is projected to continue melting until 2050 (Lutz et&#160;al., 2014b) (</span><span style="x0: 206.93; x1: 211.51; y0: 54.62; y1: 64.12; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="206.93" y0="54.62" x1="265.68">high confidence</span><span x0="265.68" y0="54.62" x1="307.69" style="x0: 265.68; x1: 268.32; y0: 54.62; y1: 64.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).

Local- and regional-scale projections suggest that peak water will generally be reached around the middle of the century, followed by steadily declining glacier runoff thereafter (Hock et&#160;al., 2019). A global-scale projection suggests that a decline in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce basin runoff by about 10% for at least 1&#160;month of the melt season (Huss and Hock, 2018). Significantly, research on climate change and its impact across Asia remains inconclusive and requires an assessment at the sub-regional scale (IPCC, 2014a; Wester et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.71" top="582.64"><span x0="318.18" y0="582.64" x1="571.71" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 582.64; y1: 592.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is a projection of an increase in runoff until the 2050s mainly due to an increase in precipitation in the upper Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween and Mekong basins, where it could be due to accelerated melting in the upper Indus basin. The runoff could increase in the range of 3&#8211;27% (7&#8211;12% in Indus, 10&#8211;27% in Ganges and 3&#8211;8% in Brahmaputra) by mid-century compared with the reference period (1998&#8211;2008) for Himalayan river basins depending on the different RCP scenarios (Lutz et&#160;al., 2014a). Likewise, Khanal et&#160;al. (2021) suggest contrasting responses to climate change for HMA rivers in which, on the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in magnitude and peak of water availability, whereas on the annual scale, total water availability increases for the headwaters. The future flow would increase in Nepal&#8217;s Central Himalaya region (Nepal, 2016; Ragettli et&#160;al., 2016; Bajracharya et&#160;al., 2018). These changes in water availability in space and time will have serious consequences in downstream water availability for various sectoral uses and ecosystem functioning in Asia (Nepal et&#160;al., 2014; Green et&#160;al., 2015; Arfanuzzaman, 2018; Wijngaard et&#160;al., 2018; Rasul and Molden, 2019); however, future water availability is largely uncertain due to significant variation in climate-change projections among different global climate models (Nepal and Shrestha, 2015; Lutz et&#160;al., 2016; Li et&#160;al., 2019a).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.73" top="318.67"><span x0="318.18" y0="318.67" x1="571.73" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.64; y0: 318.67; y1: 328.17; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A recent study (Didovets et&#160;al., 2021) covering eight river catchments having diverse natural conditions within Central Asia, where water availability or scarcity is also a major developmental concern, and using the eco-hydrological model SWIM (including scenarios from five bias-corrected GCMs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) has show an increase in mean annual temperature in all catchments for both RCPs to the end of the 21st century. The projected changes in annual precipitation indicate a clear trend to increase in the Zhabay and decrease in the Murghab catchments, and for other catchments, they were smaller. Both the projected trends for river discharge and precipitation show an increase in the northern and decrease in the southern parts of the study region, whereas seasonal changes include a shift in the peak of river discharge up to one&#160;month, a shortening of the snow accumulation period and a reduction in discharge during the summer months.</span></div><div left="318.18" right="521.27" top="138.69"><span x0="318.18" y0="138.69" x1="521.27" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 138.69; y1: 148.19; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The intensity and frequency of extreme discharges are </span><span style="x0: 522.28; x1: 526.33; y0: 138.69; y1: 148.19; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="522.28" y0="138.69" x1="561.07">very likely </span><span x0="562.07" y0="138.69" x1="571.75" style="x0: 562.07; x1: 564.89; y0: 138.69; y1: 148.19; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to increase towards the end of the century.
