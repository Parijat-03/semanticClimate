<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For a report of IPCC to claim that there is global &#8216;land grabbing&#8217; &#8211; using this politically loaded term &#8211; demonstrates courage, and is laudable. It is probably one of the most significant elements of the report because it brings the conversation right into the very heart of global land politics. The IPCC report states:
<disp-quote specific-use="block"><p>Understanding of land tenure under climate change also has to take account of the growth in large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), also referred to as land-grabbing, in developing countries&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;Land grabs&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;are often driven by direct collaboration of politicians, government officials and land agencies&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;involving corruption of governmental land agencies, failure to register community land claims and illegal land uses and lack of the rule of law and enforcement in resource extraction frontiers&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;The literature expresses different views on whether these acquisitions concern marginal lands or lands already in use&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;Land-grabbing is associated with and may be motivated by the acquisition of rights to water, and erosion of those rights for other users&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;.
