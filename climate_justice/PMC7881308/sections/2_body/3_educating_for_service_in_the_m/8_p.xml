The Anti-Death Penalty Clinic, Australian Law Reform Commission Clinic, Modern Slavery Clinic, and International Economic Law Clinic were developed, and they continue to involve students and supervisors in work for external clients or beneficiaries. Induction and seminar programmes were designed to be conducted online with external partners contributing to development and delivery. These hybrid models were modified to operate entirely online when COVID19 necessitated the closure of on-site operations.</p>
