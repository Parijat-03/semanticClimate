Given that some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in Asia, and the geographies of development are highly uneven, both CIDs and non-climate drivers, such as socioeconomic changes, have contributed to water stress conditions in both water supply and demand in diverse sub-regions of Asia. In the case of Asia, therefore, the entanglement between the non-climate drivers and CIDs makes it difficult to attribute environmental changes&#8212;both present and projected&#8212;neatly and exclusively to CIDs.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.1" top="594.62"><span x0="42.52" y0="594.62" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 594.62; y1: 604.12; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Immerzeel et&#160;al. (2020) have ranked all mountain-dependent water towers according to their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems, societies and economies. The resulting Global Water Tower index indicates that the upper Indus basin is both the most important and the most vulnerable water tower unit (WTU) in the world. A WTU is defined as &#8216;the intersection between major river basins and a topographic mountain classification based on elevation and surface roughness&#8217;. Whereas all important transboundary WTUs in Asia remain highly vulnerable, it is the Indus WTU (inhabited by approximately 235&#160;million people in the basin in 2016 (which is projected to increase by 50% by the middle of 21st century) where the average annual temperature is projected to increase by 1.9&#176;C between 2000 and 2050, with wide-ranging consequences and trans-sectoral spillovers. The Indus WTU faces a deep risk produced by a combination of factors including water stress, ineffective governance, hydropolitical tensions, population growth and density, urbanisation and social transformations, with a significant bearing on SDG 6 on water, SDG 2 on food and SDG 7 on energy.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="124.22" top="366.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="366.48" x1="124.22" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 366.48; y1: 376.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.4.1 Key Drivers</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.12" top="342.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="342.6" x1="296.12" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Across Asia and its various sub-regions, the key drivers behind an increasingly inadequate supply of freshwater resources, affecting the livelihood security of millions, are varied, complex and intersect with multiple social, cultural, economic and environmental stressors (Luo et&#160;al., 2017; Tucker et&#160;al., 2015; Kongsager et&#160;al., 2016).

Conversely, policy interventions aimed at significant augmentation in water-use efficiency across all sectors, ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and a significant reduction in the number of victims of water scarcity, especially the poor and marginalised, could mitigate vulnerabilities caused by climate change. More interdisciplinary research is needed on highly precarious future pathways and the intersection between CIDs and non-climate drivers in order to anticipate and mitigate diverging and uncertain outcomes.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="429.18" top="462.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="462.48" x1="429.18" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 462.48; y1: 472.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.4.2 Sub-regional Diversity</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.15" top="438.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="438.6" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.02; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">According to a quantitative scenario assessment for future water supply and demand in Asia to 2050, based on global climate change and socioeconomic scenarios (Satoh et&#160;al., 2017), water demand in sectors such as irrigation, industry and households will increase by 30&#8211;40% around 2050 in comparison with 2010.
