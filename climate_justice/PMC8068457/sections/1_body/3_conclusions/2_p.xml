Even so, it is expected that by the end of 2020, the annual reduction will only be around 7%, and if no deep structural changes in the economic, transport, and energy systems are made, it is expected that emissions will rise again during the economic recovery (Le Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>).</p>
