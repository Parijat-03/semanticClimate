<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">In the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2019), LULUCF is a GHG inventory sector that covers anthropogenic emissions and removals of GHG in managed lands, excluding non-CO2 agricultural emissions. Following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories and their 2019 Refinement, âanthropogenicâ land-related GHG fluxes are defined as all those occurring on âmanaged landâ, that is, âwhere human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functionsâ. Since managed land may include carbon dioxide (CO2) removals not considered as âanthropogenicâ in some of the scientific literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with CO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories. (IPCC 2006, 2019).</p></dd>
