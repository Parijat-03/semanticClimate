While the shutdown of many sectors of the economy has had environmental benefits in terms of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, few would argue that the socio-economic cost can be justified. But Bill Gates misses the key point that the global lockdown had only a minimal effect on our carbon emissions. A recent study suggests a drop of just 7% in carbon emissions occurred in 2020.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> So, ceasing almost all flying and car journeys has a small impact on our total greenhouse gas pollution. In fact, 2020 global carbon emissions were the same as 2006. This is because there has been very little change to energy production and agriculture during the pandemic&#8212;both major emitters of greenhouse gases. In many ways, this point re-enforces the key chapters of the book that show that energy production, building and manufacturing and agriculture are the greatest emitters of greenhouse gases&#8212;none of which changed much during the pandemic.</p>
