According to the UN, we uphold the principles of social justice when we promote gender equality, or the rights of indigenous peoples and migrants. We advance social justice when we remove barriers that people face because of gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, culture, or disability. Tobacco negatively impacts the human rights of many populations, women, children, racial minorities, and others. Tobacco is a barrier to achieving social justice.</p>
