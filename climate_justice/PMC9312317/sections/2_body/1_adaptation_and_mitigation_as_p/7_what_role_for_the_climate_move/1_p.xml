While social movements may not be a sufficient condition when it comes to redistributing power, they could present necessary conditions for such change (Amenta et al. 2019). In the field of sustainability transformations in particular, political outsiders like social movements are seen as key to enabling transformations because compared to political insiders they are relatively well-positioned to challenge vested interests (O&#8217;Brien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>; Temper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2018</xref>). Social movements&#8212;and climate change movements (CCMs) in particular&#8212;may thus be important and even necessary conditions for the politicization and democratization of adaptation. Crucially though, whether CCMs take up this role has hardly been studied (Zografos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>; Boda and Jerneck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>).</p>
