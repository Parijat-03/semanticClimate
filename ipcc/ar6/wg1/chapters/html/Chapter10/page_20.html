While an assessment of large-scale observations can be found in Chapter&#160;2 (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;2.2 and Section&#160;2.3), this section discusses the specific aspects of the observations at regional scale and over the typological regions considered in the regional chapters (Section&#160;10.1.5).

Supersite observatories are surface and atmospheric boundary layer observing networks that measure a&#160;large number of atmospheric and soil variables at least hourly over a&#160;decade or more, ideally located in rural areas (Ackerman and Stokes, 2003; Haeffelin et&#160;al., 2005; Xie et&#160;al., 2010; Chiriaco et&#160;al., 2018). Adequate calibration of instruments, quality control and homogenization are essential in these sites. They produce valuable data needed to diagnose processes and changes in regional and local climate. Many climate datasets have been developed from in situ station observations, at different spatial scales and temporal frequencies (Annex I: Observational Products). These include sub-daily (Dumitrescu et&#160;al., 2016; Blenkinsop et&#160;al., 2017), daily (Chen et&#160;al., 2008; Camera et&#160;al., 2014; Journ&#233;e et&#160;al.,&#160;2015; Funk et&#160;al., 2015; Aalto et&#160;al., 2016; Beck et&#160;al., 2017a, b; Schneider et&#160;al., 2017) or monthly time scales (Cuervo-Robayo et&#160;al., 2014; Aryee et&#160;al., 2018). Sub-daily data is useful for estimating storm surge (Mori et&#160;al., 2014) or river discharge (Shrestha et&#160;al., 2015), daily data for carbon-stock dynamics (Haga et&#160;al., 2020) or tourism (Watanabe et&#160;al., 2018), and monthly data for beach morphology (Bennett et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="162.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="162.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Satellite products provide a&#160;valuable complement to in situ measurements, particularly over regions where in situ measurements are unavailable. They have been discussed in earlier chapters (e.g.,&#160;Chapters 2 and 8) for large-scale assessment. Currently 54&#160;essential climate variables (ECVs; Bojinski et&#160;al., 2014) are defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program, and passed on, for example, to NASA programmes through the Decadal Survey, to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the European Union, to the ESA Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI, as well as to the international collaborations with geostationary Earth orbit&#160;(GEO) satellites.

The advanced geostationary satellites are: Himawari-8 and 9 (Kurihara et&#160;al., 2016), GOES-East and GOES-17 (Goodman et&#160;al., 2018), Meteosat-10 and 11 (Schmetz et&#160;al., 2002) and FY-4 (Cao et&#160;al., 2014). Geostationary satellite networks or constellations form an essential component of the Global Observation System ( https://www.wmo.int/ pages/prog/www/OSY/GOS.html), providing measurements not only for various cloud properties and moisture but also for air quality, land and ocean surface conditions, and lightning.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="582.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="582.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.13; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, with orbits typically at 400&#8211;700&#160;km, provide advanced measurements of the Earth&#8217;s surface. Sun-synchronous polar orbiters can also cover the polar regions, which cannot be observed with GEO satellites. Examples of LEO observations for land surface monitoring are NASA&#8217;s Landsat (Wulder et&#160;al., 2016), ESA&#8217;s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity Earth Explorer (SMOS) mission (Kerr et&#160;al., 2012), the Sentinel missions of the Copernicus programme, and JAXA&#8217;s ALOS-2 (Ohki et&#160;al., 2019), providing high spatial resolution land surface images. Many kinds of data are accumulated for land use and land cover studies, targeting aspects like urban footprint (Florczyk et&#160;al., 2019), land-cover data (Global Land 30; CCI-LC: ESA, 2021; Chen and Chen, 2018), land surface temperature data (Landsat, Parastatidis et&#160;al., 2017), and&#160;surface&#160;albedo (Chrysoulakis et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.33" top="414.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="414.6" x1="557.33" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Availability of active sensors on LEO satellites enables measurement of microphysical properties of aerosol, cloud and precipitation, which can advance regional climate studies and process evaluation studies to improve regional climate models (</span><span style="x0: 441.17; x1: 445.75; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="441.17" y0="378.6" x1="498.14">high confidence</span><span x0="498.14" y0="378.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 498.14; x1: 500.78; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). An example is the polar-orbiting &#8216;afternoon-train&#8217; satellite constellation (known as the A-train), incorporating Aqua, CALIPSO, Cloudsat, PARASOL, Glory and Aura satellites. Vertical profiling observations from Cloudsat (with a&#160;W-band cloud radar) and CALIPSO (with a&#160;cloud lidar) led to considerable advances in measurements of cloud microphysics (Stephens et&#160;al., 2018). Precipitation and its extremes are essential concerns of regional climate studies. The GPM (65&#176;N&#8211;65&#176;S, 2014&#8211;present) and the preceding TRMM (36.5&#176;N&#8211;36.5&#176;S, 1997&#8211;2015) with Ku-/Ka-band precipitation radars have provided three-dimensional measurements of precipitation with about 5 km resolution and sub-daily sampling (Skofronick-Jackson et&#160;al., 2017). Their non-sun-synchronous observation works to cross-calibrate the constellation satellites to produce global high-resolution mapped products of precipitation, such as Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; Huffman et&#160;al., 2007) and the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP; Kubota et&#160;al., 2007), with hourly sampling at about 11 km resolution. The CPC MORPHing technique (CMORPH) has provided 30 min interval global precipitation with about 8 km coverage since 2002 (Joyce et&#160;al., 2004). Precipitation estimations from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) is a&#160;sub-daily to daily rainfall product that covers 50&#176;S to 50&#176;N globally with 25 km resolution from 2000 to the present (Nguyen et&#160;al., 2019), and is used for semi-global-scale precipitation coverage (Benestad, 2018). TRMM/GPM observations have enabled estimates to be obtained for global four-dimensional convective heating (Shige et&#160;al., 2009; Tao et&#160;al., 2016; Takayabu and Tao, 2020).</span></div></body></html>
