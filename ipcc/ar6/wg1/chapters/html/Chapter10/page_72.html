They can be used for attributing events to different causal factors (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et&#160;al., 2015b; Takayabu et&#160;al., 2015; Trenberth et&#160;al., 2015; Shepherd, 2016a; Section&#160;11.2.4) as well as for exploring the unfolding of events in future climates.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="543.17" top="642.6"><span x0="64.91" y0="642.6" x1="543.17" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.48; y0: 642.6; y1: 652.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Physical climate storylines are complementary to probabilistic or unconditional risk-based approaches, and are particularly suitable to explore low-likelihood changes or events, which are often associated with the highest impacts (Shepherd et&#160;al., 2018; Sillmann et&#160;al., 2020; Section&#160;4.8). They also facilitate providing local context to large-scale trends and changes, by conditioning the projections on locally relevant circumstances (Hazeleger et&#160;al., 2015). Storylines are also developed based on expert elicitation and include plausible changes beyond those simulated by existing model projections in order to explore deep uncertainties (Dessai et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="543.19" top="570.6"><span x0="64.91" y0="570.6" x1="543.19" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Storylines can be combined with impact modelling (Strasser et&#160;al., 2019; Hegdahl et&#160;al., 2020) and can be embedded in a&#160;user&#8217;s risk landscape (Shepherd, 2019; Box&#160;10.2, Figure&#160;1). In particular, this holds for event storylines, where confounding factors such as regional characteristics like land-use changes and non-climatic drivers of the event are an element of the storyline (Pisaric et&#160;al., 2011; Dessai et&#160;al., 2018; Lloyd and Shepherd, 2020; Sillmann et&#160;al., 2021). In a&#160;co-production process, multidisciplinary expert knowledge as well as the values and interests of the intended audiences and stakeholders can be explicitly considered (Kok et&#160;al., 2014; Bhave et&#160;al., 2018; Dessai et&#160;al., 2018; Scott et&#160;al., 2018; Hegdahl et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="543.12" top="486.6"><span x0="64.91" y0="486.6" x1="543.12" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Storylines can also be used to communicate climate information by narrative elements describing the main climatological features and the relevant consequences in the user context (Fl&#248;ttum and Gjerstad, 2017; Moezzi et&#160;al., 2017; Dessai et&#160;al., 2018; Scott et&#160;al., 2018; Jack et&#160;al., 2020). Co-produced narratives have been demonstrated to enhance knowledge integration in decision-making contexts (e.g.,&#160;de Bruijn et&#160;al., 2016). Narrative elements have also been employed to convey information from climate models (Corballis, 2019). Jack et&#160;al. (2020) introduced the concept of climate risk narratives and developed a&#160;set of principles, such as using present tense in their presentation to avoid the effects of future discounting and writing individual narratives without uncertainty language to assume an imagined observer perspective. From this point of view, event storylines are particularly useful for communication purposes as they link to the experience and episodic memory of stakeholders (Schacter et&#160;al., 2007; Steynor et&#160;al., 2016; Shepherd et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="488.75" top="114.98"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.36; y0: 114.98; y1: 122.98; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="114.98" x1="488.75">Box&#160;10.2, Figure&#160;1 | Schematic of two types of physical climate storylines with a&#160;particular climate impact of concern (red). </span><span x0="489.39" y0="114.98" x1="542.78" style="x0: 489.39; x1: 492.8; y0: 114.98; y1: 122.98; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: MQDQUF+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">The storylines are defined by specified elements (dark blue).
