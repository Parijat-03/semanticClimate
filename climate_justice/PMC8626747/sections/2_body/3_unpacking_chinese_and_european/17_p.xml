Located in the rural zone of S&#227;o Luiz, capital of Maranhao&#8217;s state, the Cajueiro territory is formed by five communities (Parnaua&#231;u, Andirobal, Guarimanduba, Morro do Egito and Cajueiro) in the Northeast Amazon. Its population, mainly formed by fishermen, small farmers and extractivists, resisted violent pressure over their territories (Sant&#8217;Ana Junior et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>), especially in 2019, when 200&#160;ha from a total area of 600&#160;ha were already occupied by the local economic actors, without legal authorization, to allow the Chinese investment to build the harbour. There is evidence of land grabbing, falsification of documents and environmental license acquiesce without proper impact studies among the several illegalities seen in this process. Deforestation, air pollution, noise, fragmentation of families, loss of local culture and practices, food insecurity and water scarcity are some of the impacts reported by the Cajueiro&#8217;s residents. Although the land issue has not yet been solved, threats to the community continue, and the structure for carrying out the harbour&#8217;s construction remains in place, such as machinery and private security.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref></p>
