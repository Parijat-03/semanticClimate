These studies were either carried out on regional basis (Thirumalai et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018) or 17 focused on specific countries (Cinco et al., 2014; Villafuerte et al., 2014; Mayowa et al., 2015; Villafuerte 18 and Matsumoto, 2015; Guo et al., 2017b; Sa&#8217;adi et al., 2017; Supari et al., 2017).  19 20 Temperatures are strongly influenced by ENSO in the region, including extreme temperatures. Thirumalai et 21 al. (2017) reported that almost all April extreme temperatures occur in El Ni&#241;o years and that global 22 warming contributed to about half of the warming observed in 2016. In most of Southeast Asia (except for 23 the north-eastern areas), Cheong et al. (2018) detected an increase in the number of warm nights with El 24 Ni&#241;o episodes within the period of 1972&#8211;2010. Over the Philippines, the largest positive anomaly in mean 25 temperatures since the 1960s occurred in 1998 at the end of a strong El Ni&#241;o event (Cinco et al., 2014). 26 27 Changes in mean precipitation are less spatially coherent over Southeast Asia. Over Thailand, Limsakul and 28 Singhruck (2016) analysed station data and concluded that on the average, rain day events have decreased by 29 a rate of &#8211;0.99 days/decade while simple daily intensity has increased by 0.17mm/day per decade. The 30 increase in rainfall extremes and annual total wet-day rainfall are consistent with AR5 findings.  31 32 As with temperature, precipitation is also affected by ENSO events. There has been a significant increase in 33 the amount of maximum daily precipitation with La Ni&#241;a episodes in 1972&#8211;2010, especially during the 34 winter monsoon period between December and February (Cheong et al., 2018). Over the Maritime Continent 35 and Thailand, the likelihood of extreme rainfall events and greater amounts of precipitation are higher during 36 La Ni&#241;a and lower during El Ni&#241;o years (Villafuerte and Matsumoto, 2015; Limsakul and Singhruck, 2016).  37 38 Figure Atlas.30: shows changes in mean temperature and precipitation relative to a baseline period 1980-39 2014 for three datasets (CRU TS, BERKELEY and EWEMBI for temperature; CRU TS, GPCC and GPCP 40 for precipitation). Observation data show that there has been a significant overall warming over SEA with 41 higher rates of warming in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the southern areas of mainland Southeast Asia.  42 Precipitation trends, however, over the region are mostly not significant except for southern Philippines, 43 Malaysia, and East Kalimantan Indonesia. 44 45 It is important to note that the availability, quality, and temporal and spatial density of observation data can 46 introduce uncertainties to the detected changes in historical climate. This may lead to varying results because 47 of the uncertainty in the temporal and spatial characteristics of observations in the region. Juneng et al. 48 (2016) showed root mean square differences (RMSD) in precipitation values of up to 8 mm/day when 49 comparing four different observation datasets available for Southeast Asia. 50 51 52 53 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
