In the IPCC context, reforestation (conversion to forest of land that previously contained forests but has been\nconverted to some other use) is distinguished from afforestation (conversion to forest of land that historically has not contained\nforests; see Glossary). Past expansion of managed forest area occurred in many world-regions for a variety of reasons, from meeting\nneeds for wood fuel or timber (Vadell et al. 2016; Joshi et al. 2011; Zaloumis and Bond 2015; Payn et al. 2015; Shoyama 2008;\nMiyamoto et al. 2011) to restoration-driven efforts, with the aim of enhancing ecological function (Filoso et al. 2017; Salvati and\nCarlucci 2014; Ogle et al. 2018; Crouzeilles et al. 2016; FAO 2016) (Sections 3.7 and 4.9).</td>

China and India have seen the largest net forest area increase, aiming to alleviate soil erosion,\ndesertification and overgrazing (Ahrends et al. 2017; Cao et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2019) (Sections 3.7 and 4.9) but\nuncertainties in exact forest area changes remain large, mostly due to differences in methodology and forest classification (FAO 2015a;\nSong et al. 2018; Hansen et al. 2013; MacDicken et al. 2015).</td>

While reforestation of former croplands increases net ecosystem\ncarbon storage (Bernal et al. 2018; Lamb 2018), afforestation on native grassland results in reduction of soil carbon stocks, which can\nreduce or negate the net carbon benefits which are dominated by increases in biomass, dead wood and litter carbon pools (Veldman\net al. 2015, 2017).</td>

      <td>Forest vs non-forest lands differ in land surface reflectiveness of shortwave radiation and evapotranspiration (Anderson et al. 2011;\nPerugini et al. 2017) (Section 2.4). Evapotranspiration from forests during the growing season regionally cools the land surface and\nenhances cloud cover that reduces shortwave radiation reaching the land, an impact that is especially pronounced in the tropics.\nHowever, dark evergreen conifer-dominated forests have low surface reflectance, and tend to cause warming of the near-surface\natmosphere compared to non-forest land, especially when snow cover is present such as in boreal regions (Duveiller et al. 2018;\nAlkama and Cescatti 2016; Perugini et al. 2017) (medium evidence, high agreement).</td>

      <td>species in semi-arid regions or replacing natural grasslands with forest plantations can divert soil water resources to evapotranspiration\nfrom groundwater recharge (Silveira et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2016). Multiple cases are reported from China where\nafforestation programs, some with irrigation, without having been tailored to local precipitation conditions, resulted in water shortages\nand tree mortality (Cao et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Feng et al. 2016). Water shortages may create long-term water\nconflicts (Zheng et al. 2016). However, reforestation (in particular for restoration) is also associated with improved water filtration,\ngroundwater recharge (Ellison et al. 2017) and can reduce risk of soil erosion, flooding, and associated disasters (Lee et al. 2018)\n(Section 4.9).</td>
