<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite the trend in plaintiffs using litigation as a legal tool for climate action, it remains unclear, from our results and other studies [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], to what extent climate litigation generates new government legislation or policy. This uncertainty is especially pronounced among LMICs, where the frequency of filed cases remains extremely low, representing only 2% (n = 35) of the 360 non-US cases. Notwithstanding the relatively high volume of litigation, North America (including Canada) has passed only 33 climate laws and policies, which is significantly less than the 677 passed in Europe and Central Asia. Whilst outside the scope of this study, analyzing the relationship between existing legal frameworks, breaches of these and numbers of cases brought before courts is an area worthy of further research.</p>
