<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">If we are to improve the mental health of our BAME young people, which is also badly impacted by lack of face-to-face contact, online racism and bullying as well as racism in school, we need those within teaching, the environmental sector and mental health professionals to be ethnically diverse all the way to the top. We also need equal access to nature for everyone but this is changing very slowly. I hope that campaigning by my generation will help change happen.</p>
