When coronavirus was first reported in the nation in mid-March, infection rates per capita quickly became the highest in the country compared with any individual state. Numerous factors led to the rapid spread: disproportionate rates of comorbidities like diabetes, heart conditions, and lung disease, as well as exposure to radiation from abandoned uranium mines. Limited access to healthcare resources also stymied relief efforts. Notably, the nation has been able to curb infection rates through a series of containment measures that led Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to assert that the Navajo Nation&#8217;s coronavirus response should serve as a model for the rest of the country.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref></p>
