MDBs could facilitate the expansion of financial resources by further engaging in structures of blended finance to increase private sector funding, using the tools and experience they have, as well as different financial instruments to address the barriers to expanded private sector finance, particularly risk and asymmetric information. The MDBs are already leading in developing tools and approaches for accounting for climate finance, reducing transactions costs associated with such financing and increasing accessibility of the finance. Here too however, more could be done by expanding the data and capacity for tracking adaptation investments and impacts in recipient countries. Fostering mechanisms to enhance coordination of rural communities and poor people engaged in agri-food system livelihoods is an important means of increasing accessibility of financing which MDBs can promote through investment project design and capacity building. Ensuring that appropriate financial mechanisms are used in adaptation financing, particularly the use of grant financing to incentivize the adoption of new and untried investments as well as investments with low or no financial returns but high returns to social and public benefits is an area where MDBs are already active via co-financing and blending financing arrangements, but here too more is needed.</p>
