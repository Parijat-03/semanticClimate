By documenting disagreements among residents and activists participating in the planning process, the case study shows that differences amongst the community exist along temporal lines &#8211; existing threats to existing environmental amenities versus future risks from climate impacts. This finding adds a temporal dimension to the established divisions between urban environmental groups prioritizing conservation and groups emphasizing environmental justice (Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2009</xref>). Older activists living in market housing prioritized their use of the park as a contributor to their everyday health and social connection, while public housing residents by the coast were willing to forego their short-term use of the park for long-term flood protection in the face of past and future impacts from climate change.</p>
