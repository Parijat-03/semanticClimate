CCL has often been pursued through the international legal pathways of multilateral institutions and the United Nations system, drawing upon such doctrines as The Convention on the Rights of the Child, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Organizations, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, amongst others.</p>
