New York&#8217;s law permits the union to refuse representation in administrative proceedings regarding discipline and in disciplinary interviews also (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1840). Nebraska and Nevada allow unions to charge nonmembers for representation in the grievance process (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1839). Each of these states maintains the requirement that unions fairly represent nonmembers in negotiations.
