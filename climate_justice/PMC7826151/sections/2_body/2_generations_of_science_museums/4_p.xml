These new developments prompted other educational functions of these institutions to come to the fore while their research function, although still very vigorous, slipped further out of public view. For McManus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1992</xref>), the second generation refers to science museums as &#8220;fully functional public institutions&#8221; (p. 160). Under this category, we include the establishment of applied science, technology, and industry museums.</p>
