The Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 gave land grant status to Native American Tribal Colleges and Universities, which created Extension programs. Inequalities between Extension programs persist, however. An Association of Public Land Grant Universities survey revealed that from 2010 to 2012 Extension at 1890 institutions lost &#8220;$57 million due to states not meeting the one-to-one match&#8221; of federal dollars, in contrast to their 1862 counterparts (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>, p. 1). 1994 institutions rely on competitive grants that the National Congress of the American Indian describes as &#8220;grossly underfunded&#8221; (NCAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>).</p>
