For example, how will climate-induced shifts in livestock and crop diseases affect food production and consumption in the future. Investigating the social and ecological consequences of these changes will contribute to decision-making under uncertainty in the future.

These interdependencies are beginning to take into account climate change, food security, and AFOLU assessments (Scanlon et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017). These science advances, in turn, provide critical information for coordinated management to improve the affordability, reliability, and environmental sustainability of food, energy,&#160;and water systems. Despite signi&#64257;cant advances within the past decade, there are still many challenges for the scienti&#64257;c community. These include the need for interdisciplinary science related to the food-energy-water nexus; ground-based monitoring and modelling at local-to-regional scales (Van Gaelen et al. 2017); incorporating human and institutional behaviour in models; partnerships among universities, industry, and government to develop policy-relevant data; and systems modelling to evaluate trade-offs associated with food-energy-water decisions (Scanlon et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="183.59"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 183.59; y1: 193.09; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="183.59" x1="307.55">However, the nexus approach, as a&#160;conceptual framework, requires the recognition that, although land and the goods and services it provides is &#64257;nite, potential demand for the goods and services may be greater than the ability to supply them sustainably (Benton et al. 2018). By addressing demand-side issues, as well as supply-side ef&#64257;ciencies, it provides a&#160;potential route for minimising trade-offs for different goods and services (Benton et al. 2018) (Section&#160;5.6).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="529.03" top="735.01"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 324.29; y0: 735.01; y1: 747.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="735.01" x1="529.03">1.8 Future challenges to food security</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="711.52" x1="566.13">A particular concern in regard to the future of food security is the potential for the impacts of increasing climate extremes on food production to contribute to multi-factored complex events such as food price spikes. In this section, we assess literature on food price spikes and potential strategies for increasing resilience to such occurrences. We then assess the potential for such food system events to affect migration and con&#64258;ict.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="432.79" top="603.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 603.42; y1: 613.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="603.42" x1="432.79">1.8.1 Food price spikes </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="579.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.67; y0: 579.52; y1: 589.02; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="579.52" x1="566.07">Under average conditions, global food system markets may function well, and equilibrium approaches can estimate demand and supply with some con&#64257;dence; however, if there is a&#160;signi&#64257;cant shock, the market can fail to smoothly link demand and supply through price, and a&#160;range of factors can act to amplify the effects of the shock, and transmit it across the world (Box&#160;5.5). Given the potential for shocks driven by changing patterns of extreme weather to increase with climate change, there is the potential for market volatility to disrupt food supply through creating food price spikes. This potential is exacerbated by the interconnectedness of the food system (Puma et al. 2015) with other sectors (i.e.,&#160;the food system depends on water, energy,&#160;and transport) (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015), so the impact of shocks can propagate across sectors and geographies (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015). There is also less spare land globally than there has been in the past, such that if prices spike, there are fewer options to bring new production on stream (Marianela et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="375.55"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 375.55; y1: 385.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="375.55" x1="566.09">Increasing extreme weather events can disrupt production and transport logistics. For example, in 2012 the USA Corn Belt suffered a&#160;widespread drought; USA corn yield declined 16% compared to 2011 and 25% compared to 2009. In 2016, a&#160;record yield loss in&#160;France that is attributed to a&#160;conjunction of abnormal warmness in late autumn and abnormal wet in the following spring (Ben-Ari et al. 2018) is another well-documented example. To the extent that such supply shocks are associated with climate change, they may become more frequent and contribute to greater instability in agricultural markets in the future. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="243.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.09; y0: 243.56; y1: 253.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="243.56" x1="566.07">Furthermore, analogue conditions of past extremes might create signi&#64257;cantly greater impacts in a&#160;warmer world. A&#160;study simulating analogous conditions to the Dust Bowl drought in today&#8217;s agriculture suggests that Dust Bowl-type droughts today would have unprecedented consequences, with yield losses about 50% larger than the severe drought of 2012 (Glotter and Elliott 2016). Damages at these extremes are highly sensitive to temperature, worsening by about 25% with each degree centigrade of warming. By mid-century, over 80% of summers are projected to have average temperatures that are likely to exceed the hottest summer in the Dust Bowl years (1936) (Glotter and Elliott 2016).</span></div></body></html>
