<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Broadly speaking, CE is an economic system whereby all types of waste are reduced through the continuous use of resources (Lacy et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), CE replaces the traditional Linear Economy that wastes materials once they have been used. CE is also based on the preservation and enhancement of natural capital, planning out waste, and lengthening the circulation of materials and products. CE is thereby defined through specific actions and practices such as eco-design, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing (Nasr and Thurston, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), repair and product sharing (Chertow and Ehrenfeld, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Schr&#246;der et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
