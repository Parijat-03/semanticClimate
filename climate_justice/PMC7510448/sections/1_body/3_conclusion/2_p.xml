It requires thinking through complex allocation challenges, such as addressing extreme concentrations of wealth in industrialized and middle-income countries and international redistributions of wealth and opportunities to help countries in the Global South to protect their populations against the catastrophic consequences of climate change. Addressing these allocation challenges head-on, both within and between countries, is critical to realizing pro-poor planetary justice. However, such challenges are not sufficiently addressed nor prioritized in the five approaches to earth system governance that we have examined here.</p>
