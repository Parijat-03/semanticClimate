<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The global climate of land politics is currently defined by a strong aversion to any state-driven, class-based redistributive land policies, and an ideological obsession with privatization of land rights as the main thrust, and land sales and rental markets as the main mechanism for reallocating access to and use of land. Four mutually reinforcing political acts emanating from a single social force and ideology have converged to construct and maintain the current structure of the global land politics architecture: <italic toggle="yes">roll back</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">contain</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">block</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">promote</italic>. These are wilful, orchestrated actions by social groups within the state and in society in pursuit of particular socioeconomic and political interests.</p>
