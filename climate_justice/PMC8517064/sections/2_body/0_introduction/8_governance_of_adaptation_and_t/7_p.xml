To date, 75% of countries&#8217; Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) have adaptation targets, including 100% of African countries and 92% of Asian countries. Water, agriculture, and health are the sectors most frequently identified as &#8220;key priority sectors&#8221; and &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; in the NDCs (see FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016b</xref><underline>).</underline> The Koronivia Joint Work Programme on Agriculture established under UNFCCC in 2017 is also generating calls for adaptation actions which will likely be reflected in increased emphasis on agriculture and land-use change in the revision of countries&#8217; Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) expected for 2022 (Chiriac&#242; et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>).</p>
