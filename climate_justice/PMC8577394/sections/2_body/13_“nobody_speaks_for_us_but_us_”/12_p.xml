After all, the lives of many activists might not go on long enough to see the worst impacts of climate change, and the squeeze on affordable housing in the LES means their children might not experience flooding in lower Manhattan either. But the activists, as self-identified political progressives, often talked about the importance of climate change. Specifically, they questioned the carbon emissions implications of the new plan. They would ask: How could the city claim to care about climate change if they were willing to remove almost a thousand carbon dioxide-sucking trees from a park, or approve a plan that kept carbon-spewing cars choking the FDR Drive? Third, activists could also be worried about the ESCR project affecting housing prices. It is true, as we have seen earlier in the article, that residents are concerned about a new public amenity further rising rents in the LES. But this issue existed in the previous iteration of the plan as well, and activists did not use this as a motivation to paralyze the plan.</p>
