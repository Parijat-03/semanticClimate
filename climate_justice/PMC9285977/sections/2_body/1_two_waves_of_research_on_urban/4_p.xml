<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We used two analytical strategies to examine this set of articles. First, we read those moments of acceleration as responses to radical changes in the international climate regime, to characterize them as &#8220;waves&#8221; in the literature on climate governance. The objective was to relate developments in the academic field with policy debates on climate change. Second, we sought to reveal the thematic changes occurring across the two waves. Taking as reference a previous review of the field by one of the authors (Cast&#225;n Broto, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0084" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), we coded each paper to reflect different areas of interest including the presence of keywords (mitigation, adaptation, resilience, smart cities, etc.), the kind of actions presented (community&#8208;based adaptation, planning, green infrastructure, etc.), and the methodologies used in the paper (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, other). The coding was iterative. Rather than fixing the coding categories on the first round we refined them over three interactions until a map of five dominant themes emerged. Those five themes, summarized in Table <xref rid="wcc643-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, have structured the analysis in the rest of the paper. After both analyses were completed, we conducted a further review of the papers to examine the variation on the themes between the two waves (see also Table <xref rid="wcc643-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
