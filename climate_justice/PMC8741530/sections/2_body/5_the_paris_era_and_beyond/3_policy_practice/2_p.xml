For instance, China issued three bilateral joint statements on climate change with the USA and the EU, which paved the way for the success of the Paris Summit. In the three statements, the three sides made their relatively strong commitments, agreed to reach &#8216;a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties&#8217; (European Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Foreign Ministry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>), and supported to include an enhanced transparency system with reporting and reviewing framework in the Paris outcome (Foreign Ministry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). Their efforts laid the basis for the historical agreement and many wordings of these statements were even directly adopted by the agreement (Tiberghien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>).</p>
