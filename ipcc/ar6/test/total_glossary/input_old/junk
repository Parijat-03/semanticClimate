In contrast to the other monsoons it extends quite far north, out of the tropical belt, and it is largely influenced by subtropical systems and by disturbances from the mid-latitudes. The EAsiaM manifests during boreal summer with warm and wet southerly winds, but also during boreal winter with cold and dry northerly winds. In late April/early May, rainfall onsets in the central Indochina Peninsula, and in mid-June the rainy season arrives over East Asia with the formation of the Meiyu front along the Yangtze River valley, Changma in Korea and Baiu in Japan. In July, the monsoon advances up to North China, the Korean peninsula and central Japan. During boreal winter, strong north-westerlies manifest over north and north-east China, Korea and Japan, while strong north-easterlies arrive along the coast of East Asia. Further details on how EAsiaM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Global monsoon" data-phraseid="4690">Global monsoon</span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>

GHG neutrality is often assessed over the lifecycle, including indirect (‘scope 3’) emissions, but can also be limited to the emissions and removals, over a specified period, for which the subject has direct control, as determined by the relevant scheme. The quantification of GHG emissions and removals depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric<br><br>[Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are overlapping concepts. The concepts can be applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global scale, the terms greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, while GHG neutrality generally includes emissions and removals within and beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity.

Its variance is maximum in winter and its pattern has a strong regional expression in the North Atlantic being strongly correlated with the <em>North Atlantic Oscillation</em> index. The NAM is also known as the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In its positive phase, the NAM is characterized by anomalously low pressure over the Arctic and high pressure over the mid-latitudes/subtropics, with a strengthening of the zonally averaged westerly winds on their polar flank that confines colder air across the Arctic. The negative NAM phase is characterized by a more distorted wind pattern and jet meanders that increase storminess in the mid-latitude regions.

Extreme poverty is itself a poverty trap since poor persons lack the means to participate meaningfully in society. In economics, the term poverty trap is often used at national scales, referring to a self-perpetuating condition where an economy, caught in a vicious cycle, suffers from persistent underdevelopment (Matsuyama, 2008).

Changes in their <em>emissions</em> can also induce long-term <em>climate</em> effects via, in particular, their interactions with some biogeochemical cycles. SLCFs are classified as direct or indirect, with direct SLCFs exerting climate effects through their <em>radiative forcing</em> and indirect SLCFs being the <em>precursors</em> of other direct climate forcers. Direct SLCFs include <em>methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</em>, <em>ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</em>, primary <em>aerosols</em> and some halogenated species. Indirect SLCFs are precursors of ozone or secondary aerosols. SLCFs can be cooling or warming through interactions with radiation and clouds. They are also referred to as near-term climate forcers. Many SLCFs are also air pollutants. A subset of exclusively warming SLCFs is also referred to as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), including methane, ozone, and <em>black carbon (BC)</em>.</p></dd><div>

Changes in total alkalinity in the oceans can result from a variety of biogeochemical processes that affect the acid–base composition of the seawater itself. However, its value is not affected by the exchange of carbon dioxide gas between seawater and the atmosphere. Measurements of total alkalinity can thus be used to help study these biogeochemical processes and can also be used to help calculate the state of the seawater acid–base system. Total alkalinity is most commonly measured using an acidimetric titration technique that determines how much acid is required to titrate a seawater sample to a specified equivalence point.</p></dd><div>
