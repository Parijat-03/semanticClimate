      <td>Gender is a key axis of social inequality that intersects with other systems of power and marginalisation &#8211; including race, culture,\nclass/socio-economic status, location, sexuality, and age &#8211; to cause unequal experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptive\ncapacity. However, &#8216;policy frameworks and strong institutions that align development, equity objectives, and climate have the potential\nto deliver &#8220;triple-wins&#8221;&#8217; (Roy et al. 2018), including enhanced gender equality. Gender in relation to this report is introduced in Chapter\n1, referred to as a leverage point in women&#8217;s participation in decisions relating to land desertification (Section 3.6.3), land degradation\n(Section 4.1.6), food security (Section 5.2.5.1), and enabling land and climate response options (Section 6.1.2.2).</td>

      <td>Focusing on &#8216;gender&#8217; as a relational and contextual construct can help avoid homogenising women as a uniformly and consistently\nvulnerable category (Arora-Jonsson 2011; Mersha and Van Laerhoven 2016; Ravera et al. 2016). There is high agreement that using\na framework of intersectionality to integrate gender into climate change research helps to recognise overlapping and interconnected\nsystems of power (Djoudi et al. 2016; Fletcher 2018; Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Moosa and Tuana 2014; Thompson-Hall et al. 2016),\nwhich create particular inequitable experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. Through this framework, both\ncommonalities and differences may be found between the experiences of rural and urban women, or between women in high-income\nand low-income countries, for example.</td>

      <td>In rural areas, women generally experience greater vulnerability than men, albeit through different pathways (Djoudi et al., 2016; Goh,\n2012; Jost et al., 2016; Kakota, Nyariki, Mkwambisi, &amp; Kogi-Makau, 2011). In masculinised agricultural settings of Australia and\nCanada, for example, climate adaptation can increase women&#8217;s work on- and off-farm, but without increasing recognition for\nwomen&#8217;s undervalued contributions (Alston et al. 2018a; Fletcher and Knuttila 2016). A study in rural Ethiopia found that male-headed\nhouseholds had access to a wider set of adaptation measures than female-headed households (Mersha and Van Laerhoven 2016).</td>

      <td>Due to engrained patriarchal social structures and gendered ideologies, women may face multiple barriers to participation and\ndecision-making in land-based adaptation and mitigation actions in response to climate change (high confidence) (Alkire et al. 2013a;\nQuisumbing et al. 2014). These barriers include: (i) disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic work, including care-giving\nactivities (Beuchelt and Badstue 2013) and provision of water and firewood (UNEP, 2016); (ii) risk of violence in both public and private\nspheres, which restricts women&#8217;s mobility for capacity-building activities and productive work outside the home (Day et al., 2005;\nJost et al., 2016; UNEP, 2016); (iii) less access to credit and financing (Jost et al. 2016); (iv) lack of organisational social capital, which\nmay help in accessing credit (Carroll et al. 2012); (v) lack of ownership of productive assets and resources (Kristjanson et al., 2014;</td>
