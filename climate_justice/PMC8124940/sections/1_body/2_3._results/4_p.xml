<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Results from the GEE using September UHRI as the dependent variable (<xref rid="ijerph-18-04800-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) indicate a significantly positive association with the proportions of children and literate residents (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and a negative relationship with the proportions of SCs, households with assets, and households of larger size (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). A one standard deviation increase in the proportion of children and literate residents is associated with approximately 54% and 91% increases in values of the September UHRI, respectively, while a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of SCs, households with assets, and households of larger size is associated with about 58%, 66%, and 45% decreases in the September UHRI, respectively. Although the proportions of agricultural workers and households with electricity revealed significantly positive and negative coefficients (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), respectively, in the GEE for the May UHRI, both these variables yielded non-significant coefficients (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in the GEE for the September UHRI.</p>
