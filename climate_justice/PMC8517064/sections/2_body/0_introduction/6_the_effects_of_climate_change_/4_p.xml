For example, in Ethiopia, Auci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>) find that the poorest farmers suffer the greatest decreases in crop-based income due to changes in water availability, since they had the lowest level of income diversification. Asfaw &amp; Maggio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>) found that in Malawi, significant increases in seasonal temperatures over the historical average had a detrimental effect on overall consumption (-17.9%), food consumption (-29.8%) and caloric intake (-22.2%). These negative effects were even greater for households headed by women. Interviews in rural communities in the Peruvian Amazon (including indigenous communities) revealed that damage to crops and livestock from fires associated with changes in temperature and rainfall patterns was the top risk to livelihoods (Chavez Michaelson et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Recent research by Alfani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>) in rural Zambia shows that households affected by the drought experienced a decrease in maize yield by around 20 percent, as well as a reduction in income up to 37 percent. Among adaptation practices adopted, those that led to better resilience included livestock diversification, income diversification, and the adoption of mechanical erosion control measures which increased water retention. Mechanical erosion control measures, which include soil and water conservation techniques, have been shown to have similar shock buffering impacts in rural Tanzania (Arslan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>).</p>
