<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0024">Finally, specific attention to climate change's impacts on PLHIVs can usher the development of new models of care for HIV/AIDS especially in climate-vulnerable geographic areas in the Philippines. For instance, ART is becoming increasingly accessible to Filipinos, as it is already provided in more than 160 government and private treatment facilities situated around the country. However, without anticipatory planning and if supply chain management is not strengthened, ART supply may be disrupted by climate-related extreme weather events. Climate-proofed HIV/AIDS treatment programs will ensure that medication adherence is not interrupted and that disease outcomes for PLHIVs are not worsened despite being affected by such climate-induced calamities.</p>
