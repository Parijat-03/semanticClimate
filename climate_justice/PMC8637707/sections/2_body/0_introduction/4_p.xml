for health professionals. In February 2021, University of New Mexico's Project ECHO
launched a CCHH program for training postlicensure health professionals. The goals
of the CCHH ECHO were 3-fold: to increase health professionals&#8217; (1) knowledge, (2)
self-efficacy, and (3) communication skills related to human health impacts of
climate change. Evaluation of this program can help to inform effective strategies
for preparing health professionals to understand and communicate the impacts of
climate change.</p>
