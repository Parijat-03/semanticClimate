In July 2020, the European Council simultaneously agreed to the EU&#8217;s 2021&#8211;2027 budget (MFF) and its &#8364;750 billion pandemic response instrument, NGEU. The Council targeted a recovery that repaired the damage caused by COVID-19 &#8216;whilst supporting the Union&#8217;s green and digital priorities&#8217; (European Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>, 2). As discussed above, the Just Transition Mechanism draws funding from both the budget and NGEU. However, the &#8216;mainstreaming&#8217; of climate across both the MFF and NGEU is far broader. The Council set a &#8216;climate target&#8217; of 30% of MFF and NGEU expenditure (Ibid, 7).</p>
