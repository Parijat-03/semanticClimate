Coarse-scale simulations of future permafrost conditions in high mountains are fraught with dif&#64257;culties in capturing &#64257;ne-scale variation of topography, surface cover and near-surface materials (Section&#160;2.2.4). Improved cross-disciplinary studies bringing together current observation and modelling approaches in each speci&#64257;c &#64257;eld hold potential to contribute to addressing these gaps in the future.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.93" top="603.54"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.31; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="603.54" x1="312.93">Experiences with changes in water availability, and with changes in frequency and/or magnitude of natural hazards, demonstrate the relevance of integrated approaches to understand past impacts and prepare for future risks, where exposure and the underpinning existing vulnerabilities of mountain socioecological systems in&#64258;uence the extent of these impacts (Section&#160;2.3.2.3). However, there is insuf&#64257;cient understanding of the effects of cryospheric change on some natural hazards such as glacier outburst &#64258;oods and on infrastructure, for example for transportation. Increased wild&#64257;re risk with a shrinking cryosphere is an uncertainty both spatially and temporally and with consequent effects on mountain ecosystems, particularly with respect to soil carbon and potential biome shifts. Overall, few studies have taken a comprehensive risk approach to systematically characterise and compare magnitude and extent of past impacts and future risks across high mountain regions, including compound risks and cascading impacts where instances of deep uncertainty in responses and outcomes may arise (Cross Chapter Box&#160;5 in Chapter&#160;1).

In some cases, the changes can be linked, for example, where a receding glacier creates new habitat, but rising air temperature allow some species to establish that would not otherwise be able to. A major research gap is in our understanding of the fate of legacy pollutants such as mercury downstream of their release from glaciers and permafrost in terms of quantity and regional differences, freshwater sinks, and potential effects to ecosystems and human health. Similarly, the effect of permafrost thaw on water quality and ecosystems due to the increasing release of natural heavy metals and nutrients represents a gap in knowledge.</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.49" top="531.58"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 331.0; y0: 531.58; y1: 541.08; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="531.58" x1="571.49">While adaptation measures are reported for high mountain cryosphere changes (Figure&#160;2.9 a), it stands as a relatively new and developing area of research since AR5 (Figure&#160;2.9 b), with particular gaps in terms of systematically evaluating their cost-bene&#64257;ts and long-term effectiveness as &#8216;&#64257;t-for-purpose&#8217; solutions in the mountain context. Improved inter-comparability of successful adaptation cases, including the transferability of evidence for how adaptation can address both climate change and sustainable development objectives in different mountain regions, are prospects to support an evidentiary basis for future assessments of adaptation to cryosphere changes in the high mountains (Adler et al., 2019; McDowell et al., 2019).</span></div><div left="65.5" right="164.19" top="339.01"><span style="x0: 65.5; x1: 72.84; y0: 339.01; y1: 351.01; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLHNB+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.5" y0="339.01" x1="164.19">Acknowledgements</span></div><div left="65.5" right="311.89" top="315.52"><span style="x0: 65.5; x1: 73.07; y0: 315.52; y1: 325.02; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.5" y0="315.52" x1="311.89">We acknowledge the kind contributions of Matvey Debolskiy (Unversity of Alaska Fairbanks, USA), Florian Hanzer (University of Innsbruck, Austria), Andreas F.
