Importantly, in several Asian cities, flood and drought risk is expected to occur concurrently, especially in South Asia which is projected to see the largest increase in urban land exposed to both floods and droughts (25&#8211;32% increase in flood and drought risk between 2000 and 2030).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="216.2" top="474.63"><span style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.7; y0: 474.63; y1: 484.13; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="54.14" y0="474.63" x1="216.2">10.4.6.3.4 Sea level rise and coastal flooding</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.87" top="450.64"><span x0="54.14" y0="450.64" x1="307.87" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.96; y0: 450.64; y1: 460.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Global assessments identify Asia as the most exposed region to SLR (see Section CCP2.2.1) in terms of the number of people living in low-elevation coastal zones and the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100-years storm surge events (Neumann et&#160;al., 2015; Jevrejeva et&#160;al., 2016; Kulp and Strauss, 2019; Abadie et&#160;al., 2020; Haasnoot, 2021). Twelve of the top 20&#160;countries exposed to SLR and associated flood events are in Asia, and of these, China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure (Neumann et&#160;al., 2015; Edmonds et&#160;al., 2020). Critically, regardless of the emissions scenario, 70% of the global population exposed to SLR and land subsidence are in eight Asian countries: China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Japan (Kulp and Strauss, 2019). This is particularly worrisome since in highly populated low-lying coastal cities across Asia, it is estimated that land subsidence could be as influential as climate-induced SLR over the 21st century (Cao et&#160;al., 2021; Nicholls et&#160;al., 2021). In East Asia and the Asia&#8211;Pacific in general (expected to see 0.2&#8211;0.5 m SLR), without adaptation, 1&#160;million people (range of 0.3&#8211;2.2&#160;million) are projected to be affected by submergence under RCP8.5 by 2095. Limiting warming will reduce this risk, and under RCP4.5, these numbers of people at risk will be reached by 2140. However, continuing on RCP8.5 increases risk exposure to 7&#160;million (estimated range of 2&#8211;24&#160;million people) (Haasnoot, 2021). Notably, assuming present-day population and adaptation (in the form of existing protection standards), East and South Asia already have a large number of people at risk of a 1-in-100-years flooding event (63&#160;million) because of relatively lower flood protection (except in China and Malaysia).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.87" top="126.68"><span x0="54.14" y0="126.68" x1="307.87" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.36; y0: 126.68; y1: 136.18; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">These global scenarios will have significant impacts on national and subnational populations.

With a 2&#176;C warming, Guangzhou is expected to see SLR of 0.34 m; under 5&#176;C warming, this number would rise to 1.93 m. A more recent estimate calculates expected damage in Guangzhou due to SLR under RCP8.5 to reach 331&#160;billion USD by 2050 and 420&#160;billion USD under the high-end scenario with figures doubling by 2070. By 2100, expected damage could reach 1.4 trillion USD under RCP8.5 and 1.8 trillion USD under the high-end scenario. Similarly, in Mumbai (India) SLR damages amount to US$ 112&#8211;162&#160;billion by 2050 and could increase by a factor of 2.8&#8211;2.9 by 2070 (Abadie et&#160;al., 2020). In coastal cities such as Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, projected land subsidence rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction, are comparable to, or exceed, expected rates of SLR, resulting in an additional 0.2 m SLR by 2025 (Jevrejeva et&#160;al., 2016). In Shanghai, current annual damage by coastal inundation is estimated at 0.03% of local GDP; under RCP4.5, this increases to 0.8% by 2100 (uncertainty range of 0.4&#8211;1.4%) and is further exacerbated by land subsidence and socioeconomic development (Du et&#160;al., 2020). It is important to note that these projections assume (a) no adaptation and (b) that damage repairs are undertaken and completed annually. Given these assumptions, while these estimates communicate the scale of projected impacts, they are indicators of possible damages in the absence of adaptation and </span><span style="x0: 430.53; x1: 435.11; y0: 306.63; y1: 316.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="430.53" y0="306.63" x1="444.78">not </span><span x0="444.78" y0="306.63" x1="510.56" style="x0: 444.78; x1: 449.18; y0: 306.63; y1: 316.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">actual projections.</span></div><div left="318.33" right="572.05" top="282.64"><span x0="318.33" y0="282.64" x1="572.05" style="x0: 318.33; x1: 322.55; y0: 282.64; y1: 292.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The SLR affects economic growth, its drivers and welfare outcomes (Hallegatte, 2012; Pycroft et&#160;al., 2016; Lee and Asuncion, 2020) through (a) permanent loss of land and natural capital, (b) loss of infrastructure and physical capital, (c) loss of social capital and migration, (d) temporary floods, food insecurity and loss of livelihoods and (e) added expenditure for coastal protection.
