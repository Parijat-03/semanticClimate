What is telling here is that the WEF&#8217;s reference to systemic discontent, lacking mention of deepening austerity and involuntary migration, masks the dispossessions and deprivations of privatization, corporate privilege and financialization. Allusion to a legitimacy crisis of multilateralism in fact <italic>reframes</italic> the shock doctrine in such a way as to enable the spectre of corporate capture to address evident global risks (Canfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). By 2020 this spectre materialized with the COVID-19 pandemic exposing not only a &#8216;broken food system&#8217;, but also profound public incapacities, further compromising multilateralism. In this moment Klaus Schwab, founder of the WEF, and co-author of <italic>The Great Reset</italic>, opined:<disp-quote><p id="Par7">The connectivity between geopolitics and pandemics flows both ways. On the one hand, the chaotic end of multilateralism, a vacuum of global governance and the rise of various forms of nationalism make it more difficult to deal with the outbreak&#8230;On the other hand, the pandemic is clearly exacerbating and accelerating [prior] geopolitical trends that were already apparent before the crisis erupted (Schwab and Malleret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>: 8, 44).</p></disp-quote></p>
