      <td>There is a small, but growing literature on quantitative pathways to achieve normative visions and their associated trade-offs (IPBES\n2018a). Whilst the visions themselves may be clearly articulated, the societal choices, behaviours and transitions needed to attain\nthem, are not. Better accounting for human behaviour and decision-making processes in global scale land-use models would improve\nthe capacity to quantify pathways to sustainable futures (Rounsevell et al. 2014; Arneth et al. 2014; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018).\nIt is, however, difficult to understand and represent human behaviour and social interaction processes at global scales. Decision-making\nin global models is commonly represented through economic processes (Arneth et al. 2014). Other important human processes for\nland systems including equity, fairness, land tenure and the role of institutions and governance, receive less attention, and this limits\nthe use of global models to quantify transformative pathways, adaptation and mitigation (Arneth et al. 2014; Rounsevell et al. 2014;\nWang et al. 2016). No model exists at present to represent complex human behaviours at the global scale, although the need has\nbeen highlighted (Rounsevell et al. 2014; Arneth et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2017; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018).</td>
