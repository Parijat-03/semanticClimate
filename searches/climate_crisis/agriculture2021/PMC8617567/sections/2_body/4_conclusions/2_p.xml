We employed the GTWR models to examine the effects of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, wildfires, and the wildfire&#8208;induced air pollution on three metrics that describe people's mobility to parks, including the number of visits per capita, their dwell time at parks, and the travel distance to park. Our findings suggested a general trend of avoidance to the parks, with fewer visitors and dwell time in the places with high COVID&#8208;19 cases, which is likely due to people's infection protection behavior and risk attitude. However, in June, with the movement restriction orders just lifted, some long&#8208;distance travels to parks were observed in some counties in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado. We also found that people tended to travel further and spend longer time at the parks away from wildfires with less smoke, especially during the major wildfire seasons between August and September. Our findings are helpful to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of human recreation and social behaviors under multiple severe crises, which can support the preparation and mitigation of future threats to people's health and wellbeing.</p>
