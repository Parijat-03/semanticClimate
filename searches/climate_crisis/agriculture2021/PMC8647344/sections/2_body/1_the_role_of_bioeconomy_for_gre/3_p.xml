However, although many researchers claim that the bioeconomy is circular by nature (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stegmann et al., 2020</xref>), it is of high importance to underline the &#8220;circularity&#8221; principles if we want to avoid business-as-usual. A circular economy requires minimizing waste, maintaining the value of products, materials, and resources for as long as possible (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2015</xref>). Stegmann et al. defined circular bioeconomy as giving emphasis &#8220;<italic>on the sustainable</italic>, <italic>resource-efficient valorization of biomass in integrated</italic>, <italic>multi-output production chains</italic> (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <italic>biorefineries</italic>) <italic>while also making use of residues and wastes and optimizing the value of biomass overtime via cascading</italic>.&#8221; (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stegmann et al., 2020</xref>). To ensure a rapid and simultaneously efficient transition, a combination of actions, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and increased financial resources must complement the already provided significant amounts of public and private funds worldwide mobilized through stimulus packages, promoting the sustainable circular bioeconomy (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, supporting the small-scale local biorefineries should be a priority as they comply with rural development, and exploit opportunities for resource-efficient repayment chains and leverage, specific strengths within their respective, and settings (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou and Singh, 2020</xref>).</p>
