<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0020">Since 2010, WNV has been reported in 14 EU countries including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain; and has also been reported in five neighboring EU candidate countries including Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Kosovo <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In 2010, major outbreaks hit Greece, Hungary, Romania, and Turkey. Since then, outbreaks have occurred annually in multiple regions, including more northerly regions that had not previously reported cases, like Germany and the Czech Republic (see <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This culminated in another major outbreak in 2018, that affected more regions than had been recorded in previous years.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Koppen&#8211;Geiger (CG) Climate Classification in study regions.
