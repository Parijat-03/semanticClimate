People and communities differ in their exposures, inherent sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to respond to and cope with climate events [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Presently, the literature suggests that while new forms of climate-influenced mental health impacts are emerging, such as &#8216;eco-anxiety&#8217; and &#8216;solastalgia&#8217;, climate change predominantly aggravates existing risk factors and conditions, disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, and further taxes already strained mental health services [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These psychological impacts worsen overall health, diminish productivity, and reduce quality of life.</p>
