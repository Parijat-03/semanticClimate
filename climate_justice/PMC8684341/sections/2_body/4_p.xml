<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par5">Mar&#237;lia de Nardin Bud&#243;&#8217;s review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>) certainly identifies a major gap in my analysis. She notes that the discussion of the role of corporations and capitalism in processes of nature-destroying colonization lacks an understanding of both androcentrism and anthropocentrism. The corporation is a product of Western rational thinking that can conceptualize nature only in commodified terms, and the book maps this point out. But what is missing is a deeper critical engagement with rational thinking that exposes systematic patriarchy and speciesism. She is right: those perspectives are missing, and the analysis is weaker for it. The role of caring, social reproduction, subsistence production&#8212;in short, the reproduction of life&#8212;is critical to the story of the devouring of nature by Western corporations. Indeed, just as social reproduction is hidden in masculinist anthropogenic accounts, so is the leading role of women in peasant and Indigenous resistance movements across the planet (Barca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). To argue that colonialism was and remains the key driver in capitalism&#8217;s unrestrained devouring of nature is to imply that all systems of human organization and of reproducing life were eradicated in its wake. The book only scratches the surface of this. But by accepting this approach, we also must agree that the ontological separation of humans from nature is a founding myth upon which early modernity&#8217;s scientific revolution was based (Moore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). We must overcome this ontology if we are to have any chance of breaking the endless cycle of environmental destruction in capitalist social orders.</p>
