As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, these attain their highest level in 2010. However, the most striking data is found in 2007 in Scopus: with only 3 articles registered, the total number of citations rises to 400. This is due to Reuveny&#8217;s work entitled <italic>Climate change-induced migration and violent conflict</italic> (371 citations) in which the conflicts that arise with the arrival of climate migrants in new territories are addressed. In fact, it is the most widely quoted article on Scopus. In contrast, the WoS database contains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] research entitled <italic>The first climate refugees? Contesting global narratives of climate change in Tuvalu</italic> (177 citations) which addresses the concept of climate refugees.
