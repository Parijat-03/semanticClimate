<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our data here consist of news comments made in response to predictive journalism
articles about COVID-19. We chose to focus on news comments as they contribute
to the deliberative public discourse and offer a rich stream of data for
understanding public reactions (<xref rid="bibr12-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Eisele et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Lee and McElroy,
2019</xref>). At the same time, comments do not reflect all news readers (<xref rid="bibr14-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Friemel and D&#246;tsch,
2015</xref>), and therefore, our analysis of comments should not be
interpreted as some reflection of public opinion or the general population but
rather reflects only the population of commenters studied. Although there are
sometimes issues with the quality of news comments (<xref rid="bibr34-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Santana, 2014</xref>) including issues of
incivility, hate speech, and rude language (<xref rid="bibr7-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Hughey and Daniels, 2013</xref>), prior
research has shown that people tend to conform to standards of thoughtfulness
set by others in online commenting communities (<xref rid="bibr16-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Han and Brazeal, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Sukumaran et al.,
2011</xref>). In addition, in comparison to comments on social media, research
has found that comments on news websites have more deliberative quality than
those on social media outlets (<xref rid="bibr33-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Rowe, 2015</xref>). As our results here show,
we did not encounter substantive quality issues with the data we collected.</p>
