These include a &#8364;72.2 billion &#8216;Social Climate Fund&#8217; to &#8216;alleviate the social and distributional burden from the price impacts of the [proposed] emissions trading for the sectors of buildings and road transport&#8217; (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021e</xref>, 3). While the ultimate outcomes of the &#8216;Fit for 55&#8217; proposals cannot be predicted, they do indicate that as climate policy becomes more ambitious and encompasses a broader range of economic activity, the need to address questions of fairness becomes correspondingly greater.</p>
