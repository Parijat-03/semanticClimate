level, actions were ascribed to either the <italic toggle="yes">government, collective
society</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">individual</italic> (or
<italic toggle="yes">personal</italic>) actors. Comments ascribing actions and
responsibility to the <italic toggle="yes">government</italic> are requesting actions to be
taken by the state or federal governments in response to the virus. Examples of
actions include, but are not limited to, increasing testing capabilities as one
commenter stated, &#8220;Our nation does not have testing kits available for everyone.
We need multiple tests for each person in America.&#8221; Another action that was
requested in the comments in the form of a suggestion is to reopen closed
military facilities as hospitals to treat infected individuals, &#8220;Beyond
increased testing, what is being done to expand capacity to support the surge in
hospitalizations?. Build new hospitals in 10 days as China did? Reopen closed
military facilities to quarantine infected individuals?&#8221;. In addition, some
comments were also demanding further clarification on health strategies to
handle COVID as one commenter puts it, &#8220;. . . I don&#8217;t disagree with the current
strategies, but I would like to hear CDC epidemiologists give modeling updates
frequently and not just tell us what to do, but keep explaining why&#8221;.</p>
