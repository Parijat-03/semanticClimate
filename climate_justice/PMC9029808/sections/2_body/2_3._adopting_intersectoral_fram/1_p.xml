<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The increased recognition that climate change is jeopardizing human rights, including the universal right to health, especially those of marginalized communities has brought scholars and the OHCHR to call for the adoption of a human rights-based approach to address climate change (HRBA) [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A HRBA responds to the dimensions of climate justice and the need to develop mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as loss and damage frameworks, that put those who are disproportionately impacted by climate change at the center [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. When implemented through a human rights lens, mitigation and adaptation measures are designed for and with the participation of the most vulnerable, following the principles of human rights law [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As illustrated by the recent reports of the IPCC, a HRBA can help reduce structural vulnerabilities to climate change by addressing structural inequities linked to age, gender, ethnicity, disability, location, and income through providing the most marginalized and affected with capacity building, meaningful participation and inclusion, and targeted resources, financing, and policies to better adapt and build resilience [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, when using a HRBA, the human rights legal framework can assist right holders to hold governments accountable if their climate policies result in, or normalize, human rights violations against individual citizens and communities, including to their right to health [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For example, in February 2020, German youth filed a plaintiff against Germany&#8217;s Federal Climate Protection Act claiming it was violating human rights, specifically the right to life and physical integrity, as well as the rights of future generations, by not requiring sufficient short- and medium-term emission reductions [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The Court ruled in favor of the complainants, ordering the legislature to establish further emission reduction targets as &#8220;subsequent generations [would otherwise be forced to] a drastic reduction burden and expose their lives to serious losses of freedom&#8221; [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In another case, the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled in favor of Indigenous communities claiming that the pollution of the Atrato river was a violation of their rights to life, health, water, food security, healthy environment, culture, and land property and requested the government to assess all mining and energy policies against the effects of climate change in order to protect human rights [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
