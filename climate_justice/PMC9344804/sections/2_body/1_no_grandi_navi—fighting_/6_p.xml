However, the committee does not advocate against the presence of tourists as such. The problems it tries to address concern the political management of the environmental and social consequences of tourism and the Port Authority&#8217;s way of governing the shipping industry. The <italic>Comitato </italic>expresses its goals in its slogan, its name, its symbol, and its messages and actions. The slogan is clear and straightforward: &#8220;Ships out of the lagoon now and forever&#8221; (&#8220;<italic>Fuori le navi dalla laguna ora e sempre</italic>&#8221;). It also reinforces this idea visually. Its distinctive symbol, a&#160;crossed-out ship, communicates the demand to ban big ships. In its diagnostic and prognostic framing, the committee explicitly positions itself against big ships in the present as well as the future. In its argumentation, <italic>No Grandi Navi</italic> emphasizes the disproportionality of a&#160;giant ship against the backdrop of a&#160;mid-sized city and its natural and urban environment. The disproportionate and &#8220;monstrous dimension&#8221; (Mancuso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>: 156) of the &#8220;spaceship of &#8216;the modern&#8217;&#8221; (Settis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>: 110) is one of its central arguments. Above all, it is the route of the ships that has been, and still is, the focus of political mobilization (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Simplified map of Venice, lagoon and mainland Venice (picture by Janine Schemmer)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="48_2022_340_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e522"/></fig></p>
