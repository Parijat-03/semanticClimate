<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Land is a key input in economic production and a dump or sink for the waste generated by production. It is directly associated with the causes of and responses to climate change, a substantial part of which is linked to agriculture and food, thereby implicating rural land politics. But the nature of the link between climate change and land is not uncontested. For example, a neoliberal notion of land as input in production and a sink for waste (World Bank, <xref rid="CIT0109" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) is fundamentally different from agroecology&#8217;s perspective (Rosset &amp; Altieri, <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Past reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) touched on this issue, but generally focused on the biophysical aspect of the relationship. However, the 2019 IPCC special report, <italic toggle="yes">Climate Change and Land</italic>, broke new ground (IPCC, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This report covers a wide range of themes, from biophysical to land tenure issues, and has bravely flagged the subject of global land grabs. This in itself is a huge accomplishment. But with this achievement come pitfalls. The report embraces &#8216;land tenure security&#8217; as its principal framework for land-based climate change mitigation and adaptation, but it remains silent on what this actually means for land-based social relations in today&#8217;s socially differentiated societies. This is a major Achilles&#8217; heel inasmuch as &#8216;securing&#8217; land tenure in the context of high inequality is likely to become an exercise in ratifying what already exists, that is, interpreting and implementing the framework in a way that reinforces undemocratic social structures and institutions that also happen to significantly contribute to climate change.</p>
