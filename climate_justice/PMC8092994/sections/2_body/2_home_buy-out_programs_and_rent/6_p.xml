Most renters&#8217; insurance does not include events like flooding (unless an additional flood insurance policy is purchased) and the property owner&#8217;s insurance does not cover any of the renters&#8217; property nor temporary relocation (Sachon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). Insurance often provides a means for the property owner to rebuild and recover, but no such benefits are transferred to the renter. The Flood Mitigation Assistance Program can provide funds to reduce the risk of flood damage, but the property must be insured pursuant to the NFIP. Lack of NFIP insurance, in some cases, could mean that the property does not qualify for buy-out even if it has flooded multiple times. Lack of NFIP insurance also means that there may not be available records or information of prior flooding for a property, making it more difficult for a renter to determine such risk. If a renter is not aware of whether the rental property has flood insurance, is in a high-risk flood zone, or whether it has flooded before (as noted, typical requirements for a home buy-out program (Adler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>)), this places the renter at a disadvantage before he/she even enters the lease.</p>
