In addition to the experts from the concerned department/ministry, the working groups had participation of experts from the Science and Technology, academia, research, NGOs and Civil Societies. The working groups were sensitised with the climate change issues in Delhi. Orientation for approach and methodology to be followed in the preparation of SAPCC was conducted in early March 2011. Deliberation and discussions were made in subsequent months which were used as the guiding principle in formulating the action plan for various sectors. Extensive consultations within the working group members and other concerned stake holders were carried out from 2011 to 2018.
