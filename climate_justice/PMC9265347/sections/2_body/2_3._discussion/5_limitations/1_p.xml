<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We acknowledge several limitations of the pilot study. First, due to logistical constraints, the allocation of classes to the intervention and control groups was carried out decentrally by teachers. While this might influence parameter estimates by affecting baseline balance between the study arms, we do not anticipate negative impacts on the other study objectives that are not contingent on unbiased effect estimates. For the effectiveness study, a blinded trial statistician will carry out the randomisation of classes to study arms using state-of-the-art techniques [<xref rid="B68-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Second, the study is constrained by a short follow-up period of one month. While this follow-up is suitable for observing changes in pro-environmental intentions, it is presumably too short to observe changes in some secondary endpoints, including climate change-related self-efficacy or values and norms [<xref rid="B69-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. To examine both short- and medium-term effects of the PCS, we aim to conduct two follow-up surveys after 1 and 12 weeks in the future effectiveness study.</p>
