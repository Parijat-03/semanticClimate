Macintyre et al. [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found nighttime temperature to range by 3.1 &#176;C across deciles of the IMD index within West Midlands, UK. Low-income and elderly populations also typically have lesser ability to mitigate heat effects by accessing green spaces and cooling centers [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
