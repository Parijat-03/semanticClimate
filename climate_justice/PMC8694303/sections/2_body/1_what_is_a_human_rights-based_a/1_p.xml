First, it requires that climate change policies and actions be both responsive and targeted to address the basic human rights of all, but especially those of the most vulnerable and those who suffer most from climate change.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Second, it indicates operational principles that should be followed by policy makers when designing and implementing climate-related policies (see <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
