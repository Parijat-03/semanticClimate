However, this strategy can create conflict with neighboring states where air quality is adversely affected by high-polluting states. To mediate this conflict between states, the Obama Administration enacted the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule to limit the drift of airborne pollution across state borders. This policy quickly became a contested terrain between states and the federal government over jurisdiction, and it was resolved by the federal government making concessions to high-polluting states (Prechel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2012</xref>). Economic co-dependence also results in other actions by states that benefit the fossil fuel industry. To illustrate, several Republican lawmakers in Texas recently proposed legislation that threatened to divest the state&#8217;s more than $100 billion in retirement funds from banks and asset managers that boycott the fossil fuel sector (Douglas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>).</p>
