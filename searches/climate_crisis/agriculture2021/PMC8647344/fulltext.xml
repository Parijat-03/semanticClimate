As the world has placed hope on the vaccination progress to bring back the socio-economic &#x0201c;normal,&#x0201d; this article explores how the bioeconomy can enhance the resilience and sustainability of bio-based, food, and energy systems in the post-COVID-19 era. The proposed recovery approach integrates technological innovations, environment, ecosystem services, &#x0201c;biocities,&#x0201d; food, rural economies, and tourism. The importance of integrating culture, arts, and the fashion industry as part of the recovery is underlined towards building a better bioeconomy that, together with environmental safeguards, promotes socio-cultural and economic innovations. This integration could be achieved supporting communities and stakeholders to diversify their activities by combining sustainable production with decarbonization, stimulating private investments in this direction and monitoring the resulting impact of mitigation measures. Food systems should become more resilient in order to allow adapting rapidly to severe crises and future shocks, while it is important to increase circularity towards the valorization of waste, the integration of different processes within the biorefinery concept and the production of bio-based products and biofuels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0010"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0010" position="anchor"><alt-text id="al0020">Unlabelled Image</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1_lrg"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Bio-based</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy</kwd><kwd>Food</kwd><kwd>Resilience</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="mi0005">Editor: Huu Hao Ngo</p></notes></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0295">The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 has caused a devastating health crisis and global socio-economic disruption due to the repetitive lockdowns that restricted humans' activities.

For instance, the demand for alcohols and textiles increased rapidly due to the urgent need for disinfectants, facemasks, and sterile medical clothing manufacturing (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2021</xref>). A significant disruption in forest management and forestry sector activities has also been observed in some areas (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, the need for single-use packaging materials, wrappings, and plastics, which have already started to increase before the pandemic, shows a steady demand highlighting the dynamic for bio-based plastic alternatives in the future (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2021</xref>). Due to the restricted mobility and transport, the respective demand for fuels decreased and, in civil aviation, almost collapsed, though air freight increased. The pandemic's first wave reduced oil price even to negative values, triggered by projections that oil demand would fall by 8.4 mb/d up to the end of 2020 compared to 2019. This trend led to a lack of inland storage availability and led to almost 50 billion &#x020ac; write-downs during the second trimester of 2020 (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2020</xref>). US and EU oil majors have so far adopted different strategies. US companies sustain the conventional business (under Trump's Administration), while the European are more active in reducing fossil fuel consumption. Moreover, investments in innovative technologies for the bioenergy sector declined within 2020 due to the lower fossil fuel prices and the challenging economic environment (e.g., lower cash flows, reduced demand, higher debts, and decreased profits) (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0305">Up to January 2021, the economies' transition in the post-COVID-19 era remains uncertain as the pandemic has not been controlled yet. By the end of the autumn of 2020, the so-called 2nd pandemic wave has reached most countries, causing a new cycle of horizontal lockdowns. Given the present uncertainties in distribution, acceptance, and efficiency of COVID-19 vaccination programs, the pandemic might continue up to the end of 2021, and a 3rd wave cannot be ruled out. Subsequently, the resilience of our food, energy, and material supply systems is at stake, and mitigation measures are widely debated. The experiences obtained from the previous &#x0201c;<italic>Black Swan</italic>&#x0201d; events of the last two centuries (e.g., the Spanish Flu of 1918&#x02013;1920, and World War II) indicate that the societies resolve respective consequences with enormous creativity, adaptation to innovative pathways, and massive changes to tackle austerity (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Rowan and Galanakis, 2020</xref>). The crisis had occurred when the flaws of the current systems of production, transformation, and consumption were already evident (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Gerten et al., 2020</xref>). The exceptional measures taken to recover our economies from the crisis can be turned into opportunities for &#x02018;building back better&#x02019; and fostering the transition to a new economic system (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2021</xref>). The pandemic has revealed the need to redesign the global systems to minimize their vulnerability and build on local self-sufficiency. This is vital to prepare for future crises in flows of food, energy, and other goods, and above all, place citizens' wellbeing and the planet at its heart (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="p0310">We believe that the &#x02018;circular bioeconomy&#x02019; concept can be a crucial component of this transition, based on a mix of disruptive social and technological and social innovations. The current article discusses how the bioeconomy can provide an outlet to the global economies to recover from the pandemic, increase resilience, and prepare for new &#x0201c;Black Swan&#x0201d; events in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>The role of bioeconomy for green recovery and resilience in the post-pandemic era</title><p id="p0315">As nations organize vaccination plans to tackle the pandemic and apply recovery measures to foster their economies, society should focus on building resilience and maintaining ambitions for zero&#x02011;carbon futures. This direction reinstates the circular bioeconomy and biobased products and services on the cornerstone of strategic decision making. This trend has been long pursued by the US Biopreferred program to spur economic development, create new jobs and provide new markets for farm commodities. The Program was designed by the 2002 Farm Bill and reauthorized and expanded as part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2021</xref>). Just a couple of months before the COVID 19 outbreak, the European Union announced the European Green Deal's for a climate-neutral economy by 2050 (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2019</xref>), which also acknowledges the shift from a linear bioeconomy to a circular bioeconomy and promotes changes in policy frames. China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea also announced similar climate-neutral economy plans within 2020 (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Schiermacher, 2020</xref>).

However, although many researchers claim that the bioeconomy is circular by nature (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stegmann et al., 2020</xref>), it is of high importance to underline the &#x0201c;circularity&#x0201d; principles if we want to avoid business-as-usual. A circular economy requires minimizing waste, maintaining the value of products, materials, and resources for as long as possible (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2015</xref>).

To ensure a rapid and simultaneously efficient transition, a combination of actions, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and increased financial resources must complement the already provided significant amounts of public and private funds worldwide mobilized through stimulus packages, promoting the sustainable circular bioeconomy (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, supporting the small-scale local biorefineries should be a priority as they comply with rural development, and exploit opportunities for resource-efficient repayment chains and leverage, specific strengths within their respective, and settings (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou and Singh, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0325">To facilitate the efficient green economic recovery, these should be sustained and further enriched with other nature-based solutions such as reforestation, agroecology, and interventions for low-carbon development, as recommended in most of the studies among the 130 ones revised by <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Burger et al. (2020)</xref>. The additional stimulus can facilitate improvements in agricultural value chains that promote biodiversity and sustainable food systems. These include incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) in production, construction of low-energy buildings and protection of natural assets, and off-grid rural electrification, among others. New business models, new production and consumption patterns, new social norms, and new governance schemes could emerge. Emerging innovations could also support manufacturing and food industries in production (e.g., carbon farming, climate-smart forestry) and processing (e.g., automation of food production with robotics) systems (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, the decentralization of food systems and biorefineries (e.g., by utilizing smart specialization funding schemes that promote the model of &#x0201c;biocities&#x0201d;) could secure smallholders, enterprises, farmers, and customers (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

Subsequently, the need for energy security and local resilience through low carbon solutions is prominent. Renewable energy from solar power and wind are intrinsically variable in time and available. Although it cannot replace thoroughly conventional fuels, bioenergy can provide stand-alone energy generation that will smooth the peaks related to the other forms of variable renewable energies. Through bioliquids and biofuels, it is nowadays strongly regarded as an ideal alternative for aviation, marine, and heavy-duty transports, sectors with fewer decarbonization options (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou et al., 2021</xref>) and offers system energy balancing services, as in district heating and electricity systems (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Arasto et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, facilitating energy security within the framework of the circular bioeconomy can be achieved through investments that prioritize local bio-based value chains (e.g., biofuel production processes) and promote supply from domestic regions (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Lange et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0350">The circular bioeconomy offers excellent possibilities to integrate biochemical and thermo-chemical processes in local biorefineries that can valorize residues and co-products of upstream routes, produce multiple biobased products, energy, and fuels; thus improving circularity<sup>6</sup>.

Besides, biofuel's role in the markets can be even more critical if a higher penetration of electricity in transportation is achieved in the future.

In contrast, non-metallic minerals such as sand or gravel account for around half of the extracted resources (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">IRP, 2019</xref>). Scalable innovations and viable technologies could be deployed to produce resource-efficient, circular, and low carbon solutions based on renewable energy and sustainability sourced bio-based materials. A good example is a first-ever car made of nanocellulose, a biomaterial five times lighter and stronger than steel, produced in Japan in 2019.

This presents risks and opportunities. Necessarily, harvesting in forests to meet demands for biomass must not be a driver for deforestation and must not exceed those forests' capacity to grow more biomass and so renew the losses. Sustainable forest management (SFM) also recognizes requirements to maintain soil and water quality, conserve biodiversity, protect habitats, and respect for local/indigenous communities. However, even meeting the highest SFM standards cannot necessarily address all the goals of bioeconomy development. An increased intensity of harvesting in forests can negatively impact forest carbon stocks and sequestration, effects which may be temporary or may last for centuries, depending on the specific circumstances (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Camia et al., 2021</xref>). As part of optimizing forest management, such negative impacts need to be avoided or their consequences minimized or rapidly ameliorated. Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Verkerk et al., 2020</xref>) places the aim of increasing wood supply alongside adapting forest ecosystems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change risks and the overall aim of reducing GHG emissions.

The circular bioeconomy offers a unique opportunity for building decentralized energy production and water and landscape management. It supports the natural capital and improves biodiversity by promoting agroecological farming (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al., 2020</xref>), re-establishing organic carbon and microbiota in the soil and land, recycling nutrients, and contributing to climate mitigation.
