<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate justice can be considered on global and local scale: on a global scale, for example, by demanding the discontinued use of fossil fuel and transferring funding from north to south for payment of ecological debt based on historical responsibility [<xref rid="B104-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]; on a local scale, by designing public health policies and interventions to enhance the resilience of the most disadvantaged populations to climate change and its consequences [<xref rid="B105-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. One example would be to increase the urban green space in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, but co-designing, from the outset, measures to avoid green gentrification.</p>
