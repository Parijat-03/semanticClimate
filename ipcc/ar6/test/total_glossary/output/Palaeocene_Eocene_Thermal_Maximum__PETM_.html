<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The PETM is a transient event that occurred between 55.9 and 55.7 million years ago. Continental positions at this time were somewhat different to present due to tectonic plate movements. Geological data indicate that the PETM was characterised by a warming (<em>global mean surface temperature</em> rose to about 4Â°Câ7 Â°C warmer than the preceding mean state), and an increase in atmospheric CO2 (from about 900 to about 2000 ppmv). In addition, ocean <em>pH</em> and oxygen content decreased; many deep-sea species went extinct and tropical <em>coral reefs</em> diminished.</p>
