Abstract</div> <p id="Par3">This chapter notes the efforts of implementing a climate change curriculum within the Harvard Graduate School of Education that helps to build competencies for potential leaders in different education sectors so that they can collaboratively combat climate change. Literature points out the fruitful and productive partnerships of grassroots initiatives with large scale institutions and/or government organizations. The authors explore the conception of a climate change curriculum with explicit content knowledge and thoughtful pedagogy, designed by students and supported by faculty. The authors examine the design elements of the curriculum and then specify the implementation process of a curriculum at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). The authors draw out the limitations and implications of "students as partners" in the co-creation of learning and teaching in the field of sustainable development education within higher education institutions.</p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="issue-copyright-statement" value="© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021" /> <meta name="issue license" value="Open Access This book is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made.

Beyond the Bottom-Up and Top-Down Debate on Climate Change Education</div> <p id="Par4">Climate is a dynamic interplay of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere (Aspen Global Change Institute <a href="#CR2">2019</a>). Whereas weather is defined by fickle fluctuations from day to day, climate change is a long term, sustained trend of change in climate. As rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions continue to trap heat in the form of infrared radiation (Fahey <a href="#CR16">2012</a>), global warming has been occurring at rates much faster than anticipated and its effects being clearly felt worldwide.</p> <p id="Par5">Despite alarming amount of evidence from the scientific community, global warming remains an issue of political debate in the United States, accentuating the ideological phenomenon categorized as ‘climate change denial (Hess and Collins <a href="#CR29">2018</a>).’ The withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement Treaties (Pompeo <a href="#CR45">2019</a>) and the reversal of numerous environmental rules and regulations (Clements et al. <a href="#CR6">2020</a>) indicate that American politics may stand in the way of achieving an environmentally sustainable future. Consequently, local and regional actors in the US are increasingly stepping forward to fill the policy void created by federal inaction (Reeves et al. <a href="#CR48">2014</a>). Inciting and mobilizing citizen action could be central in mitigating the effects of climate change (Wi <a href="#CR68">2019</a>).</p> <p id="Par6">If students are educated to understand and act upon changes in climate, they can create a grassroots movement that produces systemic changes. A grassroots movement refers to an initiative to help individuals engage in community interventions and activities with the mission of instrumenting local and societal change for the collective interest of the community (de Souza <a href="#CR9">2007</a>; Fisher <a href="#CR18">1998</a>; Rothman <a href="#CR53">1996</a>). Grassroots organizations have shown promising results in raising awareness and encouraging community involvement (Christens <a href="#CR5">2010</a>; People’s Association [PA] <a href="#CR44">2011</a>; Paul and Tan <a href="#CR43">2003</a>; Smith <a href="#CR57">2000</a>), but the debate over top-down versus bottom-up approaches in climate change education (CCE) has long persisted (Fadeeva et al. <a href="#CR15">2014</a>). </p> <p id="Par7">In essence, the main aim of climate change education (CCE), which is rooted in education for sustainable development (ESD) (UNESCO <a href="#CR63">2015</a>), is to engage different stakeholders in promoting lifelong education for global citizenship and help build a knowledge society in which local communities act upon recommendations. Educating for this type of change is a challenge in traditional western education because education is no longer considered a top-down transmission of knowledge, information, and values (Varga et al. <a href="#CR65">2007</a>). Rather, a bottom-up approach promotes creativity and ownership of joint involvement and action, allowing for a leveraging of specialized knowledge and experiences contributed by citizens (Fraser et al. <a href="#CR21">2006</a>; Wi <a href="#CR68">2019</a>). However, there are some advantages to a top-down educational approach. According to Wi (<a href="#CR68">2019</a>), its simplicity and efficiency in decision making as well as its ability to mobilize more resources and generate widespread awareness can help get things done. Ultimately, Wi argues for a collaboration and infusion of both approaches as key to a successful implementation of CCE.</p> <p id="Par9">Literature additionally points out the potentially fruitful and productive partnerships of grassroots initiatives with large scale institutions and/or government organizations. Reeves et al. (<a href="#CR48">2014</a>) suggests governments should set up grassroots initiatives themselves ‘from the outside’ to generate climate change activism among citizens. Within higher education institutions, Fadeeva et al. (<a href="#CR15">2014</a>) talks about the need to move beyond the top-down versus bottom-up participation and embrace a participatory democracy in which everyone is involved and held responsible. Brundiers et al. (<a href="#CR4">2014</a>, p. 196) comment that to move beyond the inertia of academic institutions and break established patterns requires an innovative, multilateral relationship<s>s</s> between faculty, students, and surrounding communities.</p> <p id="Par10">In this chapter, we explore the question acutely posed by Van der Leeuw et al.</p> <p id="Par11"> </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par12">Academic institutions remain so inertial because the professoriate remains in familiar and comfortable patterns. This is human nature but denudes the academy of the energy and passion needed for change. A more bilateral relationship between faculty and students might produce different outcomes. <i>If students played an equal role in the development of curricula, selection of course content, and initiation of applied projects, how different might the impact of the academy become?</i> (Van der Leeuw et al. <a href="#CR64">2012</a>, p. 118)<i>.</i></p> </div> <p /> <p id="Par13">We begin by examining the necessary design elements of embedding CCE within schools of education and then articulate the implementation process of a CCE curriculum at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). Last, we discuss the limitations and implications of "students as partners" in the co-creation of learning and teaching in higher education institutions and in the field of sustainable development education.</p> </div> <div class="whattoconsiderwhenintegratingclimatechangeeducation(cce)withinschoolsofeducation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
What to Consider When Integrating Climate Change Education (CCE) Within Schools of Education</div> <p id="Par14">Previous efforts to embed CCE within education systems have been centered around teacher education (Vega-Marcote and Varela-Losada <a href="#CR66">2016</a>; Hopkins and McKeown <a href="#CR31">2014</a>; Varga et al. <a href="#CR65">2007</a>) or a school-based implementation of a whole school approach (UNESCO <a href="#CR62">2014</a>). However, neither teachers nor schools are the only constituents of education. Multiple key stakeholders in education such as educational policy makers, researchers, teacher certification boards, teacher education institution executives, administrative staff, and students must all work together in the reorientation towards sustainability. Ferreira et al. (<a href="#CR17">2007</a>) call this a "Whole-of System Model," in which all elements of the system are engaged in the process of embedding a new curriculum, new policy, or whatever is (collectively) determined to be most needed within the particular contexts.</p> <p id="Par15">The difficulty of serving the whole of the education system (Vega-Marcote and Varela-Losada <a href="#CR66">2016</a>) has long been cited as an existing tension plaguing the current environmental and sustainability education efforts in pre-service and in-service teacher education. Graduate schools of education are hubs that attract pre-professionals and professionals from various roles in education. A CCE curriculum that facilitates the collaboration of pre-professionals and professionals across the education sector would promote peer-learning and collaboration, infusing the diversity of perspectives and modeling a whole-of systems approach.</p> <p id="Par16">To note, the desire for a curriculum like ours arose not because we wanted to discourage or diminish the existence of CCE curriculum already blended implicitly within several existing structures in schools of education (Denby and Rickards <a href="#CR10">2016</a>; Molthan-Hill et al. <a href="#CR39">2019</a>), but to draw out an explicit curricular experience of CCE and model a new multi-lateral approach among students at schools of education. Too often, when students engage in classes in which elements of sustainable development (SD) are implicit within the content or pedagogy of the class (Denby and Rickards <a href="#CR10">2016</a>), key competencies in sustainable development (SD) are passed down in an ‘unconscious’ or ‘unofficial’ way, making the transition from knowledge into action difficult (Lambrechts et al. <a href="#CR34">2013</a>).</p> <p id="Par17">What emerged was the idea to create a curriculum with the blend of explicit content knowledge and purposeful pedagogical structure that was partially student led but faculty supported. A successful implementation of a curriculum within one school of education could generate momentum for other schools of education to follow suit.</p> <p id="Par18">In order to follow a comprehensive approach to integrate much of what is known about how educational institutions change to become more relevant, we examined the conception of a student led curriculum through a framework that analyzes the process of educational change to advance global education through five perspectives: cultural, psychological, professional, institutional, and political (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>).</p> <div class="aculturalperspectiveofastudentledcurriculumofclimatechange" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
A Cultural Perspective of a Student Led Curriculum of Climate Change</div> <p id="Par19">A cultural perspective emphasizes that educational practice is the result of shared norms, artifacts and practices which define how education is broadly understood in a society (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>). Researchers have found that most people who recycle do not do so out of concern for the environment; they do it because it is socially encouraged – a sociocultural norm (Schultz <a href="#CR54">2002</a>).</p> <p id="Par20">Climate change involves global problems that require social, technological, and political relations to be successful (Räthzel and Uzzell <a href="#CR47">2009</a>; Wi <a href="#CR68">2019</a>). CCE also hinges upon a shared vision defined by innovative, multilateral relationships among faculty, students, and surrounding communities (Brundiers et al. <a href="#CR4">2014</a>). Establishing a shared sense of environmental responsibility is a critical cultural norm, serving as the foundation for numerous sustainability initiatives.</p> <p id="Par21">Another way to introduce an inclusive culture of sustainability is to land on a shared meaning of terminology. CCE is inundated with terminologies that are similar in nuance but different in meaning (Varga et al. <a href="#CR65">2007</a>) which can be intimidating and confusing. Moreover, global standards and guidelines on a common CCE have yet to be implemented.</p> </div> <div class="apsychologicalperspectiveofastudentledcurriculumofclimatechange" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
A Psychological Perspective of a Student Led Curriculum of Climate Change</div> <p id="Par22">Next, a psychological perspective highlights the implications of knowledge about how people learn for the process of changing teaching and learning for students, teachers and others supporting instruction (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>). This means that education programs need to be purposefully designed, with specific behavioral changes targeted from the outset. It is not enough for students to acquire theoretical concepts but also to be prepared to act, based on sensible decisions for real-world and complex situations (Vega-Marcote and Varela-Losada <a href="#CR66">2016</a>). This implies that the educational actions should seek the development of specific skills that foster sustainable actions. Wiek et al. (<a href="#CR70">2011</a>) illustrates five basic competencies of education for sustainable development (ESD) that should be combined to reach this aim: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par23"><b>Systems-thinking competence:</b> the ability to collectively analyze complex systems across different domains (society, environment, economy, etc.) and across different scales (local to global), thereby considering cascading effects, inertia, feedback loops and other systemic features related to sustainability issues and problem-solving frameworks.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par24"><b>Anticipatory competence:</b> the ability to collectively analyze, evaluate, and craft rich visions of the future related to sustainability issues and problem-solving frameworks.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par25"><b>Normative competence</b>: the ability to collectively map, specify, apply, reconcile, and negotiate sustainability values, principles, goals, and targets.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par26"><b>Strategic competence:</b> the ability to collectively design and implement interventions, transitions, and transformative governance strategies toward sustainability.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par27"><b>Interpersonal competence:</b> the ability to motivate, enable, and facilitate collaborative participatory sustainability research and problem solving.</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par28">Moreover, best practices in education and effective pedagogies must be infused throughout the design of a competency-driven curriculum. We provide a prototype of a competency driven curriculum embedded with the best practices of twenty-first century learning in section <a href="#Sec6">6.3</a> (stage 5) and in the <a href="#Sec13">Appendix B</a>.</p> <p id="Par29">Finally, climate apathy is real and students themselves often do not feel the need to learn or take a course on climate change. Psychologists Kasser and Ryan (<a href="#CR33">1996</a>) define four types of motivation<s>s</s> propelling individuals towards a goal. Extrinsic motivation as well as intrinsic ones can incite motivation among students. To incite intrinsic motivation and a connection to nature, Hungerford and Volk (<a href="#CR32">1990</a>) introduce the importance of fostering a personal connection to nature and taking ownership of a problem. Extrinsic motivation can be cultivated when elements of CCE are seen to translate into very practical elements in the workforce. In 2017, the sustainability sector saw a substantial increase in employment as well as average wages $5000 above the national median (Environmental Defense Fund and Meister Consultants Group <a href="#CR14">2017</a>).</p> </div> <div class="aprofessionalperspectiveofastudentledcurriculumofclimatechange" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
A Professional Perspective of a Student Led Curriculum of Climate Change</div> <p id="Par30">The professional perspective goes beyond teacher pedagogy and focuses on the structure of roles and institutions in integrating expert knowledge into practice (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>). Teachers are an essential pillar in CCE, for they are directly responsible for the teaching and learning process. There is plenty of literature on the impact of teacher-student relationships in the classroom (Forbes and Zint <a href="#CR20">2010</a>; Roorda et al. <a href="#CR52">2011</a>; García Bacete et al. <a href="#CR22">2014</a>), as well as the importance of teachers as role models for the development of environmental literacy (Rickinson <a href="#CR51">2001</a>; Stern et al. <a href="#CR59">2010</a>).</p> <p id="Par31">Beyond providing relational teaching, instructors play a pivotal role as knowledge building catalysts. To aid in these efforts, instructors can carefully consider the selection of resources made available at higher education institutions that promote professional development initiatives. Instructors often have access to an abundance of institutional resources related to climate change, as universities are often the hub of innovative research and cutting-edge technology (Dyer and Andrews <a href="#CR12">2011</a>).</p> <p id="Par32">Furthermore, there has been rising interest in research and practice about ‘students as partners’ through co-created learning and teaching (Cook-Sather et al. <a href="#CR8">2014</a>; Dunne <a href="#CR11">2016</a>; Mercer-Mapstone et al. <a href="#CR38">2017</a>). This bilateral relationship often results in greater learning outcomes and skill enhancements for students.</p> </div> <div class="aninstitutionalperspectiveofastudentledcurriculumofclimatechange" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
An Institutional Perspective of a Student Led Curriculum of Climate Change</div> <p id="Par33">An institutional perspective focuses on the educational structures, norms, regulations, and organizational design (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>), exploring the work of teaching and learning through a systemic lens. Numerous challenges and internal/external pressures exist for schools of education to bring forth change on a systemic level.</p> <p id="Par34">While CCE is important to all education levels, from primary schools to universities ( Harker-Schuch <a href="#CR71">2019</a>), higher education marks itself distinct in its role in deepening knowledge (Radaković et al. <a href="#CR46">2017</a>; Vettori and Rammel <a href="#CR67">2014</a>), inspiring scientifically rigorous expertise (Anderson <a href="#CR1">2012</a>), and teaching the skills of integration, synthesis, and systems-thinking to cope with complex problems in confronting sustainability challenges (Stephens et al. <a href="#CR58">2008</a>).</p> <p id="Par35">As institutions, schools of education should understand their role in translating cutting-edge research and best practices in education into information that policymakers can apply (Dyer and Andrews <a href="#CR12">2011</a>). Furthermore, institutions should provide support to grassroots initiatives in SD, for without its support, innovations are short-lived and unable to last beyond personnel and changes within (Hopkins and McKeown <a href="#CR31">2014</a>).</p> </div> <div class="apoliticalperspectiveofastudentledcurriculumofclimatechange" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
A Political Perspective of a Student Led Curriculum of Climate Change</div> <p id="Par36">A political perspective recognizes that education affects the various interests of many different groups that are often in conflict with one another (Reimers <a href="#CR50">2020</a>). The role of universities is especially important in areas of the world where strongly opinionated leaders and media outlets have created confusion among the public about environmental issues like climate change. The topic of climate change resonates with deeply held values, such that adults respond by protecting their group identity and ways of life (Monroe et al. <a href="#CR40">2017</a>).</p> <p id="Par37">In the United States, there is a considerable difference between the probability of taking at least one climate-change related course at public research universities with Democrat-controlled state legislatures versus Republican or split-controlled state legislatures (Hess and Collins <a href="#CR29">2018</a>). The effects of politics trickle down into teacher and student readiness and belief in teaching and learning about climate change. Stevenson et al. (<a href="#CR60">2016</a>) note that a teacher’s belief that global warming is happening appears to predict a student’s belief.</p> <p id="Par38">Despite political challenges, higher education institutions can and must continue to provide an important source of countervailing institutional power to misinformation and lack of policy support when it comes to climate change.</p> </div> </div> <div class="acasestudy:implementationsofastudentledcurriculumattheharvardgraduateschoolofeducation(hgse)" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
A Case Study: Implementations of a Student Led Curriculum at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE)</div> <p id="Par39">There were three main reasons to use Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) as a pilot school to test the concept of a student led curriculum. </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par40">First, at the time of writing we had been graduate students at HGSE, allowing us easier access to the resources, staff, and administration needed to design a student driven curriculum within a higher-ed institution.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par41">Second, the intent of our curriculum and our efforts to scale aligned with the sustainability mission of the university.

It became evident that our curriculum would also need sustainable support from the institution.</p> <p id="Par61">We approached a professor at HGSE, a cognitive scientist whose work centers around ecology, climate change, and the use of virtual and augmented reality in the classroom. In particular, her research identifies ways in which understandings about the nature of causality impact our ability to deal with complexity in our world. Her extensive expertise and experience on the topic made her our top candidate as we approached her with the idea of implementing a climate change curriculum at HGSE.</p> <p id="Par62">This exchange indicated that for a curriculum to be introduced at HGSE, we would have to identify and demonstrate the need for a course on climate change. If and only then, faculty could move forward with the motion, and the course would be examined for approval. To aid that process, we administered a needs assessment to demonstrate the existing gaps between current course offerings and student demand for the intended curriculum.

A randomized sample was collected through an online survey soliciting students within HGSE and the greater Harvard community. Limitations of the survey include probable bias towards climate activism due to its opt-in design, as well as its small sample size, representing less than 10% of the overall HGSE student population. The 66 participants were affiliated with various programs at HGSE and planned to go into different sectors in education, reflecting the diverse student composition in education sectors that our curriculum targets.

Numerous studies have highlighted the benefits of active, project-based learning (Leigh <a href="#CR35">2009</a>). The semester-long project involves a group of 3–5 students (Henke <a href="#CR28">1985</a>) with varying levels of experience in multiple education sectors, collaborating to craft a holistic educational strategy to mitigate climate change. Students are asked to formulate project groups around a jurisdiction with meaningful personal ties, helping to contextualize learning as local, tangible, and personally relevant (Cone et al. <a href="#CR7">2012</a>; Anderson <a href="#CR1">2012</a>). Each jurisdiction will highlight the different agenda and perspectives present today in the twenty-first century global climate change movement. Students will give presentations in the final week and submit a 20-page-paper as a final project. Throughout the project, students are active participants in their own learning which will include the design of their experiences and the realization of their learning outcomes. Ultimately, students can take full ownership of their own learning. This class will involve weekly group assignments (Monroe et al. <a href="#CR40">2017</a>) that students will start in the class but finish as collaborative homework.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">e.</span><p id="Par043">Situated</p> <p id="Par91">The second half of the week additionally focuses on student-centered activities, guest lecturers, simulations, and excursions to provide a thought-provoking experience for students to experience real life perspectives in the topic of climate change.

Implications &amp;amp; Conclusion</div> <p id="Par96">Our chapter described and analyzed efforts of implementing a climate change curriculum within the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) that helps to build competencies for potential leaders in different education sectors so that they can combat climate change collaboratively. However, our goal is not the development and implementation of a single curriculum. We aspire to achieve a collective legacy of preparing educators within the whole-of-system and achieve widespread change, which will require concentrated and concerted effort<s>s</s> to disseminate the importance of climate change curricula at multiple schools of education.</p> <p id="Par97">There are obvious limitations in focusing solely on a curriculum without simultaneous efforts to promote sustainability as endorsed within a whole-school model of ESD within the entire Harvard Graduate School of Education. Moreover, the disruption of Covid-19 may have significant, damaging effects to the immediate implementation of the curriculum, as well as its aftermaths in the upcoming years should there be a shift to a digital model of education. Furthermore, the institution shift into a mode to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the school may induce several entanglements previously unanticipated in the conception of the curriculum.</p> <p id="Par98">To answer our original question: If students played an equal role in the development of curricula, selection of course content, and initiation of applied projects, how different might the impact of the academy become?</p> <p id="Par99">Our curriculum explored the successful beginnings of a student/faculty co-creation and collaboration. This is not to say there were not tensions between expert and novice and between discovery and direction. For a successful blend of bottom-up and top-down interaction, multiple components must come together under mutual respect, common understanding, and shared responsibility. Learner agency, increased satisfaction with the academy, and heightened engagement came with the author’s participation of a curriculum design. The institution was provided with insights into students’ perspective and needs as well as enhanced capacity to promote a holistic engagement with learners.</p> <p id="Par100">Ultimately, a whole-of-systems approach to climate change means that the entirety of the system promotes action for reducing climate change, sharing the responsibility within all. While each individual component of these five perspectives is integral to creating a culture of change, it is the sum of the respective perspectives and the interaction between all of the elements that will be critical in the 21st global movement of shared environmental responsibility. And a curriculum like ours, educating future leaders within schools of education, is a step closer in the right direction of attaining a sustainable future for all.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="app-group" title="app-group"> <div class="app" title="app"> <div class="appendices" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
