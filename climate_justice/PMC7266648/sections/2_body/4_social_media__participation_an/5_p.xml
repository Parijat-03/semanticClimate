Thus, efficacy is obtained in these surveillance regimes. Significantly, this is achieved not through the type of agency commonly associated with democratic participation, rather a negative agency, surrendering to the panoptic view in recognition of its capacity to service the individual within very narrow and uncontested spheres. This exchange has a psychic cost. Hoffmann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>) identified &#8220;privacy cynicism&#8221; as the tendency for users to engage in &#8220;a cognitive coping mechanism, allowing users to rationalise taking advantage of online services despite serious privacy concerns.&#8221;</p>
