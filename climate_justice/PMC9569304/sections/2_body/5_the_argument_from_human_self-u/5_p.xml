Recall that the Moral Equivalence Thesis entails that we must see procreation and overconsumption as morally equivalent in the area of distributive justice. If procreation is part of how we understand ourselves as human beings, whereas overconsumption is not, then the Moral Equivalence Thesis breaks down. The real freedom to procreate contributes to human beings seeing themselves as human beings, and hence the denial of this freedom is dehumanizing. In contrast, there is nothing dehumanizing about being denied access to overconsumption. We may argue that human beings who are living in devastating poverty are dehumanized, but this doesn&#8217;t undermine the argument, since the Moral Equivalence Thesis focuses on the alleged equivalence between procreation and overconsumption, not on the consumption needed to meet our basic needs.</p>
