This is in addition to crop varieties suited to the changing climate. These measures, if implemented as part of a well-defined urban planning strategy may help adapt to the aforementioned impacts of climate change. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="164.54" top="680.91"><span x0="72.02" y0="680.91" x1="164.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 680.91; y1: 692.91; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(ii) Infrastructure</span><span x0="164.54" y0="680.91" x1="526.33" style="x0: 164.54; x1: 167.88; y0: 680.91; y1: 692.91; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: To keep up growing pace of GDP growth as mentioned in the eleventh five-year plan and to cope with the rate of population increase, studies estimate that investments in physical infrastructure are slated to grow at 20 percent per annum. In 2011-12 there were INR 6 trillion spent on infrastructure development. The most critical infrastructure include telecommunications, electric power, gas and oil storage and transportation, water supply, banking and financial services, emergency-service institutions, including hospitals, police stations, fire &amp; rescue departments and government institutions (Planning Commission Working Group on Infrastructure, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="127.7" top="541.92"><span x0="72.02" y0="541.92" x1="127.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 541.92; y1: 553.92; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure: </span><span x0="127.22" y0="541.92" x1="526.17" style="x0: 127.22; x1: 135.88; y0: 541.92; y1: 553.92; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">A large majority of infrastructure is in urban areas where majority of the population resides. Delhi has one of the highest per capita expenditure on infrastructure of all states in India, with INR 700 billion being spent for preparations for commonwealth games alone (GNCTD). The annual plan outlay for 2012-13 in Delhi was about INR 150 billion (Delhi Budget, 2013). A large chunk (22%) of this money was spent on physical infrastructure like transportation. This physical infrastructure may be susceptible to increased wear tear from high intensity rainfall that may reduce the lifetime of infrastructure (Mellilo, et al., 2010).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="418.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="418.78" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 418.78; y1: 430.78; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="133.1" y0="418.78" x1="526.15" style="x0: 133.1; x1: 141.76; y0: 418.78; y1: 430.78; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Damage to infrastructure will affect Delhi as a whole, as it would serve to slow the rate of economic and social growth. The transport sector would be particularly impacted as most of the investments in physical infrastructure are in this sector. Roads and bridges being constructed as part of the development plan of Delhi may be susceptible to increased intensity of rainfall (CICERO, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="176.54" top="327.46"><span x0="72.02" y0="327.46" x1="176.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 327.46; y1: 339.46; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity: </span><span x0="178.58" y0="327.46" x1="526.1" style="x0: 178.58; x1: 185.91; y0: 327.46; y1: 339.46; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The government is incentivizing the construction of green buildings, which encourages resource efficiency, and the use of locally sourced materials (GNCTD, 2012). There are however, no guidelines implemented to ensure long term resilience to impacts of climate on buildings. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.41" top="251.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="251.95" x1="526.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 251.95; y1: 263.95; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Changing climate patterns would serve to reduce lifespan of existing infrastructure and delay the growth of incremental infrastructure. Old infrastructure and infrastructure dependent on external raw materials would be disproportionately affected by these impacts. The rate of infrastructure development may be slowed down due to rising prices of materials involved in construction of these infrastructure services (Mellilo, et al., 2010). More widespread implementation of sustainable supply chain practices and construction of climate resilient infrastructure would help adapt to these impacts of climate change. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="219.95" top="128.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="128.95" x1="219.95" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 128.95; y1: 140.95; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(iii)Solid Waste Management</span><span x0="220.01" y0="128.95" x1="526.25" style="x0: 220.01; x1: 226.01; y0: 128.95; y1: 140.95; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">&#8211; 69 million tons of solid waste is generated every year in Indian cities. In most cities across India infrastructure available for SWM is lacking, leading to problems like increased spread of diseases, deterioration of water quality and reduction in aesthetic quality of the cities.  </span></div></body></html>
