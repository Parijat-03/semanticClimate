In particular, our counterfactual analysis suggests that Africa, already the most food insecure region, has been hardest hit with regards to the impact of climate change on food insecurity. Our analysis suggests that, between 2014 and 2019, severe food insecurity is 0.88 percentage-points higher, and moderate to severe food security 2.24 percentage-points higher, due to climate change. These results do not surprise us, African countries have long been identified as being particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
