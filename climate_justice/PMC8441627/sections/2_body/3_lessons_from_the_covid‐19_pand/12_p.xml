<p>Some good news is that human&#8208;created systems are at the root of most of our problems, systems that can be changed by humans. These systems act in unseen and insidious ways, but Jung&#8217;s and Hillman&#8217;s emphasis on the power of personification is a god&#8208;send. Jung said the modern&#8208;day monsters and dragons &#8211; repeat, <italic toggle="yes">monsters and dragons</italic> &#8211; were big things: big machines, big militaries, big governments, but his particular example is most poignant. &#8216;All the little merchants &#8230; crushed by the Standard Oil Trust&#8217;, he said, must have felt it to be &#8216;a great crushing monster&#8217; (Jung&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1928</xref>&#8208;30, pp. 538&#8208;39). We have the ultimate development of that with the modern giant corporations that rule the planet. A corporation is interested only in making a profit for its shareholders, assessed on a quarterly basis. It tries to eliminate competition, people are expendable, and the environment is treated as a resource&#8208;base and a waste&#8208;dump. In other words, our planet is in the grips of the ultimate narcissistic dragons and monsters &#8211; the corporations.</p>
