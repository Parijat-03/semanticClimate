The chapter starts with an assessment of the historical and projected responses of land processes to climate change and extremes (Section 2.2). Subsequently, the chapter assesses historical and future changes in terrestrial GHG &#64258;uxes (Section 2.3) as well as non-GHG &#64258;uxes and precursors of SLCFs (Section 2.4). Section&#160;2.5 focuses on how historical and future changes in land use and land cover in&#64258;uence climate change/variability through biophysical and biogeochemical forcing and feedbacks, how speci&#64257;c land management affects climate, and how, in turn, climate-induced land changes feed back to climate. Section 2.6 assesses the consequences of land-based adaptation and mitigation options for the climate system in GHG and non-GHG exchanges. Sections 2.3 and 2.6 address implications of the Paris Agreement for land&#8211;climate interactions, and the scienti&#64257;c evidence base for ongoing negotiations around the Paris rulebook, the global stocktake and credibility in measuring, reporting and verifying the climate impacts of anthropogenic activities on land. This chapter also examines how land use and management practices may affect climate change through biophysical feedbacks and radiative forcing (Section 2.5), and assesses policy-relevant projected land use changes and sustainable land management for mitigation and adaptation (Section 2.6). Finally, the chapter concludes with a&#160;brief assessment of advances in the understanding of the ecological and biogeochemical processes underlying land&#8211;climate interactions&#160;(Section 2.7).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="147.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 147.57; y1: 157.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="147.57" x1="566.11">The chapter includes three chapter boxes providing general overview of (i) processes underlying land&#8211;climate interactions (Box 2.1), (ii)&#160;methodological approaches for estimating anthropogenic land carbon &#64258;uxes from national to global scales (Box 2.2), and (iii) CO</span><span style="x0: 560.62; x1: 563.81; y0: 110.21; y1: 116.86; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="560.62" y0="110.21" x1="565.41">2 </span><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.69; y0: 99.52; y1: 109.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="99.52" x1="566.07">fertilisation and enhanced terrestrial uptake of carbon (Box 2.3).
