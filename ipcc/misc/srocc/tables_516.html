      <td>Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1 | There is a need to balance increasing demands for food, fuel and fibre with long-term sustainability\nof land use. Sustainable intensification can, in theory, offer a window of opportunity for the intensification of land use without causing degradation. This\npotentially allows the sparing of land to provide other ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and the protection of biodiversity. However, the\npotential for SI is system specific and may change through time (indicated by grey arrows). Current practice may already be outside of this window and be\nunsustainable in terms of negative impacts on the long-term sustainability of the system.</td>
