These activists view unions as just another vehicle for social justice and organizing for labor rights, human rights, civil rights, immigrant rights and climate justice as interrelated. Organizers may move between organizations with related objectives, or hold dual positions.

Another example is Jess Morales Rocketto who serves with the National Domestic Workers Alliance, while co-chairing the Families Belong Together Coalition which works &#8220;to end family separation and detention,&#8221; after also serving with the AFL-CIO and in several political campaigns (National Domestic Workers Alliance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p>
