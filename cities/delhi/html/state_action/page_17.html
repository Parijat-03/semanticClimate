Mother earth provides us with all our needs. But in our desire to get most out of it, we have neglected its health and as per the report of the United Nations Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, planet earth needs urgent resuscitation to continue to provide for our needs. Department of Environment, Government of NCT of Delhi is the State Nodal Agency for the coordination and preparation of SAPCC. The Sectoral Working Groups with officers of concerned departments dealing with the sectors sensitive to climate change were constituted. In addition to the experts from the concerned department, the working groups had participation of experts from the various concerned departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi, Science and Technology, academia, research, NGOs and Civil Societies etc. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.95" top="543.81"><span x0="72.02" y0="543.81" x1="507.95" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 543.81; y1: 554.85; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The policy prescriptions given in the document need to be adopted and implemented as part of our development goals. It will mean a new thinking to be infused in our planning processes and harnessing new technologies as well as making innovative programs, which can meet the objectives set forth by us. It seeks to redefine the growth imperatives for mankind, by ensuring sustainability of planet earth's bio diversity and natural balance, as part of the development process. Unless each one can put the effort and be concerned about it, and contribute to achieve this, there can be irretrievable damage to mother earth. Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC consists of following key chapters: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Profile, Energy Consumption Profile, Energy and Power, Transportation, Urban Planning, Forest -and Biodiversity, Health, Agricultrure and Horticulture, Vulnerability Assessment, Water, Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation System and Implementation of the Plan.

The time to act is now. Each of us as citizens, planners, policy makers, administrators, business people, and students can enhance our ability to contribute to a more to prevent worsening of our environment. I appreciate the efforts of various state departments and professionals associated with Climate Change for their commendable work.  </span></div></body></html>
