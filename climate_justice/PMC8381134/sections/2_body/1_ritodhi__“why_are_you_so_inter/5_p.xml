<italic>We are scientists, we deal with facts. People in the village don&#8217;t understand all this. Especially young people. They just want to leave the mountains for the plains. Paharis don&#8217;t have access to a good education and are very superstitious. This is what is holding our region back. What we need is more investment in science and technology so that we can dispel these old stories. We have so many problems with floods, crop production, disasters, wild animals, diseases, etc. and we need to deal with them scientifically&#8230; the world over scientists are calling for action on climate change, and we should not get left behind like we usually do in the Himalayas</italic>
