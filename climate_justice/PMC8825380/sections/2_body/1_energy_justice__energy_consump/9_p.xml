Energy justice is not limited to mitigation but includes concerns such as the environmental impacts of renewables, technological issues such as developing smart grids and off-grid energy technologies, and topics such as the relation between property rights and construction of renewables and development of novel technologies (see van der Graaf &amp; Sovacool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). Energy justice is not limited to distributive justice, but also include procedural justice, and recognition (Sovacool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Whether renewable energy sources can develop at a fast enough pace to provide a sufficient share of the global energy to enable a just transition is disputed (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). A premise here is that renewables will provide a modest share of the global energy mix, and consequently, lowering emissions will often entail lowering energy use. But we will also consider the development of renewables and increased energy efficiency as possibilities for maintaining high levels of energy use per capita. We aim to show that the CA supplemented with ceilings is a reasonable theory to be applied to energy justice and establishing criteria for dividing burdens and benefits of just transitions.</p>
