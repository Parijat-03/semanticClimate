The work focused on re-assessing the current state of the art as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. As a result, the passenger car limits of 60&#160;g/km in 2030 and 10&#160;g/km in 2050 ensure both a significant increase in the efficiency of conventional passenger cars and an increasing proportion of electric vehicles. From a macroeconomic perspective, study no. 2 used a general equilibrium model to examine various scenarios, each of which used different policy measures, such as CO<sub>2</sub> performance standard. The results indicate that new car purchases change the most over time in the &#8220;standard&#8221; scenario. In order to comply with the CO<sub>2</sub> limits, there are both substitution effects between the demand classes and drive types, and budget effects in relation to the absolute level of new vehicle purchases. Further research (no. 3) comparatively analysed several instruments towards impact parameters, i.e. effectiveness, uncertainty (for vehicle suppliers), need for knowledge for different agents, need for commitment, revenue generation, and protection of specific investments. Finally, a value chain upstream analysis has been carried out (no. 4), assessing the risks of supply disruptions associated with vanadium-based redox flow batteries for the German market, using the Holistic Risk Analysis and Modelling (HoRAM) method.</p>
