In both economies, policy frameworks respond to and incorporate notions of &#8216;climate justice&#8217;. As will be seen, the EU and China are developing climate policy under the influence of differing perspectives on climate justice. Nevertheless, in the area of finance, they are employing some similar tools to achieve their stated goals. This article focuses on the relationship between approaches to climate justice in policy frameworks of the EU and China and the emerging frameworks of &#8216;sustainable&#8217; or &#8216;green&#8217; finance on both sides.</p>
