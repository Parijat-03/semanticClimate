<p>In a provocative piece, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Maylea (2020)</xref> isolates a
number of key problems to which social work has to face up. These include historical
&#8216;stains&#8217; (p. 9) from social work&#8217;s paternalistic past and a failure to
meet &#8216;contemporary challenges&#8217; (p. 11), including climate change and justice,
racism and gender inequality. Maylea calls social work &#8216;paternalistic&#8217; due to its
historical involvement in racial oppression of First Nations people in Australia, New Zealand,
the USA and Canada, and perpetuation of exclusionary treatment of these communities. He argues
that &#8216;by staying very still and moving very slowly&#8217; (p. 11) social work has
failed to make a significant contribution to addressing contemporary challenges like climate
change and race and gender inequality. Maylea&#8217;s ideas have provoked a spirited response
in defence of social work (see <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Garrett, 2021</xref>), and we
seek to contest this framing as &#8216;failures&#8217; and recast them as future challenges
for the profession.</p>
