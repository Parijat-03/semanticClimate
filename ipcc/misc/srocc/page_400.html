LDN is also closely related to many Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in the areas of poverty, food security, environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources (UNCCD 2016b). The GEF is supporting countries to set LDN targets and implement their LDN plans through its land degradation focal area, which encourages application of integrated landscape approaches to managing land degradation (GEF 2018). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="627.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 627.54; y1: 637.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="627.54" x1="307.6">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, comprises 17&#160;SDGs. Goal 15 is of direct relevance to land degradation, with the objective to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat deserti&#64257;cation and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Target 15.3 speci&#64257;cally addresses LDN. Other goals that are relevant for land degradation include Goal 2&#160;(Zero hunger), Goal 3&#160;(Good health and well-being), Goal 7&#160;(Affordable and clean energy), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and Goal 12 (Responsible production and consumption). Sustainable management of land resources underpins the SDGs related to hunger, climate change and environment. Further goals of a&#160;cross-cutting nature include 1&#160;(No poverty), 6&#160;(Clean water and sanitation) and 13 (Climate action). It remains to be seen how these interconnections are dealt with in practice. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="435.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 67.09; y0: 435.56; y1: 445.06; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="435.56" x1="307.6">With a&#160;focus on biodiversity, IPBES published a&#160;comprehensive assessment of land degradation in 2018 (Montanarella et al. 2018).

Implications for local land use and food security have been raised as a&#160;concern and need to be assessed (Edstedt and Carton 2018; Olsson et al. 2014b). Many projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradations (not to be confused with the national REDD+ programmes in accordance with the UNFCCC Warsaw Framework) are being planned and implemented to primarily target countries with high forest cover and high deforestation rates. Some parameters of incentivising emissions reduction, quality of forest governance, conservation priorities, local rights and tenure frameworks, and sub-national project potential are being looked into, with often very mixed results (Newton et al. 2016; Gebara and Agrawal 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="123.6"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 123.6; y1: 133.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="123.6" x1="307.55">Besides international public initiatives, some actors in the private sector are increasingly aware of the negative environmental impacts of some global value chains producing food, &#64257;bre, and energy products (Lambin et al. 2018; van der Ven and Cashore 2018; van der Ven et al. 2018; Lyons-White and Knight 2018).

Such limits are dynamic and interact with social and institutional conditions (Barnett et al. 2015; Filho and Nalau 2018). Exceeding adaptation limits will trigger escalating losses or require undesirable transformational change, such as forced migration. The rate of change in relation to the rate of possible adaptation is crucial (Dow et al. 2013). How limits to adaptation are de&#64257;ned, and how they can be measured, is contextual and contested. Limits must be assessed in relation to the ultimate goals of adaptation, which is subject to diverse and differential values (Dow et al. 2013; Adger et al. 2009). A&#160;particularly sensitive issue is whether migration is accepted as adaptation or not (Black et al. 2011; Tacoli 2009; Bardsley and Hugo 2010). If migration were understood and accepted as a&#160;form of successful adaptation, it would change the limits to adaptation by reducing, or even avoiding, future humanitarian crises caused by climate extremes (Adger et al. 2009; Upadhyay et al. 2017; Nalau et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.06" top="399.55"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 399.55; y1: 409.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="399.55" x1="566.06">In the context of land degradation, potential limits to adaptation exist if land degradation becomes so severe and irreversible that livelihoods cannot be maintained, and if migration is either not acceptable or not possible. Examples are coastal erosion where land disappears (Gharbaoui and Blocher 2016; Luetz 2018), collapsing livelihoods due to thawing of permafrost (Landauer and Juhola 2019), and extreme forms of soil erosion, (e.g.,&#160;landslides (Van der Geest and Schindler 2016) and gully erosion leading to badlands (Poesen et al. 2003)).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="464.18" top="267.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 267.42; y1: 277.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="267.42" x1="464.18">1.8.6 Resilience and thresholds</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="243.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 243.52; y1: 253.02; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="243.52" x1="566.08">Resilience refers to the capacity of interconnected social, economic and ecological systems, such as farming systems, to absorb disturbance (e.g.,&#160;drought, con&#64258;ict, market collapse), and respond or reorganise, to maintain their essential function, identity and structure. Resilience can be described as &#8216;coping capacity&#8217;. The disturbance may be a&#160;shock&#160;&#8211; sudden events such as a&#160;&#64258;ood or disease epidemic&#160;&#8211; or it may be a&#160;trend that develops slowly, like a&#160;drought or market shift. The shocks and trends anticipated to occur due to climate change are expected to exacerbate risk of land degradation.
