<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This article provides a first conceptual step towards understanding LDPCs&#8217; needs in a coherent framework for policymaking, research, and global response under the PA. It appears to be a challenging task for the developed countries to meet LDPCs&#8217; needs as per their commitments under Articles 9, 10, and 11 of the PA. This article focuses on the needs of the least developed countries by analyzing their NDC submissions. In the next step, looking into the needs of developing countries can further contribute to the area of research. Hence, looking into the NDCs of the developed countries will further illuminate how far and to what level they are able to enable LDPCs and developing countries to implement their ambitious targets to meet the goal of the PA.</p>
