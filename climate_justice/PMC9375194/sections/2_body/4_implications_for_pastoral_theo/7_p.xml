For example, &#8220;[T]he predominantly non-White global south is being victimized by climate change more than the Whiter global north, even as the Whiter global north is contributing more to its acceleration&#8221; (Kendi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019a</xref>, p. 21). Applying the important metaphor put forward by Crenshaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1991</xref>), we can say that climate justice necessarily &#8220;intersects&#8221; with racial justice; there cannot be one without the other. Or, in the words of Elizabeth Yampierre, executive director of UPROSE, &#8220;It&#8217;s all related&#8221;:<disp-quote><p id="Par37">You can&#8217;t say that with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans the loss of lives was simply because there was an extreme weather event. The loss of life comes out of a legacy of neglect and racism. And that&#8217;s evident even in the rebuilding. It&#8217;s really interesting to see what happens to the land after people have been displaced, how land speculation and land grabs and investments are made in communities that, when there were black people living there, had endured not having the things people need to have livable good lives.
