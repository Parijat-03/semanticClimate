Even though Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth, meltwater 25 production over its ice shelves can be significant, leading to meltwater ponding. While it is more common in 26 summer, the intense winter surface melt can be driven by episodes of foehn winds on the leeside of the 27 mountains and by warm air intrusions from the ocean. Local snow accumulation is also influenced by 28 sublimation and snow transport. These variables have a direct impact on the total ice-sheet mass balance and 29 consequently on the ocean state (Chapter 9) and are tightly linked with the global climate (Chapter 10).  30 31 The total ice-sheet mass change is also strongly influenced by oceanic processes &#8211; changes in the total ice 32 sheet mass balance, sea ice and other key parameters and processes relevant to the Antarctic ice sheet are 33 discussed in Chapter 9 and the SROCC report (IPCC, 2019b). The Antarctic contribution to sea-level results 34 from the small imbalance between mass loss by ice discharge into the ocean and mass gain by net snow 35 accumulation, i.e. the surface mass balance. Overall the Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass and its 36 recent contribution to global mean sea-level rise has been estimated at 7.6 &#177; 3.9 mm between 1992 and 2017 37 corresponding to the loss of 2,720 &#177; 1,390 billion tonnes of ice (Chapter 9). 38 39 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 278.45; y1: 289.43; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="278.45" x1="254.97">Previous findings from IPCC assessments </span><span x0="27.66" y0="278.45" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 278.45; y1: 289.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">40 The following summary from previous IPCC reports is derived from the SROCC report (IPCC, 2019b) 41 unless otherwise stated.  42 43 Unlike the Arctic, the Antarctic ice sheet showed more variability in the surface air temperature changes 44 over the past 30 to 50 years.

More positive Southern 51 Annular Mode caused increased foehn winds and consequently increased surface melting on the Larsen ice 52 shelves. Strong warming between the mid-1950s and the late 1990s lead to the collapse of the Larsen B ice 53 shelf in 2002, which had been intact for the 11,000 years. 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
