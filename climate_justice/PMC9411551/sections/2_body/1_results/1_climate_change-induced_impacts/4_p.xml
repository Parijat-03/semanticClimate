In the higher scenario (38% of precipitation is attributable to climate change), 49.4% of the buildings that were flooded would have been flooded anyway, but 50.6% flooded only because of climate change; i.e., they would not have been flooded during the hurricane had there been no anthropogenic climate change to generate increased rainfall. Since Harris County is large, this corresponds to an estimated 53,616 parcels that would not have been flooded without climate change. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a map of areas that experienced flood impacts only because of climate change&#160;in the 38% scenario. For the lower &#8220;best estimate&#8221; (20%), the comparable figure is almost a third&#8212;i.e., 31.9% of the flooded houses would not have flooded without climate change. Even in the most conservative scenario we test&#8212;only 7% of the precipitation is associated with climate change&#8212;12.8% of the flooded residential buildings would not have flooded at all without climate change.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Map of climate change-attributed flooding (38% scenario).</title><p>Each hexagonal bin symbolizes the number of residential buildings that would not have flooded without the added impact of climate change in Harris County, Texas during Hurricane Harvey.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31056_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e421"/></fig></p>
