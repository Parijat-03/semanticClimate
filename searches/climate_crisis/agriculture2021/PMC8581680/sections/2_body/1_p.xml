The PHRC is a student-driven, metric-based initiative to inspire planetary health and sustainable healthcare education engagement in medical schools(<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Each participating school wrote and published school-specific individual reports alongside a larger comparative report on World Earth Day, the 22nd of April 2021. Alongside individual school reports, the comparative report was derived to help identify areas of strength and provide recommendations to all participants on improving engagement and education. This report was prepared by student teams with faculty input from sixty-two medical schools from across the USA, UK, Ireland and Canada, including QUB, and was supported by: Medical Students for a Sustainable Future; Planetary Health Alliance; Practice Greenhealth; Healthcare Without Harm; Students for Global Health; Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education; and Human Health &amp; Climate Change Club at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>
