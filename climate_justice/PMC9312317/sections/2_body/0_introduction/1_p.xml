While the former aims to prevent and reduce the impacts of climate change through measures like CO2 reductions, the latter considers how society should respond to actual or unavoidable climate impacts, such as flooding, drought, urban heat, and fires. As climate impacts become increasingly noticeable and locked-in across the world, adaptation has gained scholarly and political attention (Bassett and Fogelman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). Simultaneously, we see a swell in climate activism to demand that governments take stronger climate action, in particular through the recent efforts of the global Fridays For Future (FFF) campaign that followed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg&#8217;s famous school strike (de Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020b</xref>). However, these two observations have not yet been connected, thus overlooking to what extent mitigation and adaptation play a role in the demands of climate activists like those in FFF. Climate activism is typically assumed to be about mitigation (e.g. Brulle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Roser-Renouf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>), without investigating what role adaptation plays. The current paper addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing attitudes towards mitigation and adaptation in the Global Climate Strike organized by FFF in September 2019.</p>
