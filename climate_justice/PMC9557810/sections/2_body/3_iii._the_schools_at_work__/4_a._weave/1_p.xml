<disp-quote><p>On a sunny day, an architect and an Indigenous inhabitant of
<italic toggle="yes">Barrio Intercultural</italic> stand on an empty lot, holding
in their hands a model of one of the planned buildings in the
neighbourhood. As their hands move around the model, the light creates
shadows that get them to imagine together how the building might be used
at different times of the day and what that would mean for different
collective uses and members of the community.</p></disp-quote>
