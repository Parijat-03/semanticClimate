Yang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). On one hand, contact heterogeneity and movements of the host population play critical roles in facilitating disease transmission (Mbunge,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>); on the other hand, the outbreak severity might trigger some infection prevention behaviors of the host and induce the changes to their movements and daily activities (Weston et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, due to the risk attitudes and the NPIs, like social distancing and gathering restrictions, human daily activities and mobility have changed significantly worldwide (Chan et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Woods et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Particularly, several studies have suggested that the usage of public parks and open spaces were impacted by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemics and its NPI policies (Gelman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Shoari et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Volenec et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Xie et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
