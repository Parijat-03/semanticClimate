However, the country&#8217;s biocapacity declined rapidly in the studied period, while the ecological footprint largely followed a constant trend. Per person biocapacity and ecological footprint in Australia for the study period can be seen in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The biocapacity and ecological footprint per person in Australia over 1990&#8211;2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12053_2021_10014_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
