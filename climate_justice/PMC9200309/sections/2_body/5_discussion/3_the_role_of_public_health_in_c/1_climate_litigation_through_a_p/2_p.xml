(2018) found that the Clean Air Act (CAA) was used to support 32% of all cases in the US in which litigants relied on health concerns to support their claims [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Interviews with plaintiffs revealed that their primary incentive for pursuing cases under the CAA was that, unlike laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, the CAA has the protection of public health as its principle goal [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This shows that where health is the main focus of a given legal doctrine or environmental regulation, there exists a more direct and powerful avenue for individuals to pursue litigation on the basis of health concerns.</p>
