      <td>Migration is a key livelihood strategy across Asia and is driven by multiple factors such as socioeconomic changes, increasing climate\nvariability and disaster incidence, and changing aspirations. Displacement denotes a more involuntary movement in reaction to climatic\nor non-climatic factors. There is robust evidence, medium agreement that increased climate variability and extreme events are already\ndriving migration (Gemenne et al., 2015; Rigaud et al., 2018; IDMC, 2019; Jacobson et al., 2019; Siddiqui et al., 2019; IDMC, 2020;\nMaharjan et al., 2020) and medium evidence, medium agreement projecting that longer-term climate change will increase migration\nflows across Asia (Abubakar et al., 2018; Rigaud et al., 2018; Hauer et al., 2020; Bell et al., 2021).</td>

      <td>Detection and attribution: Does climate change drive migration? Ascertaining the role of climate change in migration is difficult\nand contested (see Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7 and RKR-H in Chapter 16), with observation-based studies either linking\nextreme event incidence, weather anomalies and environmental change with migration numbers or drivers (McLeman, 2014; Singh et al.,\n2019a; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020), and projection studies looking at particular risks such as SLR or drought by linking increasing\nwarming (often through representative concentration pathways, RCPs) and population growth. Despite methodological disagreement on\ndetection and attribution of migration due to climate change, there is medium confidence that higher warming and associated changes in\nfrequency and intensity of slow-onset events (such as drought and sea level rise) and rapid-onset events (such as cyclones and flooding)\nwill increase involuntary displacement in the future, especially under SSP3 and SSP4 pathways (Dasgupta et al., 2014a; Davis et al., 2018;\nRigaud et al., 2018; Hauer et al., 2020). But its role is smaller than non-climatic socio-economic drivers of migration (Wodon et al., 2014;\nAdger et al., 2021).</td>

      <td>Current migration and displacement. One in three migrants comes from Asia and the highest ratio of outward migrants is seen from\nhazard-exposed Pacific countries (Ober, 2019). In 2019, approximately 1900 disasters triggered 24.9 million new displacements across\n140 countries; in particular, Bangladesh, China, India and the Philippines each recorded more than 4 million disaster displacements (IDMC,\n2019). Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia see significant disaster-associated displacements: for example, heavy rain-induced flooding in\nKhatlon (Tajikistan) triggered 5400 new displacements; landslides in the Jalal-Abad (Kyrgyzstan) saw 4700 new displacements; and\nfloods in Altai, Tuva and Khakassia (Russia) displaced 1500 people. Iran reported the highest sub-regional figures with &gt;520,000 new\ndisaster-related displacements in 2019 (IDMC, 2019). In Southeast and East Asia, cyclones, floods and typhoons triggered internal\ndisplacement of 9.6 million people in 2019, almost 30% of total global displacements (IDMC, 2019). With most migrants in the region\nbeing temporary migrant workers, loss of jobs and wages among them have been particularly severe due to adverse economic climate\ntriggered by COVID-19 (ESCWA, 2020). It has also resulted in large-scale returns of migrant workers, and remittances have declined\ndrastically (Khanna, 2020; Li et al., 2021). Remittances to Eastern Europe and Central Asia are expected to decline 16.1% from 57 billion\nUSD in 2019 to 48 billion USD in 2020. Remittances in East Asia and the Pacific are estimated to fall 10.5% over the same period, from\n147 billion to 131 billion USD (United Nations, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on migrants (Rajan, 2020) in\nthe region, and some countries have targeted migrants in economic stimulus packages or income-support programmes; however, access\nto such support has been heterogeneous.</td>

      <td>Projected migration. Regional variation is significant across Asia. By one estimate, in South Asia, internal climate migrants (i.e., those\nmigrating due to climate change and associated impacts such as water scarcity, crop failure, SLR and storm surges) are projected to be\n40 million by 2050 (1.8% of regional population) under high warming (Rigaud et al., 2018). While methodological critiques remain on\nprojected migration estimates, what is certain is that some countries will be more affected that others; it is estimated that in southern\nBangladesh, SLR could displace 0.9&#8211;2.1 million people by direct inundation by 2050 (Jevrejeva et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2018). In South\nAsia, migration hotspots include the Gangetic Plain and the Delhi&#8211;Lahore corridor, and coastal cities such as Chennai, Chittagong, Dhaka\nand Mumbai, which will be simultaneously exposed to climate-change impacts, major migration destinations and amplified rural&#8211;urban\nmigration (Ober, 2019). Importantly, there is low agreement on projected numbers (see Boas et al., 2019) with uncertainties around how\nlocal policies and individual behaviours will shape migration choices. Even in high-risk places, people might choose to stay or be unable\nto move, resulting in &#8216;trapped&#8217; populations (Zickgraf, 2019; Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2020). There is currently inadequate evidence to ascertain\nthe nature and numbers of trapped populations currently or in the future.</td>

      <td>Implications of migration for adaptation. The evidence on migration and its impacts on adaptive capacity and risk reduction are\nmixed (Upadhyay, 2014; Banerjee et al., 2018; Szabo et al., 2018; Maharjan et al., 2020; Singh and Basu, 2020). Financial remittances help\nvulnerable households spread risk through better incomes, expanded networks and improved assets such as housing, education and\ncommunication technology (Jha et al., 2018; Szabo et al., 2018; Ober, 2019; Maharjan et al., 2020). Benefits from international remittances\nacross the Asia Pacific region were approximately 276 billion USD in 2017 (UN, 2018), and in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and\nNepal remittances were ~25% of the national GDP in 2015. However, migration requires a minimum level of resources, and liquidity\nconstraints impede internal migration by the poorest households often rendering them immobile (Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2020; Maharjan</td>
