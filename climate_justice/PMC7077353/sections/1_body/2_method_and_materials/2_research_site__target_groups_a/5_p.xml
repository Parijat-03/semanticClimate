This is in sharp contrast to Muslim women, particularly from the middle-income groups, who experience very little mobility and are not expected to work in the fields. Santal women work alongside men, and by themselves, in the fields on crops such as rice, wheat and maize. A middle-income Muslim woman commented, &#8220;Married Santal women have freedom to participate both in field and home. These women are participating at all levels of agricultural activities.&#8221; Cultural norms prohibit Bengali and Santal women from selling agricultural produce in local markets, though they sell vegetables, goats and cattle from the farm gate to middlemen. Although women can obtain credit from NGOs, this money is often turned over to men for their use.</p>
