<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most electricity is generated from a mix of renewable and fossil fuel sources. Institutions can switch to electricity suppliers that link directly to renewable energy generators (e.g., wind turbines), if available, or install their own renewable energy systems (e.g., solar panels and battery storage). Over time, gas heating systems can be replaced by electric systems that can be powered with renewable energy sources.</p>
