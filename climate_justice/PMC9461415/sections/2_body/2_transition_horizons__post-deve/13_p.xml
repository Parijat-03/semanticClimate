While instrumental narratives based on a fragmented and disenchanted worldview lead to the present scenario of uncertainties, plural narratives can contribute to re-enchantment, &#8220;suspending the sky&#8221; and &#8220;postponing the end of the world&#8221; (Krenak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). Consequently, shedding light on the <italic>pluriverse</italic> might inspire hope and expand horizons for regenerative possibilities toward desirable futures. Nature-based solutions to face climate change and biodiversity loss, thus, require narratives that transcend the disjunctive and reductionist thinking and binary splits between nature and culture, like <italic>Buen Vivir</italic>. From a systemic perspective, climate actions should result from a deep process of sociocultural transformations, presupposing the overcoming of the coloniality intrinsic to the materialist and accumulative logic (Quijano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2000</xref>).</p>
