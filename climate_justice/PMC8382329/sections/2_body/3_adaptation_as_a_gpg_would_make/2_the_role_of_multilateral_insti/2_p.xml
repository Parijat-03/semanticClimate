The GCF has the potential to play a stronger role in adaptation as the largest climate fund. Its Board already has decided to allocate half of the climate finance to both adaptation and mitigation, with an aim of delivering 50% of adaptation money to the PVCs. However, the GCF handles a quite small share of climate money. Still, this suggests a potential paradigm shift toward a transformative adaptation as a new norm. This shift calls for the increasing provision of funds for national public goods and GPGs, which reinforce one another.</p>
