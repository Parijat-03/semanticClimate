<disp-quote><p>Amidst laughter and the creation of an unfolding collective manifesto
towards a feminist city, Paola reflects on CISCSA&#8217;s feminist school:
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Something that we seek all the time in this work process is
to encourage ourselves to imagine other possible realities that we
always had on the horizon. We conduct several exercises to be able
to make room to imagine a feminist city in which we would like to
live [<xref rid="fig5-09562478221115334" ref-type="fig">Figure
5</xref>]. This means to give rise to the power of the feminist
imagination, to the possibility of imagining and dwelling cities
from other more beautiful, fairer, more habitable, more loving
places.&#8221;</italic><sup>(<xref rid="fn36-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">36</xref>)</sup></p></disp-quote>
