It says all the right things&#8212;talk about climate change, engage with your local politician, use your consumer power to buy renewable energy and sustainable goods, buy an electric car and try a plant-based burger (his way of suggesting we all need to go vegetarian or vegan!). These are covered in just 4 pages&#8212;like people are an afterthought to a billionaire. Admittedly, individual actions will only make a small contribution to the overall carbon reductions needed, but they are extremely important as they send a strong message to both government and corporations that citizens want and support major changes. Individual action has had an impact. The School Climate Strikes and the Extinction Rebellion protests have brought together diverse groups of people across the world, all wanting governments to start taking the protection of our planet seriously. And change is starting to happen, with over 1400 local governments and over 35 countries having declared that we are in a climate emergency. But Bill Gates&#8217;s book is very bland when it comes to politics and there is no mention of public agitation or protests about saving our planet.</p>
