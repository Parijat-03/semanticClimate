As argued above, the concept of planetary health, moving away from an obsession with planetary boundaries and climate tipping points, will provide a useful point of reference for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research that can cut across traditional boundaries between environmental sustainability and public health. The health perspective is, for example, instrumental in better integrating the risk of emerging infectious diseases within sustainable development planning (Di Marco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). Strengthening health systems through universal health coverage is essential for several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as no poverty, quality education and gender equality (Kieny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>). Since health and equality are closely linked to each other, protecting human and environmental health is conducive to the central pledge of SDGs: &#8220;leave no one behind&#8221;.</p>
