Our study revealed that only 65 (3.96%) of the 1641 cases used a litigation strategy which included climate change at the center, with extensive use of the word &#8220;health&#8221; mentioned in the case file submitted to the court. We identified a rise in explicitly health-linked cases over recent years. This rise is consistent with the general increase in litigation cases and is not specific to litigation pursued on public health grounds.</p>
