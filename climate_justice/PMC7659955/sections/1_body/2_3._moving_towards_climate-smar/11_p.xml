Another criticism on the policy and framework of CSA comes with the injustice meted to smallholder farmers, as a result of the implementation of the concept [<xref rid="B87-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. By administering interview to some CSA experts, analysis based on a number of ethical positions showed that implementation of climate-smart agricultural approaches is not fair, especially with respect to allocation of income benefits and challenges of cost associated with emission reduction [<xref rid="B87-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], among smallholders farmers and small agricultural processing industries. Budiman [<xref rid="B87-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] further argued that based on how climate justice works, sharing of income benefits should depend on the financial capability of farmers.</p>
