Observed trends over land show large geographical heterogeneity (Figure&#160;10.20d) and notable differences exist amongst different datasets at grid point scale (Figure&#160;10.20c; Qasmi et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.77" top="642.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="642.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 642.6; y1: 652.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Several mechanisms have been proposed for the enhanced Mediterranean warming, although their relative importance and the possible interplay between them are not fully understood. Circulation changes might have contributed to this enhanced warming (Figure&#160;10.20a). Sutton and Dong (2012) argued that the AMV induced a&#160;shift around the 1990s towards warmer southern European summers. This mechanism is associated with a&#160;linear baroclinic atmospheric response to the AMV-related surface heat flux. Also O&#8217;Reilly et&#160;al. (2017) related warm summer decades to the AMV, but the connection was shown to be mainly thermodynamic. Qasmi et&#160;al. (2021) estimate an increase in Mediterranean summer temperature of 0.2&#176;C&#8211;0.8&#176;C during a&#160;positive AMV.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="486.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="486.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Increased warming over land compared to the sea is expected due to the lapse-rate changes associated with tropospheric moisture contrasts (Kr&#246;ner et&#160;al., 2017; Byrne and O&#8217;Gorman, 2018; Brogli et&#160;al., 2019b; Figure&#160;10.20a). Enhanced land&#8211;sea temperature contrast leads to relative humidity and soil moisture feedbacks (Rowell and Jones, 2006), the latter also depending on weather regimes (Quesada et&#160;al., 2012). The globally enhanced land&#8211;sea contrast in near surface temperature is also a&#160;robust result in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Section&#160;4.5.1.1).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.78" top="378.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="378.6" x1="298.78" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Due to its semi-arid climate, strong atmosphere&#8211;land coupling has contributed to the larger increase of mean summer temperature compared to the increase of annual mean temperature (Seneviratne et&#160;al., 2006). In particular, during drought spells, limits to evaporation due to low soil moisture provide a&#160;positive feedback and enhances the intensity of heatwaves (Lorenz et&#160;al., 2016; Box&#160;11.1). By&#160;comparing reanalysis-driven RCM simulations with observations, Knist et&#160;al. (2017) found that RCMs are able to reproduce soil moisture interannual variability, spatial patterns, and annual cycles of surface fluxes over the period 1990&#8211;2008, revealing a&#160;strong land&#8211;atmosphere coupling especially in southern Europe in summer.&#160;In addition cloud feedbacks can modulate the Mediterranean summer temperature (Mariotti and Dell&#8217;Aquila, 2012).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.78" top="210.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="210.6" x1="298.78" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 210.6; y1: 220.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The observed trends over 1901&#8211;2010 are outside the range of internal variability shown in CMIP5 pre-industrial control experiments and consistent with, or greater than those simulated by experiments including both anthropogenic and natural forcings (Knutson et&#160;al., 2013) and therefore partly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. The decrease of anthropogenic aerosols over Europe including the Mediterranean resulting from European de-industrialisation and air pollution policies (Turnock et&#160;al., 2016) has been highlighted as an important contributor to the observed warming (Ruckstuhl et&#160;al.,&#160;2008; Philipona et&#160;al., 2009; de Laat and Crok, 2013; Nabat et&#160;al., 2014; Besselaar et&#160;al., 2015; Dong et&#160;al., 2017; Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020a). Pfeifroth et&#160;al. (2018) argue that this brightening is mainly due to cloud changes caused by the indirect aerosol effect with a&#160;minor role for the direct aerosol effect, in contrast to Nabat et&#160;al. (2014) and </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.28" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.28" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 316.12; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">model sensitivity experiments, Nabat et&#160;al. (2014) also associated the increase in Mediterranean SST since 1980&#8211;2012 with the decrease in aerosol concentrations (Atlas.8.2, Atlas.8.3 and Atlas.8.5).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="666.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="666.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 315.07; y0: 666.6; y1: 676.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Over the period 1960&#8211;2014, observed trends over land are consistent with those of most of the multi-model or SMILEs ensembles (Figure&#160;10.20f), although large differences exist for individual models and ensemble members. The modelled ensemble-mean trends show large geographical variations. Generally, both global and regional models often underestimate the observed trend especially over parts of North Africa, Italy, the Balkans and Turkey. The cold bias in global models is related to simulated SLP trends that are anti-correlated to the observed trend, which is probably due to systematic model errors (Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020b). Biases in the simulation of soil-moisture and cloud-cover might also have contributed to the underestimation of the warming trend in GCMs (van Oldenborgh et&#160;al., 2009). The CORDEX results (at both 0.44&#176; and 0.11&#176; resolution) show consistently smaller values than those in global models and the available datasets (Figure&#160;10.20g; Vautard et&#160;al., 2021). This is partly due to the overestimation in the temperature evolution before 1990 (Figure&#160;10.20e), possibly because of differences in the aerosol forcing (Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020a), although the driving global models also have a&#160;cold bias (Vautard et&#160;al., 2021). Cold biases for recent decades are also found in Med-CORDEX simulations (Dell&#8217;Aquila et&#160;al., 2018) and by RCM simulations over the southern part of the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa region (Almazroui, 2016; Almazroui et&#160;al., 2016a, b; Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017; Ozturk et&#160;al., 2018), although higher resolution, new bare soil albedo and modified aerosol parametrization significantly improve the results (Bucchignani et&#160;al., 2016a, b, 2018). Despite large differences in the multi-model mean trend (Figure&#160;10.20g), in most of the land points the observed trend lies within the model range in all ensembles. For the SST bias exhibited by coupled RCMs the choice of driving global model has the largest impact (Darmaraki et&#160;al., 2019; Soto-Navarro et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="546.44" top="294.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="294.48" x1="546.44" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 294.48; y1: 304.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.4.6 Future Climate Information From Global Simulations</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="270.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="270.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change hotspots (Diffenbaugh and Giorgi, 2012). CMIP5, CMIP6, HighResMIP and CORDEX (Section&#160;10.6.4.7) simulations all project a&#160;future warming for the 21st&#160;century that ranges between 3.5&#176;C and 8.75&#176;C for RCP8.5 at the end of this century for those ending at 2100 (Figure&#160;10.21a,&#160;b). CMIP6 results project more pronounced warming than CMIP5 for a&#160;given emissions scenario and time period (Figure&#160;10.21c; Coppola et&#160;al., 2020). However, when analysing the Mediterranean warming in terms of mean global warming levels, the two ensembles largely agree, showing that summer warming is projected to reach values up to 40&#8211;50% larger than the global annual warming, largely independent of models and emissions scenarios (Figure&#160;10.21d). Large regional differences exist, with enhanced warming projected over Turkey, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and North African regions (Figures&#160;10.14a, 10.21c; Almazroui et&#160;al., 2020a) and reaching, locally, values of up to double the global mean (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018). The enhanced summer warming also increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle (Yettella and England, 2018).</span></div></body></html>
