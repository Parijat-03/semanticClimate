These contributions encourage the integration of the GSW stream into the existing social work educational system. With over ten years of development, GSW remains marginalized in mainstream social work education in Canada and internationally [<xref rid="B3-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, in order to equip social workers with the capacity to address the disaster-specific, multi-dimensional influences and compounded impacts, pedagogical approaches need to enhance the social worker&#8217;s comprehension of the interconnections among different societal dimensions on the local residents. Then, social workers can better mobilize their expertise to support vulnerable individuals and families (micro-level), reconstruct affected communities and agencies (mezzo-level), and inform the policy/decision-making (macro-level). Post-secondary social work education experience is expected to strengthen students&#8217; learning and cognitive aspects of adaptive capacity to effectively respond to these changing environments [<xref rid="B27-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; however, current GSW pedagogical explorations in Canada have not, so far, effectively addressed this component.</p>
