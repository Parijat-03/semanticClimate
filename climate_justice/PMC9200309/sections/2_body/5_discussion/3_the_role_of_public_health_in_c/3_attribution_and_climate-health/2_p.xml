For example, in <italic toggle="yes">Neubauer et al</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">v Germany</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 4), plaintiffs cite IPCC data showing the risk of death, injury, and damage to health in low-lying coastal areas vulnerable to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. Plaintiffs cited robust evidence of the link between rising allergies and lengthening pollen seasons, between respiratory diseases and both ragweed blooms and flood-induced indoor mould growth, and storm/flood disasters and psychological trauma. This is supported by the conclusion drawn by McCormick et al. (2018) that &#8220;the strength of the scientific evidence mustered to support litigants&#8217; challenges is likely to be an important determinant of case outcomes&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p>
