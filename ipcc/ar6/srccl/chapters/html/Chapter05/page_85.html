The heatwave in Russia was extreme in both temperature (over 40&#176;C) and duration (from July to mid-August in 2010). This reduced wheat yields by approximately one third (Wegren 2011; Marchand et al. 2016). Simultaneously, in the Indus Valley in Pakistan, unprecedented rainfall led to flooding, affecting the lives and livelihoods of 20&#160;million people. There is evidence that these effects were both linked and made more likely through climate change (Mann et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.05" top="555.12"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 555.12; y1: 564.62; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="555.12" x1="299.05">In response to its shortfall in yields, Russia imposed an export ban in order to maintain local food supplies. Other countries responded in a&#160;largely uncoordinated ways, each of them driven by internal politics as well as national self-interests (Jones and Hiller 2017). Overall, these measures led to rapid price rises on the global markets (Welton 2011), partly through panic buying, but&#160;also through financial speculation (Spratt 2013). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.1" top="447.14"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 447.14; y1: 456.64; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="447.14" x1="299.1">Analysis of responses to higher food prices in the developing world showed that lower-income groups responded by taking on more employment, reducing food intake, limiting expenditures, spending savings (if available), and participating in demonstrations. People often identified their problems as stemming from collusion between powerful incumbent interests (e.g.,&#160;of politicians and big business) and disregard for the poor (Hossain and Green 2011). This politicised social response helped spark food-related civil protest, including riots, across a&#160;range of countries in 2010&#8211;2011 (Natalini et al. 2017). In Pakistan, food price rises were exacerbated by the economic impacts of the floods, which further contributed to food-related riots in 2010. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.07" top="279.16"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.94; y0: 279.16; y1: 288.66; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="279.16" x1="299.07">Price spikes also impact on food security in the developed world. In the UK, global commodity price inflation influenced local food prices, increasing food-price inflation by about five times at the end of 2010. Comparing household purchases over the five-year period from 2007 to 2011 showed that the amount of food bought declined, on average, by&#160;4.2%, whilst paying 12% more for it. The lowest income decile spent 17% more by 2011 than they did in 2007 (Holding et al. 2013; Tadasse et al. 2016). Consumers also saved money by trading down for cheaper alternatives. For the poorest, in the extreme situation, food became unaffordable: the Trussell Trust, a&#160;charity supplying emergency food handouts for people in crisis, noted a&#160;50% increase in handouts in 2010.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="197.81" top="86.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 86.98; y1: 96.98; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="86.98" x1="197.81">1.8.2 Migration and conflict</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="711.11"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.93; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="711.11" x1="571.75">Since the IPCC AR5 (Porter et al. 2014; Cramer et al. 2014), new work has advanced multi-factor methodological issues related to migration and conflict (e.g.,&#160;Kelley et al. 2015, 2017; Werrell et al. 2015; Challinor et al. 2018; Pasini et al. 2018).

Though the initial driver of migration may differ across populations, countries and contexts, migrants tend to seek the same fundamental objective: to provide security and adequate living conditions for their families and themselves. Food insecurity is a&#160;critical &#8216;push&#8217; factor driving international migration, along with conflict, income inequality, and population growth. The act of migration itself causes food insecurity, given the lack of income opportunities and adverse conditions compounded by conflict situations. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="207.12"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.28; y0: 207.12; y1: 216.62; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="207.12" x1="571.78">Warner et al.
