The annual value of the world&#8217;s total terrestrial ecosystem services has been estimated to be about 75 trillion USD in 2011, approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross Domestic Product (based on USD2007 values) (Costanza et al.&#160;2014; IMF 2018). Land also supports non-material ecosystem services such as cognitive and spiritual enrichment and aesthetic values (Hern&#225;ndez-Morcillo et al.&#160;2013; Fish et al.&#160;2016), intangible services that shape societies, cultures and human well-being. Exposure of people living in cities to (semi-)natural environments has been found to decrease mortality, cardiovascular disease and depression (Rook 2013; Terraube et al.&#160;2017). Non-material and regulating ecosystem services have been found to decline globally and rapidly, often at the expense of increasing material services (Fischer et al.&#160;2018; IPBES 2018a). Climate change will exacerbate diminishing land and freshwater resources, increase biodiversity loss, and will intensify societal vulnerabilities, especially in regions where economies are highly dependent on natural resources. Enhancing food security and reducing malnutrition, whilst also halting and reversing deserti&#64257;cation and land degradation, are fundamental societal challenges that are increasingly aggravated by the need to both adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts without compromising the non-material bene&#64257;ts of land (Kongsager&#160;et al.&#160;2016; FAO et al.&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="339.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 339.56; y1: 349.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="339.56" x1="313.26">Annual emissions of GHGs and other climate forcers continue to increase unabatedly. </span><span style="x0: 144.95; x1: 150.05; y0: 327.56; y1: 337.06; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="144.95" y0="327.56" x1="187.95">Con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 189.3; x1: 191.41; y0: 327.56; y1: 337.06; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="189.3" y0="327.56" x1="197.31">is </span><span style="x0: 198.66; x1: 202.71; y0: 327.56; y1: 337.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="198.66" y0="327.56" x1="235.74">very high </span><span style="x0: 237.1; x1: 239.91; y0: 327.56; y1: 337.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="237.1" y0="327.56" x1="313.25">that the window of opportunity, the period when signi&#64257;cant change can be made, for limiting climate change within tolerable boundaries is rapidly narrowing (Schaeffer et al.&#160;2015; Bertram et al.&#160;2015; Riahi et al.&#160;2015; Millar et al.&#160;2017; Rogelj et al.&#160;2018a). The Paris Agreement formulates the goal of limiting global warming this century to well below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels, for which rapid actions are required across the energy,&#160;transport, infrastructure and agricultural sectors, while factoring in the need for these sectors to accommodate a&#160;growing human population (Wynes and Nicholas 2017; Le Quere et al.&#160;2018). Conversion of natural land, and land management, are signi&#64257;cant net contributors to GHG emissions and climate change, but land ecosystems are also a&#160;GHG sink (Smith et al.&#160;2014; Tubiello et al.&#160;2015; Le Quere et al.&#160;2018; Ciais et al.&#160;2013a). It is not surprising, therefore, that land plays a&#160;prominent role in many of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the parties to the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al.&#160;2018a,b; Grassi et al.&#160;2017; Forsell et al.&#160;2016), and land-measures will be part of the NDC review by&#160;2023.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.18; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.58" x1="571.78">A range of different climate change mitigation and adaptation options on land exist, which differ in terms of their environmental and societal implications (Meyfroidt 2018; Bonsch et al.&#160;2016; Crist et al.&#160;2017; Humpenoder et al.&#160;2014; Harvey and Pilgrim 2011; Mouratiadou et al.&#160;2016; Zhang et al.&#160;2015; Sanz-Sanchez et al.&#160;2017; Pereira et al.&#160;2010; Griscom et al.&#160;2017; Rogelj et al.&#160;2018a) (Chapters&#160;4&#8211;6). The Special Report on climate change, deserti&#64257;cation, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and GHG &#64258;uxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL) synthesises the current state of scienti&#64257;c knowledge on the issues speci&#64257;ed in the report&#8217;s title (Figure&#160;1.1 and Figure&#160;1.2). This knowledge is assessed in the context of the Paris Agreement, but many of the SRCCL issues concern other international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (UNCBD), the UN Convention to Combat Deserti&#64257;cation (UNCCD), the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) and the UN Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SRCCL is the &#64257;rst report in which land is the central focus since the IPCC Special Report on land use, land-use change and forestry (Watson et al.&#160;2000) (Box&#160;1.1). The main objectives of the SRCCL are to:</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="483.62"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.28; y0: 483.62; y1: 493.12; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="483.62" x1="571.75">1.
