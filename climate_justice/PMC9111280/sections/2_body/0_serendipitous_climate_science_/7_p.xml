<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">What is particularly compelling about findings of Liu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) is that two separate datasets (air temperature and satellite&#8208;derived surface temperature) reveal a consistent signal. They attribute the reduced UHI to the anthropogenic heat release term. That term was generally reduced because of road closures, less traffic, and restrictions on industrial activities. It would be compelling to see this work replicated for other countries to any potential geographical, climatological, or seasonal factors. Additionally, it would be instructive in future studies to investigate whether a COVID&#8208;19 lockdown signal is detectable in subsurface or hydrological variables.</p>
