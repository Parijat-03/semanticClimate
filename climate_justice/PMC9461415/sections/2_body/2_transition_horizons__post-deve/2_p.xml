On the other hand, several indigenous, black peoples, rural smallholders, and other local communities are working toward autonomy and self-determination, solidary economy, and reclaiming human, territorial, and nature rights. Along with sustainable food production through agroecology and agroforest restorative practices, rural development based on sociobiodiversity conservation and decentralized governance for economic democracy, they are leading innovations in several fields, also inspiring sustainable transition horizons (Escobar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>; Kothari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2021</xref>; Ferreira and Fel&#237;cio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2022</xref>).</p>
