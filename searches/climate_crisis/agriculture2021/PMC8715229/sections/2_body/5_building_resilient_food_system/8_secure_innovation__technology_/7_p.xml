<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0535">Maintaining and accelerating innovation in the wake of the pandemic is important for developing new and alternative food sources. The potential of alternative and novel foods in improving food and nutritional health, while reducing environmental impacts, needs to be further explored. This includes a wide variety of existing but currently underutilized feed and food options, such as seaweeds and algae (e.g., <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Mahadevan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Tiji et al., 2020</xref>), and insects (<xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">van Huis and Oonincx, 2020</xref>). Cultured meat, derived from cells grown in the laboratory can potentially be tailored to meet specific nutritional needs while also reducing the pressure on land and natural resources, but large-scale production continues to be challenging (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Moritz et al., 2015</xref>) and questions about environmental sustainability of production need to be further explored (<xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">Sergelidis, 2019</xref>). While shifts to more plant-based diets will reduce the pressure on land, cultured meat may not have an advantage over shifting from beef to poultry (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2017</xref>). However, expanding the variety of future foods, ranging from plant-based options to insects and cultured meats, needs to be considered for strengthening the health and sustainability aspects of diets (<xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Parodi et al., 2018</xref>), complemented by efforts to lessen environmental footprints associated with food loss and waste (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>).</p>
