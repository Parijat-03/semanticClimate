<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0120">Another means to encourage action during participatory educational processes lies in gamification <xref rid="b0675" ref-type="bibr">[135]</xref>. &#8216;Role playing&#8217; and &#8216;serious games&#8217; have been used for social learning and simulating transitions across various environment, energy, and climate issues <xref rid="b0680" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>, <xref rid="b0685" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>, <xref rid="b0690" ref-type="bibr">[138]</xref>. Via companion modelling <xref rid="b0695" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>, models can be coupled with such games to capture insights of different collaborators and allow them to interact with or give rise to decision rules and behavioural elements, revealing stakeholder-induced effects. This interaction of actors with a simulated environment according to specific rules can be useful to transitions research aimed at citizen engagement, raising awareness, and understanding lifestyle changes <xref rid="b0700" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>. On one hand, robustness and completeness of analysis of sustainable transitions pathways are enhanced: climate and climate-economy modelling can be integrated with game outputs <xref rid="b0705" ref-type="bibr">[141]</xref>, by incorporating elicited information, including players&#8217; lifestyle choices, which can determine emissions reductions from reference scenarios when scaled up from individual to local, to national and global levels. On the other hand, gaming can be both educational <xref rid="b0710" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref> and entertaining <xref rid="b0715" ref-type="bibr">[143]</xref> for the players: upon linking bottom-up preferences to top-down modelling assessments of behaviours and policies across energy, transport, food and buildings, engaged citizens can interact with one another, be informed on latest scientific findings, explore lifestyle options <xref rid="b0720" ref-type="bibr">[144]</xref> leading to different climate results, and experience the role of one another, increasing mutual understanding <xref rid="b0725" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref> and social learning <xref rid="b0730" ref-type="bibr">[146]</xref>. Nevertheless, few studies have so far looked at the long-term maintenance/feasibility? of positive behavioural shifts resulting from gamification <xref rid="b0735" ref-type="bibr">[147]</xref>.</p>
