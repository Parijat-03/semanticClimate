<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Changes in <em>glacier</em> or <em>ice sheet</em> mass controlled by changes in flow speed and discharge rather than by <em>accumulation</em> or ablation.</p>
<p>This can result in a rate of mass change larger than that due to any imbalance between accumulation and ablation. Rapid dynamical change may be initiated by a climatic trigger, such as incursion of warm ocean water beneath an <em>ice shelf</em>, or thinning of a grounded tide-water terminus, which may lead to reactions within the glacier system that may result in rapid ice loss.</p>
