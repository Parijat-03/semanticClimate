      <td>some areas, generating higher productivity per unit area of\nland, can allow other land to provide other ecosystem services,\nsuch as increased carbon sequestration and the conservation\nof natural ecosystems and biodiversity (Balmford et al. 2018\nand Strassburg et al. 2014). Conversely under a land sharing\nstrategy, less, or no, land is set aside, but lower levels of\nintensification are applied to agricultural land, providing\na combination of provisioning and other functions such as\nbiodiversity conservation from the same land (Green et al.\n2005). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and\nthe suitability of their application is generally system-, scale-\nand/or location-specific (Fischer et al. 2014). One crucial issue\nfor the success of a land sparing strategy is that spared land\nis protected from further conversion. As the profits from the\nintensively managed land increase, there is an incentive for\nconversion of additional land for production (Byerlee et al.\n2014). Furthermore, it is implicit that there are limits to the SI\nof land at a local and also planetary boundary level (Rockstr&#246;m\net al. 2009). These may relate to the &#8216;health&#8217; of soil, the\npresence of supporting services, such as pollination, local limits\nto water availability, or limits on air quality. This implies that it\nmay not be possible to meet demand &#8216;sustainably&#8217; if demand\nexceeds local and global limits. There are no single global\nsolutions to these challenges and specific in situ responses for\ndifferent farming systems and locations are required. Baj&#382;elj\net al. (2014) showed that implementation of SI, primarily\nthrough yield gap closure, had better environmental outcomes\ncompared with &#8216;business as usual&#8217; trajectories. However, SI\nalone will not be able to deliver the necessary environmental\noutcomes from the food system &#8211; dietary change and reduced\nfood waste are also required (Springmann et al. 2018a; Baj&#382;elj\net al. 2014).</td>

      <td>a growing human population necessitates intensification\nof current land use to avoid conversion of additional land\nto agriculture and potentially allow the sparing of land\nto provide other ecosystem services, including carbon\nsequestration, production of biomass for energy, and the\nprotection of biodiversity (Benton et al. 2018; Garnett et al.\n2013). Land-use intensity may be defined in terms of three\ncomponents; (i) intensity of system inputs (land/soil, capital,\nlabour, knowledge, nutrients and other chemicals), (ii)\nintensity of system outputs (yield per unit land area or per\nspecific input) and (iii) the impacts of land use on ecosystem\nservices such as changes in soil carbon or biodiversity (Erb\net al. 2013). Intensified land use can lead to ecological\ndamage as well as degradation of soil, resulting in a loss\nof function which underpins many ecosystem services\n(Wilhelm and Smith 2018; Smith et al. 2016). Therefore, there\nis a risk that increased agricultural intensification could\ndeliver short-term production goals at the expense of future\nproductive potential, jeopardising long term food security\n(Tilman et al. 2011).</td>

      <td>Agroecosystems which maintain or improve the natural\nand human capital and services they provide may be\ndefined as sustainable systems, while those which deplete\nthese assets as unsustainable (Pretty and Bharucha 2014).\nProducing more food, fuel and fibre without the conversion\nof additional non-agricultural land while simultaneously\nreducing environmental impacts requires what has been\ntermed sustainable intensification (Godfray et al. 2010; FAO\n2011e) (Glossary and Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box).\nSustainable intensification (SI) may be achieved through\na wide variety of means; from improved nutrient and water\nuse efficiency via plant and animal breeding programmes,\nto the implementation of integrated soil fertility and pest\nmanagement practices, as well as by smarter land-use\nallocation at a larger spatial scale: for example, matching\nland use to the context and specific capabilities of the\nland (Benton et al. 2018). However, implementation of SI\nis broader than simply increasing the technical efficiency\nof agriculture (&#8216;doing more with less&#8217;). It sometimes may\nrequire a reduction of yields to raise sustainability, and\nsuccessful implementation can be dependent on place and\nscale. Pretty et al. (2018), following Hill (1985), highlights\nthree elements to SI: (i) increasing efficiency, (ii) substitution\nof less beneficial or efficient practices for better ones, and (iii)\nsystem redesign to adopt new practices and farming systems\n(Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box).</td>
