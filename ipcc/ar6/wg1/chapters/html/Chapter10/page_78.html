Model ensemble results presented as the 90th-percentile range of relative 30-year running means of rainfall and the SAM index from 35 CMIP5 (blue shading) and 35&#160;CMIP6 (red shading) simulations, 6 CORDEX simulations driven by 1 to 10 GCMs (cyan shading), 6 CCAM (purple shading) simulations from individual ensemble members, and 50 members from the MIROC6 SMILE simulations (orange shading). The light blue, dark red and yellow lines correspond to NCEP/NCAR, ERA20C and 20CR, respectively. The SAM index is calculated from sea level pressure reanalysis and GCM data as per Gong and Wang (1999) and averaged over the aforementioned bounding box. CMIP5, CORDEX and CCAM projections use RCP8.5, and CMIP6 and MIROC6 SMILE projections use SSP5-8.5. </span><span style="x0: 348.65; x1: 351.02; y0: 140.34; y1: 148.34; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="348.65" y0="140.34" x1="359.76">(d) </span><span x0="359.55" y0="140.34" x1="557.21" style="x0: 359.55; x1: 364.0; y0: 140.34; y1: 148.34; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: MQDQUF+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">Historical and projected trends in rainfall over the Cape Town region and in the SAM index. Observations and gridded data processed as in (c). Trends calculated as Theil-Sen trend with block-bootstrap confidence interval estimate. Markers show median trend, bars 95% confidence interval. Global models in each CMIP group were ordered according to the magnitude of trend in rainfall, and the same order is maintained in panels showing trends in the SAM.
