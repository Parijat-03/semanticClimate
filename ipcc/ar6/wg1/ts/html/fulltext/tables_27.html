      <td>This box synthesizes the outcomes of the assessment of past, current and future global surface temperature. Global mean surface\ntemperature (GMST) and global surface air temperature (GSAT) are the two primary metrics of global surface temperature used to\nestimate global warming in IPCC reports. GMST merges sea surface temperature (SST) over the ocean and 2 m air temperature over\nland and sea ice areas and is used in most paleo, historical and present-day observational estimates. The GSAT metric is 2 m air\ntemperature over all surfaces and is the diagnostic generally used from climate models. Changes in GMST and GSAT over time differ\nby at most 10% in either direction (high confidence), but conflicting lines of evidence from models and direct observations, combined\nwith limitations in theoretical understanding, lead to low confidence in the sign of any difference in long-term trend. Therefore,\nlong-term changes in GMST/GSAT are presently assessed to be identical, with expanded uncertainty in GSAT estimates. Hence the term\nglobal surface temperature is used in reference to both quantities in the text of the TS and SPM. {Cross-Chapter Box 2.3}</td>

      <td>Global surface temperature has increased by 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10] &#176;C from 1850&#8211;1900 to the first two decades of the\n21st century (2001&#8211;2020) and by 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] &#176;C from 1850&#8211;1900 to 2011&#8211;2020. Temperatures as high as\nduring the most recent decade (2011&#8211;2020) exceed the warmest centennial-scale range reconstructed for the present\ninterglacial, around 6500 years ago [0.2&#176;C to 1&#176;C] (medium confidence). The next most recent warm period was\nabout 125,000 years ago during the last interglacial when the multi-centennial temperature range [0.5&#176;C to 1.5&#176;C]\nencompasses the 2011&#8211;2020 values (medium confidence). The likely range of human-induced change in global surface\ntemperature in 2010&#8211;2019 relative to 1850&#8211;1900 is 0.8&#176;C to 1.3&#176;C, with a central estimate of 1.07&#176;C, encompassing\nthe best estimate of observed warming for that period, which is 1.06&#176;C with a very likely range of [0.88&#176;C to 1.21&#176;C],\nwhile the likely range of the change attributable to natural forcing is only &#8211;0.1&#176;C to +0.1&#176;C.\nCompared to 1850&#8211;1900, average global surface temperature over the period 2081&#8211;2100 is very likely to be higher by\n[1.0&#176;C to 1.8&#176;C] in the low CO emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 and by [3.3&#176;C to 5.7&#176;C] in the high CO emissions scenario\n2 2\nSSP5-8.5. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of 20-year averaged global surface\nwarming crossing the 1.5&#176;C level lies in the early 2030s, which is in the early part of the likely range (2030&#8211;2052)\nassessed in SR1.5. It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, global surface temperature relative to 1850&#8211;1900 will\nremain below 1.6&#176;C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot of 1.5&#176;C global warming\nof no more than 0.1&#176;C. Global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5&#176;C relative to 1850&#8211;1900\nby 2030 with a likelihood between 40% and 60% across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence). A 2&#176;C\nincrease in global surface temperature relative to 1850&#8211;1900 will be crossed under SSP5-8.5 but is extremely unlikely\nto be crossed under SSP1-1.9. Periods of reduced and increased global surface temperature trends at decadal time\nscales will continue to occur in the 21st century (very high confidence). The effect of strong mitigation on 20-year\nglobal surface temperature trends would be likely to emerge during the near term (2021&#8211;2040), assuming no major\nvolcanic eruptions occur.
