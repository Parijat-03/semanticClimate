<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The EECO is a period of geological time that occurred about 53 to 49 million years ago, during the Eocene Epoch.</p>
<p>Continental positions at this time were somewhat different to present due to tectonic plate movements. Geological data indicate that the EECO was a period of relatively high atmospheric CO2 concentrations (about 1150–2500 ppmv) and relative warmth (<em>global mean surface temperature</em> was about 10–18 °C above the 1850–1900 reference), and polar <em>ice sheets</em> were absent.</p>
