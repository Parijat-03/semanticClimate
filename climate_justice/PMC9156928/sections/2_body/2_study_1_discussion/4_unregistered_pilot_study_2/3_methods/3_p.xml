<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As in Study 1, participants first underwent a screening survey to exclude those not believing in anthropogenic global heating and those who attended more than one climate activism event prior to the study (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Those passing the screening signed a consent form agreeing to complete online surveys and to attend a 1.5 h in-person event every week for six weeks. Everyone first completed a baseline survey measuring the same 11 psychological factors and self-reported climate-related behaviors as Study 1. Then, every Monday night, participants gathered in a classroom at UC San Diego. Here, a study member coordinated an ice-breaking activity: solving riddles in groups of three or four. Then, she showed two 25-min videos (the same videos from Study 1), after which the participants took a four-question comprehension quiz on their mobile phone. They were prompted to respond to the last two questions of the quiz collectively in groups of three to four to engage each other in a conversation about the video content. After this, an activist guest from the climate org UCSD Green New Deal came into the room and described a bulletin of events for her organization for the following five days. A comprehension quiz followed with participants responding to the last two questions in groups. If participants did not show up at the Monday session or did not complete any of the comprehension quizzes, they incurred a $20 penalty. At the activism events, a confederate tracked attendance by having all attendees fill in a sign-up sheet. At the end of the six weeks, participants again completed the survey measuring the 11 psychological factors and self-reported behaviors. There was a group debrief activity during the last in-person session.</p>
