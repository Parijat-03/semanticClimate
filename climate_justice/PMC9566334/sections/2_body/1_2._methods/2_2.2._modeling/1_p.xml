<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Two models were developed using a Bayesian spatial temporal ecological regression methodology. One model applied SUHI intensity across all census tracts from 2003 to 2018 (44,476 in number for 16 years) as the response with the percentages of each population group as explanatory variables. The second model utilized the inter-city dataset (n = 191 &#215; 16 years), with mean city-wide SUHI intensity as the response and the <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> segregation index as an explanatory variable.</p>
