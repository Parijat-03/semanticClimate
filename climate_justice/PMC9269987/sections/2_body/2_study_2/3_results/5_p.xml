<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To reduce our comparably complex model on pro-environmental intention, a stepwise regression analysis with statistical backward elimination (based on AIC) was conducted to identify the relevant predictors. According to a backward-elimination strategy, victim sensitivity, shame proneness, and gratitude were excluded from the final regression model (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.252). This final model (Model A-) can be found in <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> as well as in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Consequently, the final model included the following predictors: perpetrator, beneficiary, and observer sensitivity, moral disengagement in high carbon behavior, guilt-proneness, and authentic and hubristic pride. This final model significantly predicted pro-environmental intention, <italic>F</italic>(7, 872) = 54.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, with a large effect size, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.30 (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.29).</p>
