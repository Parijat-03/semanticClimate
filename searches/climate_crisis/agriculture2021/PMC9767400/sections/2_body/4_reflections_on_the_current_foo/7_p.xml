The current COVID-19 crisis has exposed how vulnerable the global food systems are and that urgent measures need to be taken (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aday and Aday, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Headey and Ruel, 2020</xref>). This paper makes a convincing argument for the adoption of a strong gender lens in food systems. Given the central role women play in production and household food management, finding solutions to gender inequalities - the major hurdles to women and communities food insecurity - is highly critical. Furthermore, given women are among those being most food insecure, addressing the key factors central to this predicament will be a crucial part of achieving global food security. Addressing gender inequalities to food security necessitates an integrated approach that considers different local aspects that may hinder progress. It is critical to acknowledge that gender inequality in poor communities is embedded in other challenges affecting communities in general. This implies that gender inequalities should be analysed in the context of all other challenges the communities face, including issues of poverty, issues of health and well-being, problems of access to clean water and sanitation, decent work, and climate change crisis, and how they affect food security endeavors. Also, it is imperative that different people (and therein women), even in a seemingly homogenous community have different abilities, needs and capacities, thus solutions devised must reflect these diverse realities. Doing so will provide for more nuance in policy and practice towards resilient and sustainable food systems, and food secure communities accordingly.</p>
