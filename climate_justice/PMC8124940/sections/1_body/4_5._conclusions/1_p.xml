Our statistical results reveal that several variables denoting social vulnerability are significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) related to both UHRI and NDVI. Specifically, our multivariable models indicate that the May UHRI has a positive relationship with proportions of children and agricultural workers, and a negative relationship with proportions of households with assets and those with electricity. In contrast, the May NDVI is not significantly associated with the proportions of children and agricultural workers, while it shows a positive relationship with proportions of households with assets and electricity. In September, the proportion of agricultural workers shows an interesting shift to a positive relationship with NDVI possibly due to increase in planted crops. These findings from Delhi collectively reveal that vulnerable demographic and economic groups are less likely to be able to mitigate heat stress as they comprise young children, outdoor agricultural workers, and households lacking assets and electricity, so that a situation of climate injustice is very clearly demonstrated. Poised to become the most populous city in the world by 2030 [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it is likely that impervious surfaces in Delhi will continue to expand leading to further intensification of the urban heat island effect and loss of greenspace. Our study therefore makes a valuable contribution to incorporating climate justice considerations in Delhi&#8217;s climate change planning by demonstrating which vulnerable groups should be prioritized in policies related to mitigation of heat stress.</p>
