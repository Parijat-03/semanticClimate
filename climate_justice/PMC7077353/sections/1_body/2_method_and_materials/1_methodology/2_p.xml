<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">GENNOVATE uses a comparative case study approach deploying standardised instruments to identify factors that hinder or facilitate and promote men and women&#8217;s individual and collective capacities for engaging in innovation processes. The methods are qualitative sex-segregated focus group discussions (FGD) and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with participants of different ages. The adult FGDs are sub-divided by economic class with respondents drawn from poor and middle-income categories using locally developed classifications. One-on-one interviews are held with locally recognised innovators. Landless women and men, who neither own nor lease land, are not included as a analytic category although they may be active in agriculture-related occupations. In all cases the facilitators and note takers are of the same gender as the respondents. The tools are summarised in Table A1 (Online Appendix).</p>
