For example, the location of a shadow site could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions with new development and use of the site. For example, many of these shadow stadia are located on public transportation grids already, so when the site is being redeveloped the existing transit system could be incorporated into the new design, and ultimately lead to shorter commutes and decreased pollution, especially where new housing and density is created.</p>
