Although located or active in different places, the members of the network are connected on a&#160;normative level with common ways of thinking and visions, but also on a&#160;practical level, working together, acquiring knowledge, circulating and publishing it. Besides, activists and civic campaigners point to the responsibility of local and national governments and increasingly highlight their &#8220;role as market actors&#8221; who have to carry out their &#8220;regulatory influence on the market&#8221; (Kryst/Zajak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>: 63). They share the urge for innovative and social approaches, administration, and narratives, considering local peculiarities and characteristics, as the local is itself &#8220;restructured and reproduced in interaction with translocal influences&#8221; (Knecht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>: 25).</p>
