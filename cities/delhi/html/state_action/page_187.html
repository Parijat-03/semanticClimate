The doctor to population ratio in Delhi is 1:1,700 (Delhi Statistical Handbook, 2012), which is much lower than 1:1,000 recommended by the WHO (Mayor, 2008).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="246.73" top="617.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="617.43" x1="246.73" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 617.43; y1: 629.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The expected change in climatic patterns will lead to a corresponding increase in expenditure in the public health sector. The health impacts of climate change would disproportionately affect low income families and populations living in low lying areas. There is an apparent lack of adequate public health, drainage and pollution control services, which may lead to a low adaptive capacity to these impacts. Planned improvements of the aforementioned services would be required in order to adapt to these impacts on health. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="161.42" top="419.71"><span x0="72.02" y0="419.71" x1="161.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 419.71; y1: 430.75; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2.2 Energy  </span><span x0="72.02" y0="404.26" x1="526.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 404.26; y1: 416.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">About 60% of India&#8217;s power is generated through fossil fuels, leading to a large amount of carbon emissions and thus climate change. The generation is slated to increase with increased demand due to rise in temperature, thus leading to increase in long term climate change and shortage of electricity in the short term. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.32" top="328.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="328.78" x1="526.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 328.78; y1: 340.78; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The annual per capita consumption of electricity in Delhi is around 1,615 units. The residential sector accounts for 45 percent of total electricity consumption in Delhi.  A large majority of this is used to maintain thermal and visual comfort. Increasing temperatures may lead to increasing demand for maintenance of thermal comfort, which may lead to a shortage of electricity in Delhi (Gupta, 2011).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="127.7" top="237.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="237.43" x1="127.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 237.43; y1: 249.43; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure: </span><span x0="128.54" y0="237.43" x1="526.15" style="x0: 128.54; x1: 135.87; y0: 237.43; y1: 249.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">This demand is slated to increase, with demand for maintaining thermal comfort due to projected rise in temperature. This may therefore lead to shortage of power supply and increased power cuts. A study (for Delhi) performed at the Indian Statistical Institute shows that a 1&#176;C rise in temperature at 30&#176;C (Gupta, 2011) is expected to increase annual electricity demand by over 5 Million KWh by 2015, 6MKWh by 2020, 7 MKWh by 2025 and 8 MKWh by 2030 (Gupta, 2011). This trend indicates an incremental increase in the demand for electricity in Delhi with rising temperatures. This means that a projected rise of 1.5-4 degrees Celsius can lead to enormous rise in electricity demand.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.35" top="98.45"><span x0="72.02" y0="98.45" x1="132.35" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 98.45; y1: 110.45; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="132.38" y0="98.45" x1="526.18" style="x0: 132.38; x1: 141.04; y0: 98.45; y1: 110.45; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">According to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) surveys, number of households owning an air cooler or an air conditioner doubled from 32.9% in 1993 to 60% </span></div></body></html>
