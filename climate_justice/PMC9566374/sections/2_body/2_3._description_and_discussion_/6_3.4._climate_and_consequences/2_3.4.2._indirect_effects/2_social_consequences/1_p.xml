On the one hand, the scarcity of some products and greater demand for them can increase the price of basic goods such as water, food, and energy. Basic sectors such as housing can also be affected, due to damage and changes in the needs of buildings and other infrastructures, or work. The increase in thermal stress is expected to have a strong impact on productivity and occupational risks, which will translate into major job losses and worsening of labour conditions. Although the most affected sectors are expected to be agriculture and construction, other sectors will also be affected, such as transport, tourism, sports and some industrial jobs or even office work, due to the psychological fatigue produced by very high temperatures [<xref rid="B67-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a recent review on the impact of extreme heat on occupational injuries, hot Mediterranean climates were one of the climate zones identified as being at greatest risk [<xref rid="B68-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, these areas may experience significant job losses linked to the possible disruption of tourism associated with the consequences of climate change [<xref rid="B69-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
