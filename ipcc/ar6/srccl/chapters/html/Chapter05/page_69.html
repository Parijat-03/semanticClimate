Land-use intensity may be defined in terms of three components; (i) intensity of system inputs (land/soil, capital, labour, knowledge,&#160;nutrients and other chemicals), (ii) intensity of system outputs (yield per unit land area or per specific input) and (iii) the impacts of land use on ecosystem services such as changes in soil carbon or biodiversity (Erb et al. 2013). Intensified land use can lead to ecological damage as well as degradation of soil, resulting in a&#160;loss of function which underpins many ecosystem services (Wilhelm and Smith 2018;&#160;Smith et al. 2016). Therefore, there is a&#160;risk that increased agricultural intensification could deliver short-term production goals at the expense of future productive potential, jeopardising long term food security (Tilman et al. 2011). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.09" top="387.15"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 387.15; y1: 396.65; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="387.15" x1="299.09">Agroecosystems which maintain or improve the natural and human capital and services they provide may be defined as sustainable systems, while those which deplete these assets as unsustainable (Pretty and Bharucha 2014). Producing more food, fuel and fibre without the conversion of additional non-agricultural land while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts requires what has been termed sustainable intensification (Godfray et al. 2010; FAO 2011e) (Glossary and Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). Sustainable intensification (SI) may be achieved through a&#160;wide variety of means; from improved nutrient and water use efficiency via plant and animal breeding programmes, to the implementation of integrated soil fertility and pest management practices, as well as by smarter land-use allocation at a&#160;larger spatial scale: for example, matching land use to the context and specific capabilities of the land (Benton et al. 2018). However, implementation of SI is broader than simply increasing the technical efficiency of agriculture&#160;(&#8216;doing more with less&#8217;). It sometimes may require a&#160;reduction of yields to raise sustainability, and successful implementation can be dependent on place and scale. Pretty et al. (2018), following Hill (1985), highlights three elements to SI: (i)&#160;increasing efficiency, (ii) substitution of less beneficial or efficient practices for better ones, and (iii) system redesign to adopt new&#160;practices and farming systems (Table&#160;1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.1" top="63.19"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.99; y0: 63.19; y1: 72.69; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="63.19" x1="299.1">Under a&#160;land sparing strategy, intensification of land use in </span></div><div left="337.89" right="557.6" top="711.11"><span style="x0: 337.89; x1: 341.4; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="337.89" y0="711.11" x1="557.6">some areas, generating higher productivity per unit area of land, can&#160;allow other land to provide other ecosystem services, such as increased carbon sequestration and the conservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity (Balmford et al. 2018 and Strassburg et al. 2014). Conversely under a&#160;land sharing strategy, less, or&#160;no,&#160;land is set aside, but lower levels of intensification are applied to agricultural land, providing a&#160;combination of provisioning and other functions such as biodiversity conservation from the same land (Green et al. 2005). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and the suitability of their application is generally system-, scale- and/or location-specific (Fischer et al. 2014). One&#160;crucial issue for the success of a&#160;land sparing strategy is that spared land is protected from further conversion. As the profits from the intensively managed land increase, there is an incentive for conversion of additional land for production (Byerlee et al. 2014). Furthermore, it is implicit that there are limits to the SI of land at a&#160;local and also planetary boundary level (Rockstr&#246;m et al. 2009). These may relate to the &#8216;health&#8217; of soil, the presence of supporting services, such as pollination, local limits to water availability, or limits on air quality. This implies that it may not be possible to meet demand &#8216;sustainably&#8217; if demand exceeds local and global limits. There are no single global solutions to these challenges and specific in situ responses for different farming systems and locations are required. Baj&#382;elj et al. (2014) showed that implementation of SI, primarily through yield gap closure, had better environmental outcomes compared with &#8216;business as usual&#8217; trajectories. However, SI alone will not be able to deliver the necessary environmental outcomes from&#160;the food system&#160;&#8211; dietary change and reduced food waste are also required (Springmann et al. 2018a; Baj&#382;elj et al. 2014). </span></div></body></html>
