The Concept of Biodiversity Park was first developed in Delhi and was implemented for the first time in the world by DDA in joint collaboration with Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), University of Delhi. The 6 Biodiversity Parks notified by DDA are: Yamuna, Aravalli, Northern Ridge, Neela Hauz, Tilpath Valley, and Riverfront.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.27" top="645.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="645.27" x1="526.27" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 645.27; y1: 657.27; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The 7th Biodiversity Park is Tughlakabad. Except riverfront, all other Biodiversity are being developed. The Yamuna and Aravalli Biodiversity Parks are fully functional and have become Nature Reserves of Delhi having some 3,000 species living in 40 to 50 biological communities.  Biodiversity Parks are not only preserve natural heritage of the area but also have educational, conservation and cultural values. These Biodiversity Parks have been rendering a wide range of ecological services ranging from storage of flood water, recharging of ground water, cleaning air, buffering environment and imparting resilience to climate change, besides serving as tool to create environmental awareness through education. The Biodiversity Parks are owned and managed by DDA under Delhi Biodiversity Foundation. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.42" top="486.6"><span x0="72.02" y0="486.6" x1="526.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 486.6; y1: 498.6; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Forests, by acting as a sink for greenhouse gases, help mitigate the effects of climate change. However, forest biological diversity is also directly and indirectly impacted by changing climatic conditions. These changes question the degree to which forests will be able to continue sequestering greenhouse gases in the future. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="525.98" top="411.1"><span x0="72.02" y0="411.1" x1="525.98" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 411.1; y1: 423.1; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Ecosystem and climate models suggest that climate change will have a variety of impacts on the distribution of forest organisms and populations as well as impact ecosystem function and composition. It is expected that forest biodiversity will be forced to adapt and as a result species compositions in forests is likely to change and those species and populations which are already vulnerable will potentially become extinct. The impacts of climate change on the forest and agriculture include: </span></div><div left="72.02" right="77.54" top="299.14"><span x0="72.02" y0="299.14" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 299.14; y1: 311.14; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="299.14" x1="471.34" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 102.05; y0: 299.14; y1: 311.14; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Drastic alterations in the structure and organization of biological communities </span><span x0="72.02" y0="282.46" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 282.46; y1: 294.46; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="282.46" x1="280.97" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 104.05; y0: 282.46; y1: 294.46; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Marked changes in the flora and fauna </span></div><div left="72.02" right="77.54" top="265.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="265.63" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 265.63; y1: 277.63; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="265.63" x1="320.11" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 100.72; y0: 265.63; y1: 277.63; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Loss of species (plants, animals and microbes) </span><span x0="72.02" y0="248.95" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 248.95; y1: 260.95; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="248.95" x1="526.3" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 104.05; y0: 248.95; y1: 260.95; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many species with low ecological amplitude may be restricted in their distribution ranges </span><span x0="72.02" y0="232.27" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 232.27; y1: 244.27; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="232.27" x1="379.39" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 104.05; y0: 232.27; y1: 244.27; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many of the avenue trees and species in parks will be lost.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="77.54" top="215.47"><span x0="72.02" y0="215.47" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 215.47; y1: 227.47; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="215.47" x1="526.22" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 101.39; y0: 215.47; y1: 227.47; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Rapid decline in the primary productivity which in turn lead to the decline in the dependent animal species. </span><span x0="72.02" y0="182.95" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 182.95; y1: 194.95; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="182.95" x1="526.08" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 100.06; y0: 182.95; y1: 194.95; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Soils loose their life supporting potentials due to alteration in the physical, chemical and biological properties.  </span><span x0="72.02" y0="150.31" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 150.31; y1: 162.31; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="150.31" x1="197.88" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 100.72; y0: 150.31; y1: 162.31; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There will be less CO</span><span x0="197.93" y0="150.2" x1="201.95" style="x0: 197.93; x1: 201.95; y0: 150.2; y1: 158.24; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="205.01" y0="150.31" x1="417.79" style="x0: 205.01; x1: 209.68; y0: 150.31; y1: 162.31; width: 4.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">sequestration through biological processes.  </span><span x0="72.02" y0="133.63" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 133.63; y1: 145.63; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="133.63" x1="526.32" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 100.72; y0: 133.63; y1: 145.63; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There will be increase in the pest pathogenic loads and also increase in the incidence of diseases leading to epidemics. </span><span x0="72.02" y0="100.97" x1="77.54" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 100.97; y1: 112.97; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="93.38" y0="100.97" x1="526.21" style="x0: 93.38; x1: 100.06; y0: 100.97; y1: 112.97; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Shifting of species distribution from high elevation to low lying area under Scenario I and vise-versa under scenario II will occur. </span></div></body></html>
