<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">CES, HHAI, and SVI have distinct patterns of vulnerability across California&#8217;s census tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g001">Fig 1</xref>). CES, HHAI, and SVI are calculated based on different underlying indicators, grouped by the concept they represent in <xref rid="pone.0240841.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There is agreement across the three indices that Poverty, Educational Attainment, and Linguistic Isolation are significant concepts for determining vulnerability, but the indices differ in how they measure those concepts. For example, all three indices include at least one poverty-related indicator, but HHAI and SVI consider the percentage of the population below the poverty level while CES considers the percentage of the population below two times the poverty level.</p>
