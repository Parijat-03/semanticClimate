<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Among the health plans of the Group of Twenty, only two countries refer to climate change: France recognizes that global warming will contribute to an increase in vector-borne diseases and Indonesia acknowledges the need for subnational strategies to adapt to climate-related health consequences. No plans include an analysis of climate change or its impact on the ability of countries to deliver primary health care. The climate national adaptation plans of these countries (with the exception of the European Union, not included in the analysis) address the primary health-care component on multisectoral action, particularly with reference to water, sanitation and hygiene, and nutrition and agricultural interventions; however, the other two components are largely ignored. South Africa called for scaling up of existing public health interventions in response to the climate crisis, and India and the United States of America included specific plans for community engagement (for example, through community research and building community resilience). No other climate plans discuss the link to or impact of the climate crisis on primary care services or essential public health functions, or the potential contribution of community engagement to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
