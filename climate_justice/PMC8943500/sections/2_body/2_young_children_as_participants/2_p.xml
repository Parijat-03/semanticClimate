Sonter and Kemp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>) found that working with the UNSDGs may support educators to demonstrate quality practice in line with the national policy. As influencers of early childhood pedagogy, educators are the designers and presenters of a more holistic understanding of education towards societal and global sustainability who will inspire the hopeful, transformative change required in the learning spaces of early childhood. UNICEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>) links the UNSDGs to the Convention of the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). Park et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>) found that the health sector and education were most often linked when comparing the UNSDGs and the UNCRC. In 2019, 16 children filed a formal complaint to the Committee on the Rights of the child where they argued that their livelihood, and thus their rights, were endangered because five named nations did not take enough actions towards sustainability. In its response, the Office of the high commission for the human rights (OHCHR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>) acknowledges that climate change violates children&#8217;s rights to life, health, and culture. Children are given credit for their effort to bring these issues to the public knowledge and international jurisdiction. However, since the children had not followed a filing procedure in their own countries, the High commission did not go into the specific details of the complaint. The whole procedure shows that the SDGs are also influencing children&#8217;s priorities and perspectives and it is a good example of children&#8217;s agency.</p>
