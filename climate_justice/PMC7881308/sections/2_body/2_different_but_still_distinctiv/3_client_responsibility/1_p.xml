Working closely with their supervisor and clients, students have opportunities to develop their professional identity. The pandemic has curtailed opportunities for students and supervisors to work face to face with clients, necessitating a shift to remote service delivery, via telephone and digital platforms like Zoom. This is likely to require supervisors to take a more active role in directing the client interview and advice processes used in clinic work. The experience of the supervisor is likely to be important in ensuring that clients and students can engage in the advice process in ways that safeguard the security and confidentiality of all participants.</p>
