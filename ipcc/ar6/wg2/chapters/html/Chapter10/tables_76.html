Large cities are warmer by more\nthan 2&#176;C compared with the surroundings due to heat island effects, exacerbating heat stress conditions. Future\nwarming will cause more frequent temperature extremes and heatwaves especially in densely populated South\nAsian cities, where working conditions will be exacerbated and daytime outdoor work will become dangerous. For\nexample, incidence of excess heat-related mortality in 51 cities in China is estimated to reach 37,800 deaths per year</td>
