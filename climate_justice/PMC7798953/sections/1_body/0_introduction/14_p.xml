Shaw at the David J. Sencer <sc>Cdc</sc> Museum put it, &#8220;lays bare issues of health equity and health disparity&#8221; common to both. And it makes apparent the state-sponsored violence underlying both. Whereas many people have never thought much about medicine having a history&#8212;as Alexandra Lord, of the Division of Medicine and Science at the <sc>Nmah</sc>, points out&#8212;or being political, the pandemic has offered an education. It has brought into public view the cracks in our public health infrastructure, and its multigenerational and disproportionate effects on black people, indigenous groups, and other peoples of color&#8212;many also suffering from underlying health conditions born out of poverty and from living amid environmental and industrial pollution. For the same reasons, the pandemic has ravaged people in jails and prisons. The historical imperative to shine a light on these structural inequities is matched by the necessity to responsibly document and center the experiences of those who are most affected, and whose stories have not typically been valued or told.</p>
