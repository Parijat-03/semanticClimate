<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">With regard to pre-monsoon vegetation, vulnerable groups such as children, agricultural workers, and larger size households that face significantly higher heat exposure were found to reside in wards with a non-significant or negative relationship with the May NDVI. Economically affluent groups such as households with assets and those with electricity that indicated significantly lower heat exposure in May were found to reside in wards with significantly higher greenspace based on the NDVI. These results are consistent with a previous U.S. study in which socioeconomically advantaged groups had greater access to urban greenspaces [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is noteworthy that SCs, considered to be a socially vulnerable group, are linked to higher greenspace which could be related to their concentration in areas proximate to the Yamuna river. Households owning homes were significantly associated with lower greenspace in May, and this finding potentially reflects the absence of lower or moderate income residents in wards characterized by expensive rental housing and higher greenspace.</p>
