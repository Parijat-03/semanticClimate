The growth of precipitation intensity maxima was most evident in Yakutia for the 4 warm season (Khlebnikova et al., 2019b). The largest increase in precipitation was over the southern part of 5 Russian Far East mostly due to positive changes in convective precipitation intensity in the region that has 6 increased by over 1 mm per day per decade, implying a 13.8% increase per 1&#176;C warming over the 1966&#8211;7 2016 period (Chernokulsky et al., 2019). Other studies have shown this major role of convective 8 precipitation in the increase in precipitation intensity and extremes over Northern Eurasia (Ye et al., 2017a). 9 In the central part of Western Siberia, frozen precipitation and the frequency of freezing rain increased while 10 freezing drizzle frequency decreased over entire Russia (Groisman et al., 2016). Showery precipitation 11 dominates in Northern Eurasia over the 1966&#8211;2016 period (Chernokulsky et al., 2019) and the amount of 12 solid precipitation predominantly decreased. Total number of days without precipitation rose almost over the 13 whole territory in winter, and in summer in the Kamchatka Peninsula and Chukchi Peninsula (Frolov et al., 14 2014). Based on All-Russian Institute for Hydrometeorological Information data, over the 1966&#8211;2010 15 interval, the longest dry day periods (up to 14.6 days) were observed along the southern border of Siberia in 16 winter. Significant positive changes in consecutive dry days over the 1991&#8211;2015 period (relative to 1966&#8211;17 1990) were identified in the southern parts of Eastern Siberia and in most of the Russian Far East. At the 18 same time, the zone of significant negative changes was clearly pronounced in Eastern Siberia (Ye, 2018).  19 20 Figure Atlas.29: shows observations based on three datasets for annual mean temperature (a) and 21 precipitation (b) trends. Significant warming is evident in the northern regions of North Asia.

For seasonal values, ERA-Interim reanalysis data underestimate mean temperature over 28 North-East Asia in spring (MAM), autumn (SON), and winter (DJF) and overestimate it in summer (JJA). 29 The data set also underestimates summer (JJA) precipitation and shows large wet biases over North-East 30 Asia during spring compared with CRU dataset (Ozturk et al., 2017; Top et al., submitted).  31 32 In terms of the main synoptic processes affecting North Asia, GCMs are able to capture the temporal 33 evolution of the Siberian High (SH) over the historical 1872&#8211;2005 period for both magnitude and position. 34 On decadal and multi-decadal time scales, the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble also captures the pronounced 35 reduction (between the 1981&#8211;2000 and 1881&#8211;1900 periods) and the recovery (during the 1991&#8211;2005 period) 36 of the SH intensity (Fei and Yong-Qi, 2015). Both CMIP3 and CMIP5 indicate a weakening of intensity of 37 the winter SH and a strengthening of the interannual variability compared to the historical period (Lupo and 38 Kininmonth, 2013; Fei and Yong-Qi, 2015). The main blocking characteristics of the current climate 39 obtained from reanalysis data, including number of blocking events and their duration, intensity and 40 frequency in the region was reasonably well reproduced by GCMs (Mokhov et al., 2014). However, GCMs 41 do not sufficiently simulate the Northern Hemisphere Eurasian warming pattern (Lupo and Kininmonth, 42 2013) and most of the GCMs overestimate the annual mean temperature over Northern Eurasia (</span><span style="x0: 481.26; x1: 486.75; y0: 240.53; y1: 251.51; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="481.26" y0="240.53" x1="503.63">high </span><span x0="27.66" y0="240.53" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 240.53; y1: 251.51; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">43 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 61.58; y0: 227.87; y1: 238.85; width: 4.87; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="227.87" x1="107.99">confidence)</span><span x0="108.0" y0="227.87" x1="41.45" style="x0: 108.0; x1: 110.75; y0: 227.87; y1: 238.85; width: 2.74; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Generally, the bias in the simulated annual surface air temperature simulation primarily comes 44 from winter (DJF) season, while the model biases in other seasons are relatively smaller (Miao et al., 2014; 45 Peng et al., 2019). Most of the GCMs can approximate the decadal SAT trend, but the accuracy of annual 46 SAT simulation is relatively low (Miao et al., 2014). Moreover CMIP5 GCMs fail to capture the decreasing 47 temperature trend over East Siberia (Fei and Yong-Qi, 2015). For CMIP5, models with higher resolution do 48 not always perform better than those with lower resolutions (Miao et al., 2014). 49 50 The performance of 16 CMIP5 models in simulating SAT variability over Eurasia in the 20th century was 51 evaluated with respect to CRU observations for permafrost subregions (Peng et al., 2019). Results show 52 warm bias in the northwest of Eurasia when both CMIP5 ensemble averages and CRU observations 53 demonstrate climate warming over the 20th century, with acceleration during the late 20th century. Further, 54 CMIP5 GCMs generally underestimate daily temperature range (DTR) compared with observations over 55 </span></div></body></html>
