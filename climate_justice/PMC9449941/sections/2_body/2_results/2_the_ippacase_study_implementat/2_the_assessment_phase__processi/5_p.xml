From an institutional economics perspective, analyses were carried out for researching capacity allocation options for integrating electro mobility into the electricity system (no. 10), and for researching various management models for implementing fast-charging electric vehicle infrastructure (no. 11). In addition, law analysis assessed the legal framework and problems for charging infrastructure (no. 12). From a techno-economic optimization approach, using the REMod simulation tool (no. 13), the effectiveness of intelligent charging stations use was analysed, and whether grid-supported charging and discharging of battery electric cars has an impact on their use in the vehicle fleet.</p>
