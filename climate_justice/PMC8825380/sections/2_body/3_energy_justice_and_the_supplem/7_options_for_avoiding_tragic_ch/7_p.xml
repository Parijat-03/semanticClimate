It is highly more efficient in HDI terms to allow increased energy use for those at very low rates of GJ per capita (Steinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>). Moreover, rejecting policies to lower the GJ per capita of those well-off would entail either sacrificing the economic development and increased well-being of poor nations, or allowing such development but at the expense of exposing future generations to increased risk. The fairness of maintaining &#8216;the accustomed affluence&#8217; of rich nations is highly questionable (Shue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]: 66). An alternative, suggested in Scenario III, is that high GJ per capita is maintained with significant, possibly unprecedented (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>), development of renewable technologies to decarbonize. An alternative, carrying other risks, is the use of nuclear power. For reasons of space we will not further discuss that alternative.</p>
