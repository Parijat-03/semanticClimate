Janes and Sandell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) write about &#8220;new and divergent expressions of the museum&#8217;s inherent power as a force for good&#8221; (p. 1), as a catalyst for change. In a time of, for example, COVID-19, environmental degradation, advances in reproductive technologies, waste management issues, oil extraction, and global warming, science museums can become another player and voice for social, environmental, and political transformation (Janes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Ng&#160;et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>).</p>
