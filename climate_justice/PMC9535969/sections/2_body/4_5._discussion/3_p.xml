<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our research design was an explicit attempt to &#8216;politicize&#8217; public engagement with geoengineering, in light of social sciences&#8217; concerns with some of the most controversial applications, such as SAI (<xref rid="bibr29-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Szerszynski et al., 2013</xref>). In that sense, the way we conceived the &#8216;politics&#8217; of geoengineering was also informed by our own situatedness as &#8216;critical&#8217; social scientists. The set of materials supporting the FGs, as well as our interventions, confirms the critique of <xref rid="bibr16-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Heyward and Rayner (2015)</xref>, since social scientists are often more concerned with the sociopolitical impacts of &#8216;technofixes&#8217; than with top-down climate politics. Our situatedness was also mirrored by the focus groups&#8217; participants as in most groups a wide array of sociopolitical solutions &#8211; at the individual, local, national and global levels &#8211; were often preferred to the more controversial geoengineering applications that often became the synonym of geoengineering. In fact, although proposals such as afforestation are often understood as forms of geoengineering, our presentation and discussion highlighted the most spectacular ones, inevitably framing geoengineering as a &#8216;technofix&#8217;.</p>
