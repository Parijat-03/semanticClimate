<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par9">There is still no agreed definition of climate finance, even after a quarter century of negotiations. So each developed country can decide what it counts as such, why, and whether it can be considered as &#8220;new and additional&#8221; (Weikmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2017</xref>). This contributes to widely differing estimates by agencies, for example, of the Fast Start Finance of $30 billion, pledged at Copenhagen in 2009 as immediate delivery during 2010-2012, between 05 and 30% went to adaptation (Nakhooda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>; Buchner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). What is more disquieting is that the overwhelming share of climate finance (76-80%) is recycled official development assistance (ODA) (Oxfam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2012</xref>; Nakhooda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>). But under the regime provisions, climate finance is agreed to be different, as &#8220;new and additional&#8221; (Article 4.3 of the Convention). The UNEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>) estimates that by 2030 up to $300 billion a year will be needed to address climate impacts. The Paris Agreement stipulates for a new global goal of fund mobilization by 2025, keeping the $100bn pledged at Copenhagen as the floor (which was supposed to be reached by 2020).</p>
