Starting in the mid-twentieth century, sociological studies have documented the complicated relationship between participation and public policy (Moynihan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1969</xref>; Selznick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1953</xref>). More recent research is even more cynical, as scholars have documented how city officials can design public forums to elicit participation from the public in ways designed to decouple deliberation from decision-making power. While participatory technologies were once &#8220;used to challenge the authority of urban elites,&#8221; Walker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2015</xref>)&#160;explain, &#8220;they are now a central component of that authority.&#8221;</p>
