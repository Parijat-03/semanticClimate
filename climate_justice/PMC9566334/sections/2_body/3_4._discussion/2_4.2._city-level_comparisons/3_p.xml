<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Notable among the Hispanic rankings is there are only five cities west of the Mississippi River: four in California, one in Texas in the top 25. Most of the remaining cities are within the Midwest and east coast of the US. Based on this observation, Hispanic populations east of the Mississippi River are exposed to higher SUHI intensities than in the Western U.S., at least within the top 25 cities. Notably missing in the rankings for Hispanic exposure is Phoenix, AZ, which has a high degree of heat-related issues every year and a large Hispanic population. The likely reason for the absence of Phoenix among this ranking is the listing is not based on absolute SUHI temperature but on SUHI temperature differential (intensity) relative to the surrounding environment. The UHI in Phoenix does not show the same degree of intensity during the daytime, compared to the background temperature, as heat islands in the Midwest or US east coast and south due to the paucity of significant surrounding vegetation [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The more arid, less vegetated surrounding land cover contains components that also absorb energy, thereby creating a less drastic temperature differential relative to urban heat islands in the eastern U.S. [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This could also help explain the number of cities east of the Mississippi River in the overall rankings since these are likely to have more significant amounts of vegetation in the background environment leading to higher SUHI intensity measurements.</p>
