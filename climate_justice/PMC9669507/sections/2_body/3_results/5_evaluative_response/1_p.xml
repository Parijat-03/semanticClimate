<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This theme encompasses all the remaining comments consisting of supportive and
critical responses resulting from evaluating the models. Supportive comments
were grouped into three subthemes: <italic toggle="yes">supporting predictive journalism,
model enhancements</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">illustrating modeling
principles</italic>. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">Critical Comments</italic> were
criticizing the models and the way models were visualized and presented
(<italic toggle="yes">visualizations</italic>). Throughout the thematic analysis, we also
found a few instances of critical comments being directed toward other entities
(e.g. <italic toggle="yes">healthcare system</italic>), and actors (e.g.
<italic toggle="yes">government</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">public, and
journalists</italic>).</p>
