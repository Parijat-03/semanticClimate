A variation on this argument about the social production of an accepted truth can be found in Navon and Eyal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>), who propose that there are &#8220;networks of actors, devices, concepts, and institutional, discursive, and spatial arrangements that give the statement the value of truth&#8212;that make it thinkable, defensible, and actionable.&#8221;</p>
