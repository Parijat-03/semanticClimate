The attempt to marginalize agrarian movement voices championing agroecology and food sovereignty emerged from the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996, when the leader of the international peasant movement, La V&#237;a Campesina (LVC), critiqued transnational agribusiness claims to feed the world with standardized high-tech &#8216;agriculture without farmers&#8217;. In 2002, La V&#237;a Campesina (LVC) joined 51 other civil society organizations to form the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC), resolving to gain a presence in the UN&#8217;s Committee on Food Security (CFS). This materialized in CFS reform, with admission of the Civil Society Mechanism (CSM&#8212;now the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples Mechanism) and a Private Sector Mechanism (PSM) in 2010, following the 2007&#8211;08 &#8216;food crisis&#8217; which had called CFS food security governance into question.</p>
