These are groups of community members convened by city governments to facilitate the planning, implementation, and/or evaluation of just climate policies. Equity advisory boards are usually organised into one or more committees, subcommittees, or working groups and are granted varying levels of involvement throughout the policy process. In general, however, these boards are tasked with representing and engaging vulnerable populations, proposing justice centred policy objectives and actions, and reviewing policies and programs to ensure they are aligned with justice goals. In some cases, equity advisory boards are also responsible for developing equity tools themselves. Although the members of these boards are not explicitly listed in all climate action plans, we found that these groups are commonly comprised by residents, advocates, academics, representatives from the private sector, and government officials.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Overview of equity advisory boards</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>City</th><th>Name of body</th><th>Policy stage</th><th>Members identified in climate plan</th><th>Main tasks and responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anchorage, AK</td><td><p>(a) Steering Committee</p><p>(b) Advisory Committee</p><p>(c) Working Group</p></td><td>Design, implementation, and evaluation</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups, academics, private sector, government officials.</td><td><p>(a) Community engagement and design of Equity Implementation Guide.</p><p>(b) Review of plan drafts, equity-centred policy advice, implementation assistance.</p><p>(c) Crafting equity-centred policy objectives and actions.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Atlanta, GA</td><td>Advisory Group</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups, private sector.</td><td>Crating policy goals, policy implementation advice, policy analysis and review.</td></tr><tr><td>Baltimore, MD</td><td>Sustainability Ambassadors</td><td>Design</td><td>Community members</td><td>Community representation and engagement.</td></tr><tr><td>Boston, MA</td><td>Community Working Group</td><td>Design</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups, academics, private sector, government officials.</td><td>Policy design and advice.</td></tr><tr><td>Charlotte, NC*</td><td>Workforce Development Working Group</td><td>Design</td><td>Advocacy groups, academics, private sector, government officials.</td><td>Ensuring equitable access and distribution of jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>Cleveland, OH</td><td>Equity and Engagement Subcommittee</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Advocacy groups, academics, private sector, government officials.</td><td>Design of Racial Equity Tool.</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas, TX</td><td>Environment and Sustainability Committee</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Government officials</td><td>Policy design, policy implementation guidance and assistance.</td></tr><tr><td>Los Angeles, CA</td><td>Climate Emergency Commission</td><td>Implementation</td><td>Community members, private sector, government officials</td><td>Community representation and engagement during implementation.</td></tr><tr><td>Minneapolis, MN</td><td><p>(a) Environmental Justice Working Group</p><p>(b) Community Environmental Advisory Commission</p></td><td>Design and evaluation</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups, academics, government officials</td><td><p>(a) Community representation, policy design and advice, policy review.</p><p>(b) Plan revision.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Oakland, CA</td><td><p>(a) Ad hoc Advisory Committee</p><p>(b) Equity Facilitator</p><p>(c) Neighbourhood Leadership Cohort</p></td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups</td><td><p>(a) Review of plan drafts, policy advise.</p><p>(b) Community engagement, policy review, and design of the Racial equity impact assessment and implementation guide.</p><p>(c) Community engagement.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Portland, OR</td><td>Equity Working Group</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Advocacy groups</td><td>Policy design and advice, design of Equity implementation guide.</td></tr><tr><td>San Diego, CA</td><td>Equity Stakeholder Working Group</td><td>Design and evaluation</td><td>Advocacy groups</td><td>Policy design and advice, design of the Climate Equity Index.</td></tr><tr><td>San Antonio, TX</td><td>Climate Equity Advisory Committee</td><td>Implementation</td><td>Community members, advocacy groups</td><td>Community representation, implementation guidance and assistance.</td></tr><tr><td>St, Louis, MO</td><td>Climate Action Planning Equity Advisory Committee</td><td>Evaluation</td><td>Not stated in the plan</td><td>Measurement of policy impacts.</td></tr><tr><td>St. Paul, MN</td><td>Advisory Group</td><td>Implementation</td><td>Community members</td><td>Policy implementation guidance and&#160;assistance.</td></tr><tr><td>Washington, DC</td><td>Equity Advisory Group</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Community members</td><td>Community representation and engagement, policy design, implementation guidance and assistance.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>*</sup>This equity body is only focused on workforce development policies.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
