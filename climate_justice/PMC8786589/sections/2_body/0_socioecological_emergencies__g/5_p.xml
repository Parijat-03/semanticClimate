The environmental governance field represents a good example where Eurocentric ideas of environment and nature are exclusively used as a basis for designing global policy problems and solutions, dismissing indigenous knowledge systems as subjective and/or situated cultural knowledge (Biermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Rodr&#237;guez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>). The EU has a multitude of environmental policies with direct and indirect implications for the Global South, where issues such as global deforestation, climate change and biodiversity are tackled. The EU bioeconomy policy is one of the EU policies which, even if not directly implemented or imposed on Global South countries, has direct impacts on them owing to the EU&#8217;s role in imports and trade as well as corporate investments in developing the green economy in those countries (Fuchs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>; Hickel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>; Zografos and Robins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2020</xref>).</p>
