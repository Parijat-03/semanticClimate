While these non-hierarchal power structures are an established advantage of movements, giving them the flexibility, dynamism and resistance to repression, reliance on adhocracy may not produce democratic socialisation. In the context of virtual collective spaces afforded by internet technologies, adhocracy, through decentralised electronic and online methods of collective action, tends to situate issues and problems in the context of &#8220;unique&#8221; or unusual issues that may require extra-normal methods to address. These types of organisational forms place politics into states of exception where the framing of the problem as exceptional encourages solutions based on the sovereign&#8217;s ability to transcend the rule of law in the name of the &#8220;public good&#8221; (Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1922</xref>). Therefore, they are less, not more, likely to consider democratic norms and suffer from low accountability and less-drawing potential. While these forms of governance can ameliorate the crises, the longer-term governance legitimated by invoking sovereign power is problematic under this model (see Wallach&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2015</xref>) discussion of advocacy and the global financial crisis). While the lack of lesson-drawing limits the &#8220;developmental&#8221; value of participation in these forms of governance structure, this critique is emerging in response to state responses to the Covid-19 crisis of 2020.</p>
