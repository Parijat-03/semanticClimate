<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Currently, planetary health research is not a primary research focus within the medical school, and the university lacks an institute solely dedicated to planetary health research. Although there are no researchers with a primary focus on planetary health within the SMDBS, many researchers at Queen&#8217;s are working on this, and the establishment of the Centre of Sustainability, Equality and Climate Change proves that planetary health research is becoming an area of expertise and importance within the wider university. Establishment of this centre offers many opportunities for interdisciplinary research and climate action in the coming years. The success of the conference entitled &#8220;Healthy People on a Healthy Planet&#8221;, which involved several staff members from the school and others at QUB has further highlighted the need for environmentalism within medicine and should encourage similar events to take place in the future.</p>
