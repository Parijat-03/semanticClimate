Lucas-Picher et&#160;al. (2017) find indirect evidence via precipitation patterns that 12 km simulations further improve the representation. Soares et&#160;al. (2014) demonstrated that an 8 km resolution RCM simulated a&#160;realistic three-dimensional structure of the Iberian coastal low-level jet, and the surface winds compare well with observations. Lucas-Picher et&#160;al. (2017) showed that a&#160;0.44&#176; resolution RCM underestimated winds along the Canadian east coast, whereas a&#160;0.11&#176; resolution version simulated more realistic 10 metre wind speed. Also, the Etesian winds in the Aegean Sea were realistically simulated by 12 km resolution RCMs (Dafka et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.81" top="558.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="558.6" x1="298.81" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 558.6; y1: 568.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A particularly relevant coastal phenomenon is the sea breeze, which is caused by the differential heating of water and land during the diurnal cycle and typically reaches several tens of kilometres inland. Reanalyses and global models have too coarse a&#160;resolution to realistically represent this phenomenon, such that they typically underestimate precipitation over islands and misrepresent its diurnal cycle (Lucas-Picher et&#160;al., 2017). RCMs improve the representation of sea breezes and thereby precipitation in coastal areas and islands. Over Cuba and Florida only a&#160;12 km-resolution RCM is able to realistically simulate the inland propagation of precipitation during the course of the day (Lucas-Picher et&#160;al., 2017). RCM simulations at 20 km horizontal resolution realistically represented the sea breeze circulation in the Mediterranean Gulf of Lions including the intensity, direction and inward propagation (Drobinski et&#160;al., 2018). Even though a&#160;coupled ocean&#8211;atmosphere simulation improved the representation of diurnal SST variations, the sea breeze representation itself was not improved.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.77" top="342.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="342.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.67; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Big lakes modify the downwind climate. In particular during winter they are relatively warm compared to the surrounding land, provide moisture, destabilize the passing air column and produce convective systems. The increase in friction when moving air reaches land causes convergence and uplift, and may trigger precipitation. Gula and Peltier (2012) found that a&#160;state-of-the-art GCM does not realistically simulate these effects over the North American Great Lakes, but a&#160;10&#160;km RCM better represents them and thereby simulates realistic downwind precipitation patterns, in particular enhanced snowfall during the winter season. Similar results were found by Wright et&#160;al. (2013), Notaro et&#160;al. (2015) and Lucas-Picher et&#160;al. (2017). In a&#160;convection permitting simulation of the Lake Victoria region, a&#160;too strong nocturnal land breeze resulted in unrealistically high precipitation (Finney et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="81.49" top="162.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="162.6" x1="81.49" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 82.36; x1: 86.94; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="82.36" y0="162.6" x1="142.51">high confidence </span><span x0="143.38" y0="162.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 143.38; x1: 146.2; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that climate models with sufficiently high resolution are necessary for realistically simulating lake and coastal weather including coastal low-level jets, lake and sea breezes, as well as lake effects on rainfall and snow.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="102.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="102.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In regions like Fenno-Scandinavia or central-eastern Canada, very large fractions of land are covered by small and medium sized lakes.

In particular cold fronts are regions of relatively strong uplift and hence often associated with severe weather (e.g.,&#160;Schemm et&#160;al., 2016). Stationary or slowly moving fronts may cause extended heavy precipitation. The evaluation of how climate models represent fronts, however, remains limited. Catto et&#160;al. (2014) found in both ERA-Interim and CMIP5 models that frontal frequency and strength were realistically simulated, albeit with some biases in the location. Follow-up investigations, for boreal and austral winter (Catto et&#160;al., 2015) found frontal precipitation frequency to be too high and the intensity too low, but these compensating biases resulted in only a&#160;small total precipitation bias. Bl&#225;zquez and Solman (2018) found similar results for Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter, and also showed that CMIP5 models typically overestimate the fraction of frontal precipitation compared to total precipitation. As for the reference, the ERA-Interim reanalysis misrepresents conditional symmetric instability associated with fronts, and the corresponding precipitation (Glinton et&#160;al., 2017). Only a&#160;few studies evaluating fronts in RCMs have been conducted. Kawazoe and Gutowski (2013) diagnosed strong temperature gradients associated with extreme winter precipitation in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) RCM ensemble (Mearns et&#160;al., 2012) and found the models agreed well with gradients in a&#160;reanalysis. De Jesus et&#160;al. (2016) diagnosed the representations of cold fronts over southern Brazil in two RCMs, finding that they were only underestimated by about 5% across the year, but in one RCM, summer cold fronts were underestimated by 17%. An RCM-based reanalysis suggests that high-resolution RCM simulations improve the representation of orographic influences on fronts (Jenkner et&#160;al.,&#160;2009).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="526.1" top="126.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="126.48" x1="526.1" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 126.48; y1: 136.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.3.5 Performance at Simulating Regional Feedbacks</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="102.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="102.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.19; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Both SRCCL (Jia et&#160;al., 2019) and SROCC (Hock et&#160;al., 2019) highlight the weaknesses of climate models at simulating atmosphere&#8211;surface feedbacks.
