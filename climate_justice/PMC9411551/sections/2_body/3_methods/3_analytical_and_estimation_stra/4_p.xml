The error term (<italic>&#949;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) is assumed to be independently and identically distributed, but there still could be collinearities among parcels within a census tract. We, therefore, cluster the standard errors at the census tract (<italic>c</italic>) level to account for any unmeasured similarity that these within-tract parcels may have compared to parcels elsewhere in the county.</p>
