<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">I was also involved in collecting around the events of September 11, 2001&#8212;an extraordinarily complicated project in that it had a public side and a hidden side. A huge dispute occurred within the museum about whether we should, in fact, collect anything. There were basically three camps. One was the people who said we should have a <sc>Swat</sc> team and immediately go in and do some collecting. Another large contingent was just horrified by the fact that a museum would take on a collection related to such an act because museums generally don't preserve acts of violence. And there was a large group of people who thought that museums should collect as they do with anything&#8212;wait twenty or thirty years. People will preserve things and we'll collect it from them in time.</p>
