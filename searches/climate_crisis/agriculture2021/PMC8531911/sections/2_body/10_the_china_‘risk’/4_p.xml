But WTO rules were not written in the early 1990s with China in mind, and the WTO was criticized for failing &#8216;to adequately police Beijing for using a mix of private enterprise and state support to dominate global industries&#8217; (Swanson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>). As a member of the US Council of Foreign Relations commented: &#8216;China is no longer seen as on a trajectory that favours the US&#8217; (Farrer and Kuo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>). After the 2008 world financial crisis, when China, with its substantial financial reserves, created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), US Presidential economic advisor Lawrence Summers declared this &#8216;the moment the United States lost its role as underwriter of the global economic system&#8217; (Weisman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>). Since the crisis, the US &#8216;share of global economic power fell from 50% to just 15% in 2017&#8217; (McCoy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>).
