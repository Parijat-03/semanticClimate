[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:15:06
I know, but it gives me a different menu when I'm sharing the screen. We'll come to that in a minute anyway, captions and Beautiful transcript.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:15:09
And now I'm going to release the screen. Oh yeah. Okay. So, Renu, can you tell us?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:15:21
Exactly what you did. So, what is a good time to start from?

[Renu Kumari] 10:15:29
So I'm sharing the screen now

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:15:31
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:15:37
And again, rate like I have read this to put the transcript here like put these into the new discussion.

[Renu Kumari] 10:15:50
So I went there.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:15:53
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:15:56
So I try to create the discussion as my good having closed so I created the new discussion. In the general category.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:04
No, was it so? What when was it 1st closed? Today? Right, okay.

[Renu Kumari] 10:16:12
It's a today today. Today morning I tried to post the like.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:17
So, so you went to GitHub to post this into the discussion. And it, and Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:16:23
Of the 70 climate repository.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:27
And. You got that screen, is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:16:31
Yes. Currently it is not showing the new button, new discussion, open new discussion. But.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:32
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:37
No, but but let's try and take this. Step by step. So you took the you took a piece of text, right, which is quite large.

[Renu Kumari] 10:16:43
Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:16:51
No, I not taken the sort of quite large text I have copied all the text in the transfer that so maybe that also

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:16:57
Yeah copied the text in the transcript, right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:01
Hmm. So this was the, this unit. I'll show you the. It takes to formatted session.

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:09
Sorry.

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:11
So this was the test. So I, This call I copied. Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:13
You took this text, right? Okay. So it's a text file.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:21
And. You posted that. Into an existing GitHub discussion or a new discussion.

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:29
No, it's new discussion. It's a discussion slash 12 number discussion.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:33
You open?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:36
So be very, very clear. You opened a new discussion, is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:43
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:44
What was it called?

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:46
So I give the title session one. Underscore 11 June underscore for formatted transcript.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:50
Brian?

[Renu Kumari] 10:17:58
That was a title and then in this. Body part like whatever it is called and then lower substance sections.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:17:59
Yeah. Okay.

[Renu Kumari] 10:18:07
I base the whole. Translate text. And submitted it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:13
Right. Hey, you submitted it and immediately you got the screen. Is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:18:20
Okay, yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:22
Alright, so let's be very clear about this. You took a piece of text. Which was, a text file.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:31
Which we had, created together. As a community, you posted it into a new discussion on GitHub and immediately, your account was suspended.

[Renu Kumari] 10:18:37
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:18:45
Hmm. They got this messes. What was that? This mass is account suspended.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:46
Is that right?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:51
Well.

[Renu Kumari] 10:18:52
Access to your account has been suspended due to violation of our terms of services. So I. Then I click on the contact support.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:18:56
Okay. Right.

[Renu Kumari] 10:19:02
And So it will give me the So. Then sign up, Okay. I did that. Shows me like this so I have not tried to do here and then I found, from the internet, or try to do here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:19:02
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:19:08
Right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:19:25
And then I found from the internet, the support dot email, like from chat, GPT, I got Okay.

[Renu Kumari] 10:19:27
I got to support support at the rate github.com. So there.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:19:30
Yes. And when did you mail them?

[Renu Kumari] 10:19:35
It's not there. Just a minute. I mailed today morning.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:19:42
Yes. Okay, you've done exactly right. What I would say is, The. Clear and more structured your mail to them is.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:19:58
You know, the, the more, likely, they are to reply and so on.

[Renu Kumari] 10:20:07
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:20:08
Okay. So 1st of all, at my. Simpy, right? It's traumatic when something like this happens.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:20:19
You're behaving responsibly. And you are accused of malpractice. And I don't believe that you could possibly have done anything which merits.

[Renu Kumari] 10:20:25
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:20:31
Malpractice. I'm going to hypothesize now. The possible hypotheses are A that they thought this was serious copyright violation.

[Renu Kumari] 10:20:32
Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:20:50
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:20:51
There is no, there is no copyright violation because it's actually, my speech and unless They have actually felt that it was inappropriate for you to publish this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:21:03
Which is possible. Then, Then, I don't think it's copyright very nice.

[Renu Kumari] 10:21:03
Hmm. Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:21:16
We did not quote anybody in this. There is nothing where they can say you have violated, Disney's copyright or whomever it might be.

[Renu Kumari] 10:21:26
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:21:26
So, the second possibility is it contains dialogue. Which is unacceptable to, the GitHub principles.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:21:41
Now, we have not discussed anything, I believe, which is inappropriate. We should Look through.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:21:51
And one of the difficult things, where machines fail, is that if you are talking about something, then the machine may mistake it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:22:05
So if it's reported dialogue. Then you know it is possible, that it's not regarded as reported dialogue but as actual dialogue.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:22:18
So if I. For example, quote somebody. As coming up with something which is.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:22:29
Unacceptable for all sorts of reasons whether it might be hate speech or sexual inappropriateness or whatever, then It's.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:22:43
And this is frequent. This is one reason why automated filters are a very bad idea.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:22:50
Because people cannot design automatic filters which are as good as humans, right? So it's possible that something in the content upset them.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:23:02
Copyright or inappropriate content. The 3rd is that it might violate some practice which was not allowed so it could be that it was too big or it was too frequent.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:23:19
Or that there was an intention. To. An intention to, in some way.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:23:31
Cause problems, to the site. So, you know, might be seen as a denial of service attack or something of that sort.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:23:42
So all of these are possibilities. Too big, too frequent. something of that sort.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:23:53
Then it's a possibility that your email has been confused with somebody else. Right. Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:24:02
Do you have more than one GitHub account?

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:05
No, I have only one but I created another one today.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:24:10
Right. Okay. That's And what did they do about that? Hey, Is that, where you.

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:12
That this happens. Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:19
Okay, so another invite is with the semantic climate and one is with my, personal account like the email account.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:24:26
Right, so you've got a personal one. Have you had any response from GitHub on that?

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:27
And I think.

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:32
Yes, on the 1st one, the personal one, which I was using earlier. So they have send me the ticket ID for the complaint ticket number.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:24:42
Oh, you've got a ticket number. Okay, can you show us this ticket number?

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:44
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:24:50
Yes, I can share it.

[Renu Kumari] 10:25:45
So. Yeah, and share the screen.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:25:50
Yeah.

[Renu Kumari] 10:25:52
Hmm. Good. So they have given me some ticket number this.

[Renu Kumari] 10:26:05
Okay

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:26:17
Right, it may be worth

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:26:24
Yes, it It may, now 1st will renew. I think you should not do any of this because you don't want to be.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:26:36
Cut off github again and you don't want the automated system to think that you know you are in some way an irresponsible user right okay I'm also a little bit,

[Renu Kumari] 10:26:47
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:26:53
Reluctant to do it myself because All of our code is in my repositories. And if they ban me.

[Renu Kumari] 10:27:00
And the website is also we are running the semantic climate website whatever we are updating it through the

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:01
Then we've got

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:08
Yes. So.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:13
Have they have they banned the semantic climate site then?

[Renu Kumari] 10:27:19
No.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:20
They band, flower, whatever, but not semantic climate, right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:27:28
There's, there's no data ID for the semantic climate. I think the website, yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:31
There isn't. Okay, fine. Right. Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:36
Right.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:39
So you'll see that I am. 1st of all, I'm not panicking, right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:27:47
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:48
Second day I'm giving you reassurance.

[Renu Kumari] 10:27:51
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:27:52
Right, so you've done nothing wrong. you may have,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:02
Overstep something. Without. You know, totally accidentally or it may be that they're software, has inappropriateately banned you.

[Renu Kumari] 10:28:14
So now what the other people will do with the are they going to do this? Both the sense, other things like similar to our what should they avoid.

[Renu Kumari] 10:28:23
To profit not facing the situations again.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:27
Well. 1st of all,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:35
So I'm thinking. I will ask my associates about this because they will know this, right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:28:44
Hmm

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:45
And. We have.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:51
We should be careful what we post to GitHub. Because we don't want to get cut off.

[Renu Kumari] 10:28:54
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:28:59
My guess is that this is a that this is related to your account rather than the content. But, let me read to the content quickly.

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:08
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:11
Is the content on Slack?

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:12
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:14
Right, okay. So,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:22
Let me go to our slack. This is, you know, absolutely. Textbook illustration as to why knowledge.

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:25
Thank you.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:34
And Management by Closed or but, so is it in coordination, is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:35
So maybe copyright issue. Copyright issue may be there

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:45
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:48
Right.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:29:52
Is it this one? Yeah, I will share your screen.

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:55
You can share the screen.

[Renu Kumari] 10:29:58
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:30:17
Okay, so is it this one?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:30:24
Sorry. This one here. Right. Okay, so.

[Renu Kumari] 10:30:26
Yes, this one. This article is.

[Renu Kumari] 10:30:30
Celebrate the. Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:30:36
I think I have no option but to have to no, but I'm going to read it here.

[Renu Kumari] 10:30:39
You can download this.

[Renu Kumari] 10:30:44
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:30:44
Now

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:31:16
Right, this isn't today's monologue, it's yesterday's, is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:31:21
It's from the 11.th

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:31:23
I'm near them, okay, right.

[Renu Kumari] 10:31:24
The day before.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:09
Right. That's the complete thing. 71 lines, is that right?

[Renu Kumari] 10:33:15
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:18
Oh, it's just truncated for display.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:27
No, it's the same links, okay. Okay. So. Reno, I can't see anything in that which would trigger some violation of the guidelines.

[Renu Kumari] 10:33:28
Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:33:42
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:43
I am.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:47
I

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:33:52
I'm trying to get through my mind as to why somebody's account would be closed. And.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:01
Another one is. And. National security. So if You are from.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:10
The certain countries which are called the axis of evil by the united states and they are Iran, North Korea, Cuba and some where else I forget.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:22
If you are from any of those places, then, If you post things, they may be seen as of, a violation.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:34
A violation of security. These countries are not allowed to use US software, for example. But I don't think there's anything in that.

[Renu Kumari] 10:34:41
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:46
And I don't think you're, you know, you're likely to be,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:52
Identified. As.

[Renu Kumari] 10:34:55
So I have to write it in a descriptive email to them. What is step by step? So what I wanted to do and what I did and what I got it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:34:59
Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

[Renu Kumari] 10:35:05
That is the reason. Yeah, yeah, I'll do this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:06
Yes. You don't need to take more than a line or 2 about it. Just we will do this together.

[Renu Kumari] 10:35:12
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:15
So, okay, let's, let's dictate this. at the moment.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:24
So

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:28
I am manager of a community projects run between the yeah k and india make that india and uk where we collect How public knowledge and make it semantic.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:47
We use GitHub both for our code. And for don't.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:35:56
Our documents are created by us. And we will How, these under a.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:36:09
Okay, under an open license, allowing, a redistribution, there is no known copyright violation in what we do.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:36:22
We do not include, any, unacceptable language such as No, start again.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:36:37
I am project manager of a, India, UK. Collaboration on software development.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:36:47
And documents. We use GitHub to manage our code. And our documents and we have

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:36:57
Over 50 users, over a hundred users. Who have been using GitHub for many years.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:37:07
Most of us at least 4. Just for many years. We always

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:37:19
Today, give the date and time where you can. We uploaded a document, of our own creation to get hub discussions.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:37:32
And were met with I. Notice in forming us that we had been. That the account had been suspended.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:37:47
We Do not believe we have violated any terms and conditions of GitHub. And we asked to be.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:37:58
Reconnected immediately. And to be. Assured that this will not happen again.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:07
I think that's probably good enough. Okay. Draft it out. And,

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:10
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:13
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:18
Yeah, draft it out and then come to me and I will also sign it.

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:22
Okay. Okay. Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:28
Good. Have you mailed their support?

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:33
We had just. Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:34
You've got you've got a ticket. What did you put on your ticket?

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:39
I have to reinstate the word was there in the.

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:45
Okay, Yes. Hmm. Yes, we are that we I am Renu Kumari and this my account has been suspended today.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:46
You ask for reinstatement. That's good. Was it just a single sentence?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:38:57
Yep. That's an excellent message, right? Excellent. Okay, I would probably, since you've said that and it's very clear.

[Renu Kumari] 10:38:57
So please reinstate this account. That's the.

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:03
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:39:10
And you might have been, suspended for some other reason. We don't know.

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:16
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:39:17
So it's, it's probably not a good idea. To send anything more. On that ticket.

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:21
Yes, because, I send, another email that, another account I created and then, Maybe it is capturing our IP address or whatever it is the same browser.

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:34
So, do you mean saying that this is a duplicate, complaint?

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:43
So they are not raised any other ticket.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:39:43
Right. Right, so you've. So this will probably, the ticket will only be with one account, I would think.

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:54
Yes, one account.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:39:56
Is it with the, is it with the flower account?

[Renu Kumari] 10:39:58
Yes, this is for the flower. But I don't know how they capture the same information.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:40:00
Okay, continue on that. We'll see what happens.

[Renu Kumari] 10:40:05
Yeah, maybe we'll wait for a 1 day and then after that time. Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:40:07
I think you've got to wait. they do say that they are, understaffed at the moment.

[Renu Kumari] 10:40:16
Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:40:21
We will wait and then reply more from on Monday. Maybe I'll do Monday with reference to the ticket.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:40:25
I think that's that's a good idea. Now, Is this somebody here?

[Renu Kumari] 10:40:29
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:40:35
So I've said why I don't want to do it. Could somebody else volunteer, to post this to a discussion and see whether it's the content that is the problem or whether it's the use as the problem.

[Renu Kumari] 10:40:49
So their account is, if they're account, So how they are going to handle it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:40:58
No, what I mean is flower has been suspended and your prior, your other accounts has been suspended.

[Renu Kumari] 10:41:08
Account also. The Renu Kumari, 24 I created the new, user account with the semantic climate.

[Renu Kumari] 10:41:14
Gmail.com.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:41:16
Right, okay. So. We're really looking for a volunteer.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:41:29
To carry this out. I'm also thinking about whether we should move this. Oh,

[Renu Kumari] 10:41:40
We should wait. I think we should wait and then because other accounts will be seized again and then. They have to replace the problem.

[Renu Kumari] 10:41:48
Because we are working on the Yeah.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:41:51
Yes. We may need to move to get,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:02
We may need to move to get lab. Gitlab is much smaller, but it is, And.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:12
It's open.

[Renu Kumari] 10:42:15
Hmm. So, so, IS, GitHub is not open.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:19
It's run by, a Mega Corporation.

[Renu Kumari] 10:42:24
Hi, I thought it is open. Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:25
No, the contents are Open. But not this software and not the control.

[Renu Kumari] 10:42:31
Hmm. Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:42:37
Okay. Okay, then we can move on.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:39
So that's us. So I think we might have to.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:42:47
So I'm going to share my screen. Am I sharing my screen? Right, so.

[Renu Kumari] 10:42:50
Yes, yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:43:16
Who's Kitlab?

[Renu Kumari] 10:43:25
Peter we have to leave by the 1530. Because

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:43:30
I think this is completely screwed everything today. 15, we're coming up.

[Renu Kumari] 10:43:33
Yeah.

[Renu Kumari] 10:43:38
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:43:39
We've got a few more, minutes. I was Oh, oh and I haven't I haven't shown the blue right greetings, Well done.

[Renu Kumari] 10:43:45
It's just Nithika's birthday today.

[Renu Kumari] 10:43:48
Yes, so we are going to cut the case. Yeah. Yes. Yes.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:43:55
Thank you. Thank you so much.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:43:57
Yeah.

[Sravya] 10:43:58
Hey, D.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:44:00
Thank you.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:00
So that There is my. Can you see the blue? Celebration.

[Renu Kumari] 10:44:01
Okay.

[Renu Kumari] 10:44:10
So you're already having the

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:10
There you go. Hello. Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:15
No, I've been completely thrown by this.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:44:20
Yeah, no, I wouldn't want this to happen today.

[Renu Kumari] 10:44:25
Okay. No worries.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:27
I may need to, I may need to go for a walk. What time actually going to do now is I'm going to

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:40
Well, I've got, you know, we've got to be able to use, this,

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:47
So.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:51
I'm going to just at least test that I can.

[Renu Kumari] 10:44:53
Yeah.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:44:59
No. Okay, I'm going to give. 15 min.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:45:08
Talk about how we create the paper because this is actually describing this process. So, here we go, section.

[Renu Kumari] 10:45:14
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:45:18
How we created this paper. This paper consists of, Many hundreds of pages of.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:45:30
Text data software and other material. It's primarily stored on the GitHub repository.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:45:43
And to Right an account of it, we have used a number of free but not open tools to create it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:45:56
We have daily sessions, in. The zoom protocol in the zoom system. And we.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:46:06
Capture the spoken and. Video output. In systems which transcribed this into English text. Zoom has a tool to do this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:46:23
And we also, save the results in the slack system. Which also have a transcriber.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:46:31
So the 1st step. Is to record our. Audio. And where necessary video session.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:46:41
And we plan to make this, open notebook available for everybody. We then, take the transcript or transcription created by the automatic system.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:46:56
The and, make those available. And post those, particularly on GitHub discussions.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:47:06
Which is which allows for posting and commenting by all members of the GitHub community.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:47:17
We then, take that text. And convert it into a summary. Because it's it contains quite a lot of colloquialisms and, Start stops as part of the, monologue, creation process.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:47:41
And we turn that into a rough. Transcript, of, the material. And then we are experimenting with summarization to turn it into a concise summary of the process using the

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:48:05
Open source tools such as hugging face to make a summary. Finally, we craft the Translation and summarization, there's transcription and summarization into the final PDF.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:48:23
Chapter or section for the alias article that we are authoring.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:48:32
That article is not a static article. It's an HTML document which can change day by day.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:48:42
Both after the submission of the, alice article for PDF rendering, and, well.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:48:56
Remain as a limit living document for all time. So although the PDF is a static snapshot, of the article, the crew article is a living HTML, Don't, which can be read by the whole world, which can be, commented on using whatever system it's published in, such as, at the moment.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:49:27
GitHub, which allows a discussion comments. And so forth.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:49:37
We will annotate. The HTML version, with our dictionaries, we will apply doc analysis to come up with the most important terms in that and to link it into entity recognition.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:49:56
And we will also use our own dictionaries to annotate the text and publish those annotations as a growing work.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:50:07
Which will have no fixed end date. The growing work will be strictly versioned. Because the tools we use allow and therefore it will be possible to observe what this document was at any time.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:50:25
So we would see this as an extension. Of, Ranganson's final 5th law, which was that the library is a growing organism.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:50:41
We would say that knowledge documents are a continuously growing And there I will finish because I'm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:50:55
Slightly. Yes, my brains being turned upside down. You are all wonderful.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:02
Harshal isn't here, but I would like to discuss with Harshaw, his, Summarization and look at it and so on.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:12
And I had hoped to come up with 1st pass of the sectioning. But that's not going to happen today.

[Renu Kumari] 10:51:23
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:25
Comments.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:32
I think we should practice commenting on github discussions all except Renu who has been banned and see what happens.

[Renu Kumari] 10:51:32
So.

[Renu Kumari] 10:51:41
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:45
To So, can someone attempt to post a publication, a comment on this system.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:51:56
And see if you get banned. For doing it. I know it's, wasteful, but we're going to have to experiment and see.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:52:07
At what the extent is.

[Renu Kumari] 10:52:08
Maybe they have to open the new account in which they have no other. The . And Because I did the for the same.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:52:13
Yes, that's a that's a that's a a good idea to do it.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:52:19
Also, I looked up if GitHub allows multiple accounts. So.

[Renu Kumari] 10:52:26
With the same email ID.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:52:30
No, on the same machine because I think it remembers the machine and not the email. Because

[Renu Kumari] 10:52:36
Okay. Yes Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:52:36
I, that may well be true.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:52:40
So yeah, it has been mentioned in some places that. More than 1 3 accounts are not allowed by data they suspend if you create more accounts.

[Nitika Baghel] 10:52:53
So that's also a thing.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:52:56
That's a very good point. So don't create any more accounts. We I would say comment on what we've got at the moment because it's just possible that it is related to Indian IP addresses or something of that sort.

[Renu Kumari] 10:53:01
In the

[Renu Kumari] 10:53:14
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:53:14
Hey, look at the IP address and they may decide that the IP is not acceptable.

[Renu Kumari] 10:53:20
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:53:21
Okay. We are all wonderful, and we will see what happens.

[Renu Kumari] 10:53:30
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:53:32
We're going to change the world for the better. And in 10 years time, people will look back at what we have written now and said, wow.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:53:43
I, by the way, I have published something that I wrote. 12 years ago, on my blog, I put it, I think in coordination, have I?

[Renu Kumari] 10:53:56
Hmm, yes, I, you have something, I have not seen it, but we'll see it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:53:59
No, it's about open access. And why open access was failing then. And you may find some of it useful.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:12
Okay, there we go, Amy.

[Renu Kumari] 10:54:16
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:18
W yes.

[Renu Kumari] 10:54:20
You are not have done stop recording and the process

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:24
You are quite right, Reno. So we 1st of all stop the transcript if I can find it.

[Renu Kumari] 10:54:32
SIP transcript

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:36
Where is the transcript?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:52
Where's my transcript?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:54:55
It's under all these windows.

[Renu Kumari] 10:55:17
So it was in the zoom windows.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:55:19
Yes, I'm

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:55:23
But I'm getting where of, Windows, which might, it was a free floating window.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:55:30
That was. I will.

[Renu Kumari] 10:55:30
Hmm.

[Renu Kumari] 10:55:37
You can shoot again the click on the caption button and then so full transcript it will come.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 10:55:42
Yes, that's fine

[Renu Kumari] 10:55:44
Hmm
