More specifically, an attempt in showing how microfinance can fit within the SDGs through resilience &#8211; both theoretically and as part of global development policy processes &#8211; has been put forward. For this purpose, the research conducted summative content analysis intending to inspect the prescribed subject matter of UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/69/315 with the objective of systematising, schematising and tracking the related microfinance and resilience contents. In total, 6 SDGs, 3 dimensions, 5 sub-dimensions and 16 domains emerged from the analysis.</p>
