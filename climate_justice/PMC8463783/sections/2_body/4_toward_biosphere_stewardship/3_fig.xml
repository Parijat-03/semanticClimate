Grey areas indicate regions dominated by agriculture. (<italic toggle="yes">B</italic>) Carbon stocks in vegetation and soils in major biomes and the share of each biome remaining intact today (<italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table 1). (<italic toggle="yes">C</italic>) Global average temperature changes relative to pre-industrial levels under RCP2.6, where the pathway meeting the &#8220;Paris target&#8221; is the standard RCP2.6 simulation. &#8220;Biosphere loss&#8221; shows global temperature change without land carbon sinks from 1900. The &#916;0.4 &#176;C arrow shows the estimated dampening effect up until today from land-based ecosystems. &#8220;Full NCS&#8221; assumes large-scale restoration of land-based natural carbon sinks in forests, grasslands, peatlands, and wetlands, as well as avoided future ecosystem degradation, amounting to total emission reductions of 4.6 GtC per year after 2030 (<italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Methods for details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pnas.2115218118fig01" id="gra2" position="float"/></fig>
