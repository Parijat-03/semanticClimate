<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Recent methodological evidence suggests that feasibly sized pilot studies for cluster randomised trials typically lack precision in reliably estimating recruitment and retention rates and estimates of sample sizes are biased downwards [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Sample size considerations for the pilot study were thus geared towards requirements for investigating data collection and data quality for which no formal statistical guidance exists. We therefore pragmatically aimed to recruit 15 school classes with 10&#8211;15 students each, yielding a total sample of 150&#8211;225 consenting participants.</p>
