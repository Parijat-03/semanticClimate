The codes were developed in an inductive manner. First a set of codes were derived from the articles&#8217; objectives stated above. After an initial review of a subset of the corpus the redundant codes were removed, while others were added to provide more detail. The final set of codes included &#8220;field of scholarship&#8221;; &#8220;methods for co-production&#8221;; &#8220;motivation for co-production&#8221;; &#8220;SDGs addressed&#8221;; &#8220;adaptation theme&#8221;; &#8220;synergies and tradeoffs between SDGs&#8221;; &#8220;localizing efforts of SDGs&#8221;; and &#8220;power asymmetries addressed&#8221;.</p>
