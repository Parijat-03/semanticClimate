Why should you care about climate change? Advocating for global change to halt the climate crisis and to protect our environment is not just for the Greta Thunberg&#8217;s and David Attenborough&#8217;s of the world - healthcare professionals can also help lead the charge. The World Health Organisation has called climate change &#8220;the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century&#8221;(<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The health of humanity is dependent on our environment which is changing rapidly and in disastrous ways; from rising global temperatures, increased frequency of abnormal weather patterns and natural disasters, urbanisation and destruction of vital environments for agriculture, and pollution levels, the environment has huge impacts and devastating effects on individual and population health. So, how can healthcare professionals in Northern Ireland make a difference and help combat climate change?</p>
