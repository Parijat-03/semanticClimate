![[fig2_24.png]]Figure 2.24 Growth of key technologies (2020–2040) in Paris-consistent mitigation scenarios compared to historical growth Comparisons of historical growth (grey bars) to growth in 2020–2040 mitigation scenarios (dots). Values on vertical axis are logistic annual growth rates for share of each technology in electricity supply. Horizontal arrangement of dots within technology categories indicates count of scenarios at each growth rate. Source: Data on scenarios from Chapter 3, historical data from BP (2021).
