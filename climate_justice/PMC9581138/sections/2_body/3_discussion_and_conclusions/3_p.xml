<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The different levels of analysis introduced above are associated with typical data sources, including the CS Track database with project-related attributes and metadata, forum and wiki data available on CS platforms such as Zooniverse or SciStarter as well as the open blogosphere of Twitter. Among the data and metadata found in the database, are project descriptions or documentations that were usually written by authors themselves involved in these projects in leading roles. These meso-level descriptions account for expectations and goals &#8220;behind&#8221; these projects. Text-analytic methods, including sophisticated machine learning techniques, allow these descriptions to be associated with motivational factors or skill requirements. However, these analyses cannot reveal the individual motivation or learning gains of volunteers participating in these projects. A similar discrepancy occurs with the analytics of micro-level data from forums and webpages: These data allow for following general trajectories that may indicate &#8220;personal growth&#8221; (measured, e.g., in terms of increasing network centrality) or assess the distribution of tasks between professional scientists and volunteers in the discourse. However, they do not directly give us an account of subjective perceptions like feeling satisfied or rewarded by this work. To address the individual and subjective level, the analytics results have to be complemented with data from interviews or questionnaires from project participants or other contributors. The full analysis perspective in CS Track includes this integration (also called &#8220;triangulation&#8221;) as a current focus for the project.</p>
