Wi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>) lays out a 6-stage process of interaction between grassroots organizations and government agencies within a cycle of a climate change education policy adoption. We have adapted this framework to lay out the steps of the co-creation and collaboration of student and faculty within the cycle of a climate change curriculum implementation. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref> juxtaposes the adapted 6 stages with the initial one.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 6.1</label><caption><p>A process for co-creation of a climate change curriculum between university students and faculty</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="498800_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
