This is mainly done through a content analysis that provides both qualitative assessment of the Chinese leadership&#8217;s view (how China is referred to and which characteristics are ascribed to it discursively) and quantitative measure (frequency of appearance in China&#8217;s official narratives), given that the Chinese leadership within China&#8217;s domestic political system holds the monopoly on defining China&#8217;s international identity. This article will use those key Chinese-coined concepts offered and used by China&#8217;s leaders in describing China&#8217;s international presence as key terms to search in the two types of editorials of <italic>People&#8217;s Daily</italic>&#8212;the largest and most influential state-owned newspaper in China and then count their frequency. The two editorials named as <italic>Zhongsheng</italic> and <italic>Guojiping</italic> are the main editorials that <italic>People&#8217;s Daily</italic> comments on China&#8217;s foreign policy and international affairs. From 2009 to 2019, it issued 1413 <italic>Zhongsheng</italic> articles and 54 <italic>Guojiping</italic> articles.</p>
