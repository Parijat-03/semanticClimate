<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Results from the GEE using May UHRI as the dependent variable includes beta coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), as well as the Wald chi-square statistic and its <italic>p</italic>-values (<xref rid="ijerph-18-04800-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Numbers in the Exp(Beta) column can be interpreted as the percentage change in the dependent variable (i.e., May UHRI) for every one standard deviation increase in each of the independent variables (after subtracting one and multiplying by 100). Controlling for the effects of clustering and other contextual factors, the May UHRI indicates a significant and positive association (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with the ward&#8217;s population density and the proportions of children, literate residents, agricultural workers, and households of larger size. More specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of children, literate residents, agricultural workers, and larger-size households is associated with approximately 67%, 151%, 64%, and 101% increases in values of the May UHRI, respectively. A significant and negative relationship with the dependent variable is observed in terms of proportions of households with assets and electricity (<italic>p</italic>
<underline>&lt;</underline> 0.01). A one standard deviation increase in the proportion of households with assets and those with electricity is associated with about 86% and 45% decreases in the May UHRI, respectively.</p>
