It can also help policymakers appreciate how to implement these policies. The emergent literature on health systems and climate change considers adaptation (<xref rid="czaa165-B12" ref-type="bibr">Mayhew and Hanefeld, 2014</xref>), but there is comparatively limited work on mitigation, though these will vary by context, with mitigation policies needed urgently in high-income, high-emitting countries and adaptation policies needed in countries with relatively fewer emissions, both approaches are crucial. A 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) survey found that knowledge of the health implications of climate change is shaping policymaking, however, additional financial or human resources are not being allocated to meet the challenge (<xref rid="czaa165-B25" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019</xref>). Adequate financial resources, including from climate change funding sources, have not shifted to health budgets. For example, the same survey identified financing as one the main barriers with only 9% of National Adaptation Plans for Health (H-NAP) being fully resourced (<xref rid="czaa165-B25" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019</xref>).</p>
