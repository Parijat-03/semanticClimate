The liberal tradition includes Mill&#8217;s harm principle, emphasising a duty to contemporaries, and Rawls&#8217; &#8216;just savings principle&#8217;, which conceptualises a duty to future generations. Liberal political philosophy focuses on distributional choices within and among human communities. Eco-centric approaches stress the need to achieve justice also for non-human animals or for the entirety of nature and seek to widen the &#8216;speech community&#8217; for this purpose (Eckersley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>, 123ff). Eco-centric approaches may be discerned in recent constitutional reforms, legislation and court judgements that declare the legal personality or rights of aspects of nature (O&#8217;Donnell and Talbot-Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2018</xref>). It will be seen that both EU and Chinese policies are essentially anthropocentric (although elements of ecocentrism can be discerned in the discussion of &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; within <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref>.) While this article briefly considers the principles informing EU and Chinese approaches to climate justice, it is essentially focused on the &#8216;procedural dimension of <italic>how</italic> [climate justice] can be achieved politically&#8217; (von Lucke, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2021</xref>: 16, emphasis original), i.e., how financial policies and laws in both jurisdictions target outcomes which are consistent with climate justice.</p>
