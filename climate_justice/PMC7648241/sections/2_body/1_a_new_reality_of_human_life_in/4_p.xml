For example, if this coronavirus emerged in human society, say, in rural China of 1980s, it may still cause serious disease outbreak locally but will not probably become a <italic>pandemic</italic> as it is today. It is our highly-mobile modern lifestyle&#8212;globalised travel and rapid urbanisation&#8212;that provides warp speed for the virus spreading around the world. Ironically, as Zinn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) said, COVID-19 &#8220;developed into a major social threat not mainly due to its ability to kill but by challenging our way of living&#8221;. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>) allows the virus to spread without detection&#8212;an epidemiologist called it the &#8220;invisible pandemic&#8221; (Giesecke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). This points to that disease eradication (i.e. global reduction of infection to zero cases) is awfully difficult and that without vaccines, the world will be under constant threat of virus resurgence (Heywood and Macintyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). The punctuated normalcy that was imposed as a <italic>temporary</italic> state of emergency is then morphed into a &#8220;new normal&#8221; under the pandemic.</p>
