Opportunities for (positive) experiences with discomfort and struggle (both emotional and cognitive) can be fostered, for example, through exhibitions engaging with complex socio-scientific subject matter (e.g., Navas Iannini &amp; Pedretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>). These opportunities can also be promoted by other kinds of educational initiatives developed or supported by science museums. One outstanding example is the <italic>Controversial Science Caf&#233;</italic>, periodically hosted by the museum Espa&#231;o do Conhecimento&#8212;UFMG (Knowledge Centre&#8212;Federal University of Minas Gerais) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The goal of this caf&#233; is to engage visitors in contentious discussions about complex science issues with social implications (Espa&#231;o do Conhecimento, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">n.d.</xref>). In recent times, this space has broached topics such as the challenges of urban mobility, women in STEM fields, environmental disasters involving mining, and fake news. The informal, horizontal, and close exchange between experts and the audience and the nature of the topics chosen open up a space for conversations that are difficult and inclusive.</p>
