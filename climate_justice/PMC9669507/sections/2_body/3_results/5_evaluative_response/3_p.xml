<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the <italic toggle="yes">model enhancements</italic> subtheme, comments included several
suggestions to improve the models such as assessing the performance and accuracy
of the models (e.g. &#8220;it would be interesting to compare the past predictions of
each model to the actual death count.&#8221;). Other suggestions include requests to
account for additional assumptions that were not considered during the model
development process (e.g. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem these models take into account the
potential for new infections in the vast re-opening that is planned in certain
states. They should show that effect estimated&#8221;). Commenters also suggested
developing additional models that &#8220;takes into account the impacts of mutation of
coronavirus and potential reinfection rates.&#8221; A few other comments were relevant
to the user experience of the readers as they read through the results of static
(i.e. noninteractive) models. For example, a commenter suggested for journalists
to give readers the ability to engage with the models: &#8220;It&#8217;d be great if the
designers let the readers use this tool.&#8221;</p>
