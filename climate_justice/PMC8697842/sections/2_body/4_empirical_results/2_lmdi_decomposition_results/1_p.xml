Looking at the aggregated impacts of these factors, it is possible to conclude that the trend of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased at a rate of 5134 ktons (kilotons) CO<sub>2</sub> per year, on average. It is clear that one of the main key drivers of the changes in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was the real income effect in the reviewed period.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>LMDI decomposition analysis results of Australia over 1990&#8211;2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12053_2021_10014_Fig12_HTML" id="MO12"/></fig></p>
