The terrestrial biosphere also interacts with oceans through processes such as the in&#64258; ux of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and particles. These interactions affect where and when rain falls and thus irrigation needs for crops, frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and air quality. They are modi&#64257; ed by global and regional climate change, decadal, inter-annual and seasonal climatic variations, and weather extremes, as well as human actions on land (e.g., crop and forest management, afforestation and deforestation). This in turn affects atmospheric composition, surface temperature, hydrological cycle and thus local, regional and global climate. This box introduces some of the fundamental land processes governing biophysical and biogeochemical effects and feedbacks to the climate (Box 2.1, Figure 1).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="539.0" top="351.83"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.82; y0: 351.83; y1: 359.83; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="351.83" x1="539.0">B ox 2.1, Figure 1 | The structure and functioning of managed and unmanaged ecosystems that affect local, regional and global climate.</span><span style="x0: 541.23; x1: 544.35; y0: 351.77; y1: 359.77; width: 3.11; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="541.23" y0="351.77" x1="557.23">Land surface characteristics such as albedo and emissivity determine the amount of solar and long-wave radiation absorbed by land and re&#64258; ected or emitted to the atmosphere. Surface roughness in&#64258; uences turbulent exchanges of momentum, energy, water and biogeochemical tracers. Land ecosystems modulate the atmospheric composition through emissions and removals of many GHGs and precursors of SLCFs, including biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and mineral dust. Atmospheric aerosols formed from these precursors affect regional climate by altering the amounts of precipitation and radiation reaching land surfaces through their role in clouds physics.</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.65" top="279.52"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.65; y0: 279.52; y1: 289.02; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="279.52" x1="557.65">&#8216;Biophysical interactions&#8217; are exchanges of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere (Section 2.5). Land warms up from absorbing solar and long-wave radiation; it cools down through transfers of sensible heat (via conduction and convection) and latent heat (energy associated with water evapotranspiration) to the atmosphere and through long-wave radiation emission from the land surface (Box 2.1, Figure 1). These interactions between the land and the atmosphere depend on land surface characteristics, including re&#64258; ectivity of shortwave radiation (albedo), emissivity of long wave radiation by vegetation and soils, surface roughness and soil water access by vegetation, which depends on both soil characteristics and amounts of roots. Over seasonal, inter-annual and decadal timescales, these characteristics vary among different land cover and land-use types and are affected by both natural processes and land management (Anderson et&#160;al. 2011). A dense vegetation with high leaf area index, like forests, may absorb more energy than nearby herbaceous vegetation partly due to differences in surface albedo (especially when snow is on the ground). However, denser vegetation also sends more energy back to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration (Bonan, 2008; Burakowski et&#160;al., 2018; Ellison et&#160;al., 2017) (Section 2.5.2) and this contributes to changes in atmospheric water vapour content, and subsequently to changes in rainfall. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.63" top="123.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.94; y0: 123.55; y1: 133.05; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="123.55" x1="557.63">Particularly in extra-tropical regions, these characteristics exhibit strong seasonal patterns with the development and senescence of the vegetation (e.g., leaf colour change and drop). For example, in deciduous forests, seasonal growth increases albedo by 20&#8211;50% from the spring minima to growing season maxima, followed by rapid decrease during leaf fall, whereas in grasslands, spring greening causes albedo decreases and only increases with vegetation browning (Hollinger et&#160;al. 2010). The seasonal patterns of sensible and latent heat &#64258; uxes are also driven by the cycle of leaf development and senescence in temperate deciduous forests: sensible heat &#64258; uxes&#160;peak in spring and autumn and latent heat &#64258; uxes peak in mid-summer (Moore et&#160;al. 1996; Richardson et&#160;al.&#160;2013).</span></div><div left="452.38" right="492.93" top="459.83"><span x0="452.38" y0="459.83" x1="492.93" style="x0: 452.38; x1: 456.53; y0: 459.83; y1: 467.73; width: 4.15; font-size: 7.9; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.6]; stroke: [0.898, 0.31, 0.007, 0.01]; font-family: ABIHEJ+MyriadPro-It;">precipitation</span></div><div left="402.81" right="403.94" top="418.3"><span x0="402.81" y0="418.3" x1="403.94" style="x0: 402.81; x1: 403.94; y0: 418.3; y1: 420.49; width: 1.13; font-size: 2.19; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">f</span><span x0="403.56" y0="418.81" x1="404.43" style="x0: 403.56; x1: 404.43; y0: 418.81; y1: 421.17; width: 0.87; font-size: 2.36; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">e</span><span x0="404.32" y0="419.44" x1="405.16" style="x0: 404.32; x1: 405.16; y0: 419.44; y1: 421.76; width: 0.83; font-size: 2.32; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">r</span><span x0="405.09" y0="419.91" x1="405.75" style="x0: 405.09; x1: 405.75; y0: 419.91; y1: 422.29; width: 0.66; font-size: 2.38; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">t</span><span x0="405.58" y0="420.36" x1="406.42" style="x0: 405.58; x1: 406.42; y0: 420.36; y1: 422.58; width: 0.84; font-size: 2.23; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">i</span><span x0="406.14" y0="420.58" x1="406.8" style="x0: 406.14; x1: 406.8; y0: 420.58; y1: 422.89; width: 0.66; font-size: 2.31; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">l i</span><span x0="407.6" y0="421.0" x1="407.61" style="x0: 407.6; x1: 407.61; y0: 421.0; y1: 423.51; width: 0.01; font-size: 2.51; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">z e</span><span x0="409.32" y0="421.55" x1="409.78" style="x0: 409.32; x1: 409.78; y0: 421.55; y1: 423.95; width: 0.46; font-size: 2.4; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">r f e</span><span x0="412.12" y0="418.9" x1="412.26" style="x0: 412.12; x1: 412.26; y0: 418.9; y1: 421.2; width: 0.14; font-size: 2.3; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">r t</span><span x0="413.6" y0="419.07" x1="413.66" style="x0: 413.6; x1: 413.66; y0: 419.07; y1: 421.29; width: 0.06; font-size: 2.21; fill: [0.352, 0.44, 0.747, 0.406]; stroke: [0.308, 0.393, 0.526, 0.207]; font-family: ABJGOK+Chalkboard;">i</span></div></body></html>
