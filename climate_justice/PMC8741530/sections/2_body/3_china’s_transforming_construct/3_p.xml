In September 2019, for instance, China issued a white paper <italic>China and the World in the New Era</italic> and framed itself as a <italic>yinlingzhe</italic> in &#8216;reforming and developing the global governance system&#8217; (State Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>). Since Xi&#8217;s rise to power in 2012/2013, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the term &#8216;<italic>yinlingzhe</italic>/<italic>yinling</italic>&#8217; (noun/verb) has been used much more frequently in <italic>Peoples&#8217; Daily</italic>&#8217;s editorials (<italic>Zhongsheng</italic> and <italic>Guojiping</italic>). The decrease in 2019 could be the side-result of the increasingly worsening US-China trade war which took up the most attention of the two editorials.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Term frequency of &#8216;<italic>yinlingzhe</italic>/<italic>yinling</italic>&#8217; (2009&#8211;2019)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10308_2021_643_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
