The subsidy burden of insurance on national governments is found to be significant with an estimated equivalent of 6&#160;billion USD spent by China alone on insurance (Hazell et&#160;al., 2017). In addition, the insurance programmes in Asian countries are reporting higher producer claim ratios, and often governments have to spend more than the money being transferred to the insured through the insurance programmes (Hazell et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="606.62"><span x0="54.14" y0="606.62" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.36; y0: 606.62; y1: 616.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">To address the issues associated with traditional indemnity insurance, efforts have been made to develop weather-index insurance in Asia that bases the payouts on the rainfall or temperature index, rather than on the direct damage measurements. The parametric insurance products help avoid the delays in insurance payouts as they are based on modelled risks, rather than actual damage measurements, and control the adverse selection and moral hazard, although basis risks could be increased due to improper matching of payouts with the index (De Leeuw et&#160;al., 2014). Index insurance is known to promote public&#8211;private partnerships that in turn will enhance the efficiency of overall programme delivery (Hazell and Hess, 2017). Several countries, including India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, either are currently piloting or expanding the weather-index insurance (Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2014; Tyagi and Joshi, 2019). Index insurance is constantly expanding with an estimated 194&#160;million farmers already enrolled in China and India, which is much lower than the potential number of farmers it can reach (Hazell et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="305.41" top="390.64"><span x0="54.14" y0="390.64" x1="305.41" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.19; y0: 390.64; y1: 400.14; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Few significant bottlenecks that are limiting the scaling up of weather-index insurance include lack of reliable weather data, low density of weather stations leading to high basis risk, and limited data on damage and hazard for parametric modelling of the insurance (Shirsath et&#160;al., 2019). Several innovations are being tried and tested to overcome the limitations associated with the index insurance which include developing multiscale index insurance, application of remote sensing, smartphone-based near-surface remote sensing and building insurance based on vegetation indices instead of relying on weather data alone (Hufkens et&#160;al., 2019). Alternative indices, such as the NDVI, are being tested for their applications in designing index-based insurance in India (IFAD, 2017). Agro-meteorology-based statistical analysis and crop growth modelling have been suggested to calibrate and rectify faulty weather indices (Shirsath et&#160;al., 2019; Zhu et&#160;al., 2019). Establishing automatic weather stations can improve data accuracy while preventing the delay in acquiring the weather data (Sinha and Tripathi, 2016). These technological applications have already started finding space within insurance programmes designed by national governments in Asia. For example, the government of India has released new operational guidelines for the application of new technologies such as drones, remote sensing and mobile phone apps in implementation of the national agricultural insurance, which is the third largest insurance in the world (Department of Agriculture, 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="157.89" top="102.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="102.48" x1="157.89" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 102.48; y1: 112.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.5.3 Knowledge Gaps</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="78.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="78.6" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Despite these developments, several issues still seem to hinder the penetration of insurance in Asia.

Low interest among the potential buyers due to unaffordable insurance premiums, lack of provision for partial-loss claim settlement, big hassles in the claim settlement process and lack of timely settlement of claims are reported (Parappurathu et&#160;al., 2017). In addition, insurance has been reported to have expanded the coverage of cash crops at the expense of drought-resistant subsistence crops with effects on natural capital and a potential increase in farmer&#8217;s vulnerability to market price fluctuations (M&#252;ller et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.76" top="594.62"><span x0="318.18" y0="594.62" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.12; y0: 594.62; y1: 604.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional catastrophic insurance pools have also received attention in Asia. With the formation of Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (Haraguchi and Lall, 2019), the regional insurance pool has been introduced in Southeast Asia, initially being piloted in Lao PDR and Myanmar and to be expanded to the rest of the ASEAN region. Regional catastrophic insurance allows vulnerable countries to buffer climatic shocks by diversifying the risks beyond country boundaries.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="428.75" top="486.48"><span style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.39; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.19" y0="486.48" x1="428.75">10.5.6 Social Protection</span></div><div left="318.19" right="427.3" top="462.48"><span x0="318.19" y0="462.48" x1="427.3" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.99; y0: 462.48; y1: 472.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.6.1 Point of Departure</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.76" top="438.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="438.6" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Social protection (SP) encompasses initiatives that involve transfer income or assets to the poor, protect the vulnerable against risks to their livelihood, and enhance the social status and rights of the marginalised (B&#233;n&#233; et&#160;al., 2014; Kothari, 2014). Social protection offers a wide range of instruments (e.g., cash transfers, insurance products, pension schemes and employment guarantee schemes) that can be used to support households that are exposed to climate changes (Bank, 2015). It also presents an opportunity to develop inclusive comprehensive risk management strategies to address L&amp;D from climate change as well as a means to CCA (Aleksandrova, 2019).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.75" top="306.62"><span x0="318.19" y0="306.62" x1="571.75" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 306.62; y1: 316.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Social protection programmes assist individuals and families, especially the poor and vulnerable, cope with crises and shocks, finds jobs, improve productivity, invest in the health and education of their children, and protect the ageing population (Bank, 2018b). Social protection that is well designed and implemented in a more long-term approach can enhance human capital and productivity, reduce inequalities, build resilience and empowerment, and end the inter-generational cycle of poverty (</span><span style="x0: 360.88; x1: 367.74; y0: 222.63; y1: 232.13; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="360.88" y0="222.63" x1="500.08">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span x0="500.08" y0="222.63" x1="571.75" style="x0: 500.08; x1: 502.72; y0: 222.63; y1: 232.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) as indicated from various experiences in the region such as (a) cash transfer programmes in Indonesia (Kwon and Kim, 2015), (b) the Benazir Income Support Programme in Pakistan (Watson et&#160;al., 2017), (c) the Chars Livelihoods Programme in Bangladesh (Pritchard et&#160;al., 2015) and (d) Minsei-in designated volunteer social workers in Japan (Boeckmann, 2016). A key consideration in strengthening resilience through SP programmes is to design with climate and disaster risk considerations in mind and implement in close synergy with existing programmes, such as on sustainable livelihoods, EWS and financial inclusion (Coirolo et&#160;al., 2013; Bank, 2018a).</span></div></body></html>
