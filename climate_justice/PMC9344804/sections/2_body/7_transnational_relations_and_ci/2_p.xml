An explicitly non-identitarian framing is an important feature of such movements, since it allows for supportive and encouraging forms of transversal networking.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn23">23</xref> Joint appearances both online and offline have a&#160;strong symbolic character and raise public awareness. What unites the members of the protest network against big ships and infrastructures is their ability to give a&#160;public face to an otherwise intangible phenomenon. The symbol of the large ship allows a&#160;diverse number of protest groups to call attention to the power imbalances created by dislocated and deterritorialized global economies, and to the effects they have on local practices, relations, and spaces.</p>
