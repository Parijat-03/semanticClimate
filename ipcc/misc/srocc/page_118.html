These instruments emphasise the rights in particular of indigenous peoples and local communities, including for example, recognition of the rights embedded in the access to, and use of, common land. Common land includes situations without legal ownership (e.g.,&#160;hunter-gathering communities in South America or Africa, and bushmeat), where the legal ownership is distinct from usage rights (Mediterranean transhumance grazing systems), or mixed ownership-common grazing systems (e.g., crofting in Scotland). A&#160;lack of formal (legal) ownership has often led to the loss of access rights to land, where these rights were also not formally enshrined in law, which especially effects indigenous communities, for example, deforestation in the Amazon basin. Overcoming the constraints associated with common-pool resources (forestry, &#64257;sheries, water) are often of economic and institutional nature (Hinkel et al.&#160;2014) and require tackling the absence or poor functioning of institutions and the structural constraints that they engender through access and control levers using policies and markets and other mechanisms (Schut et al.&#160;2016). Other examples of rights-based instruments include the protection of heritage sites, sacred sites and peace parks (IPBES 2018a). Rights-based instruments and customary norms are consistent with the aims of international and national human rights, and the critical issue of liability in the climate change problem.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="453.46" top="735.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 735.42; y1: 745.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.42" x1="453.46">1.4.3.4 Social and cultural norms</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="711.52" x1="566.09">Social and cultural instruments are concerned with the communication of knowledge about conscious consumption patterns and resource-effective ways of life through awareness raising, education and communication of the quality and the provenance of land-based products. Examples of the latter include consumption choices aided by ecolabelling (Section 1.4.3.2) and certi&#64257;cation. Cultural indicators (such as social capital, cooperation, gender equity, women&#8217;s knowledge,&#160;socio-ecological mobility) contribute to the resilience of social-ecological systems (Sterling et al.&#160;2017). Indigenous communities (such as the Inuit and Tsleil Waututh Nation in Canada) that continue to maintain traditional foods exhibit greater dietary quality and adequacy (Sheehy et al.&#160;2015). Social and cultural instruments also include approaches to self-regulation and voluntary agreements, especially with respect to environmental management and land resource use. This is becoming especially irrelevant for the increasingly important domain of corporate social responsibility (Halkos and Skouloudis 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="563.4" top="483.01"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 324.29; y0: 483.01; y1: 495.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="483.01" x1="563.4">1.5 The interdisciplinary nature of the SRCCL</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.14" top="459.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 459.52; y1: 469.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="459.52" x1="566.14">Assessing the land system in view of the multiple challenges that are covered by the SRCCL requires a&#160;broad, inter-disciplinary perspective. Methods, core concepts and de&#64257;nitions are used differently in different sectors, geographic regions, and across academic communities addressing land systems, and these concepts and approaches to research are also undergoing a&#160;change in their interpretation through time. These differences re&#64258;ect varying perspectives, in nuances or emphasis, on land as components of the climate and socio-economic systems. Because of its inter-disciplinary nature, the SRCCL can take advantage of these varying perspectives and the diverse methods that accompany them. That way, the report aims to support decision-makers across sectors and world regions in the interpretation of its main &#64257;ndings and support the implementation of solutions.</span></div></body></html>
