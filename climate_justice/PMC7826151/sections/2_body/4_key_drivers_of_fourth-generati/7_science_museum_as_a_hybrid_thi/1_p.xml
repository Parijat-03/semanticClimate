In a hybrid third space, &#8220;everyday resources are integrated with disciplinary learning to construct new texts and new [scientific] literacy practices that merge the different aspects of knowledge and ways of knowing offered in a variety of spaces&#8221; (Moje et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>, p. 44). Science museums as hybrid third spaces have potential to recognize the knowledge, wisdom, experiences, and learnings that visitors bring to their meaning-making in confluence with established theoretical foundations of science.</p>
