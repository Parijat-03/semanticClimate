The resulting report, &#8220;The State of Diversity in Environmental Organizations,&#8221; revealed that &#8220;The percentage of ethnic minorities on the boards or general staff of environmental organizations does not exceed 16 percent&#8221; (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>, p. 4). The report also concluded that, &#8220;once hired in environmental organizations, ethnic minorities are concentrated in the lower ranks. As a result, people of color occupy less than 12 percent of the leadership positions in the environmental organizations&#8221; (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>, p. 4). The constant failure of the green movement to improve these low percentages is known as the &#8220;green ceiling,&#8221; to indicate that there are barriers to inclusion and active hiring of historically underrepresented individuals within environmental organizations, particularly in leadership roles.</p>
