Such a linkage would provide services that are adapted to populations&#8217; evolving needs in the context of the climate crisis, transform how primary health care is delivered in the face of an evolving existential threat, reduce the health sector&#8217;s contribution to the emergency, and work across sectors and with communities to provide more unified and effective strategies to promote health and fight climate change. We believe that primary health care and the climate crisis cannot be dealt with separately. </p>
