They are studying in unfamiliar contexts and facing acute challenges in isolation. They are also questioning the value proposition of studying entirely online. Many have lost paid employment with the closure of various sectors of the economy. Many students have been relying on the clinic to provide them with experience that offers&#160;them opportunities to develop and showcase their employability. This is particularly the case for those students who do not have existing professional networks, most notably those who are &#8216;first in family&#8217; to go to university.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn69">69</xref> This very challenging context has meant that the messaging to students about the nature of their clinical experience has been important. Monash has emphasised to them the opportunities the clinic provides for them to develop and demonstrate their adaptability and flexibility along with building their use of technologies that are important for legal practice. With changes in the work done by law firms, the remote clinic provides students with opportunities to develop and showcase skills that will be important in future legal service delivery.</p>
