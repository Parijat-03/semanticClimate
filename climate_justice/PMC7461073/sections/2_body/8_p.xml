<bold>Mary:</bold> We have seen the postponement of the pivotal COP26 climate summit, and the derailment of so many other linchpin events in 2020. These adjournments cannot be reflected in a delay on climate action. In our recovery from Covid&#8208;19 we must vehemently oppose any attempts to lock in high carbon and unsustainable development through recovery packages. For example, we are already seeing some nations renewing investments in coal &#8211; coal cannot be a clean source of energy. It is imperative that the recovery from Covid&#8208;19 is completely aligned with addressing the urgency of the climate crisis and moves firmly away from any reliance on fossil fuels. Now is the time for investment in clean, renewable technologies.</p>
