When I met Pat Arnow, founder of East River Park Action, on a hot and humid early summer morning in 2021, she walked me to her favorite elm tree in the park. We sat on a shaded bench and talked while enjoying a&#160;cool breeze from the river. The elm tree had suffered damage from Sandy&#8217;s saltwater and was slated for destruction as part of the new plan, but in Pat&#8217;s view the tree was on its way to making a full recovery. Pat, who is white and in her 60&#8217;s, moved to the neighborhood in the early 2000&#8217;s after living in the&#160;U.S. south&#160;for two decades, working as a photographer for a magazine in North Carolina and for a&#160;women&#8217;s movement group in West Virginia. Before the city&#8217;s change of plans, Pat did not involve herself&#160;much in local activism. When I asked her how she came to oppose the&#160;ESCR so fervently, she summarized:&#160;&#8220;This park is so great and it makes living here a wonderful experience. Without it, living here would be kind of a bummer.&#8221; It was easy at that moment to empathize with the residents who would lose access to the park for years, even while understanding that flood protection is vitally needed. It was also easy to imagine that painful conflicts like this one in Manhattan would repeat themselves across the city and throughout coastal areas across the world.</p>
