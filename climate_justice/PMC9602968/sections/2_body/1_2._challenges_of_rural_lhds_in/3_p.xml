<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Human Resources: As noted, rural LHDs&#8217; have challenges recruiting and retaining a workforce adequate in size and capability to meet the diverse needs of their populations [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Limited access to healthcare in many rural communities, as well as rural LHDs&#8217; significant reliance on associated revenue [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], mean that rural LHD staff must focus on providing stop-gap, basic clinical health services [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, the need for professional staff to work as generalists covering a variety of services driven by permitting or other fee-for-service activities, leaves rural LHDs less equipped to support specialty-focused activities. Furthermore, limited staff capacity and competing priorities often precludes &#8220;optional&#8221; activities, such as climate change adaptation, which diminishes rural LHDs&#8217; ability to acquire additional resources to increase adaptation efforts. Limited staffing further reduces rural LHDs capacity to engage in competitive grant writing [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
