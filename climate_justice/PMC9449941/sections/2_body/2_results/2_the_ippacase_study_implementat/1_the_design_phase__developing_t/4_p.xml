The CO<sub>2</sub> limit for new cars is considered to have the most far-reaching effect as it addresses the entire new car fleet and almost all manufacturers (with the exception of very small fleets). This measure is a typical technology push measure, as it forces manufacturers to push forward technological developments and offer them on the market, with a focus on CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction during the car usage phase.</p>
