It is noteworthy that this concept is not a stand-alone predictor in current models of participation in collective action, especially in those models that attempt to explain why privileged people advocate for structurally disadvantaged people in protests and initiatives. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barth et al. (2015)</xref>, however, define the concept of solidarity of the privileged toward those suffering from the climate crisis as a form of a collective sense of responsibility. <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. (2009)</xref>, on the other hand, argue that group-based feelings of guilt or moral outrage go hand in hand with the attribution of responsibility to one&#8217;s in-group and that once this attribution becomes a feature of collective identity, certain action-related norms become salient. <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Bamberg (2014)</xref>, in turn, postulate that a collective sense of guilt leads to collective protest primarily when moral beliefs concerning the in-group are violated. It is possible that a sense of responsibility represents a condition of collective action that has always been considered implicitly by researchers. But it might be worth taking it into account as a stand-alone condition in order to position a sense of responsibility within the models and examine it in its interdependencies with the other predictors.</p>
