eight schools who contributed to the videos and reflections, as well as Maria Silvia
Emanuelli &#8211; HIC-AL Regional Coordinator &#8211; and Lorena Z&#225;rate &#8211; HIC President until
the end of 2019 &#8211; for their insights and willingness to embark on this reflexive
journey. Finally, our thanks to the team from La Sand&#237;a Digital &#8211; especially Suleica
Pineda, Ana Salgado and Yetlanezi Garc&#237;a &#8211; for their support throughout the process
to help us find a better way to narrate the stories of the schools beyond words.</p>
