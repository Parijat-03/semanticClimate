Reducing FWL would bring a&#160;range of bene&#64257;ts for health, reducing pressures on land, water and nutrients, lowering emissions and safeguarding food security. Reducing food waste by 50% would generate net emissions reductions in the range of 20 to 30% of total food-sourced GHGs (Baj&#382;elj et al.&#160;2014).

Insurance and early warning systems are examples of risk management, but risk can also be reduced (or resilience enhanced) through a&#160;broad set of options ranging from seed sovereignty, livelihood diversi&#64257;cation, to reducing land loss through urban sprawl. Early warning systems support farmer decision-making on management strategies (Section&#160;1.2) and are a&#160;good example of an adaptation measure with mitigation co-bene&#64257;ts such as reducing carbon losses (Section&#160;1.3.6). Primarily designed to avoid yield losses, early warning systems also support &#64257;re management strategies in forest ecosystems, which prevents &#64257;nancial as well as carbon losses (de Groot et al.&#160;2015). Given that over recent decades on average around 10% of cereal production was lost through extreme weather events (Lesk et al.&#160;2016), where available and affordable, insurance can buffer farmers and foresters against the &#64257;nancial losses incurred through such weather and other (&#64257;re, pests) extremes (Falco et al.&#160;2014) (Sections&#160;7.2 and&#160;7.4). Decisions to take up insurance are in&#64258;uenced by a&#160;range of factors such as the removal of subsidies or targeted education (Falco et al.&#160;2014). Enhancing access and affordability of insurance in low-income countries is a&#160;speci&#64257;c objective of the UNFCCC (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler 2006). A&#160;global mitigation co-bene&#64257;t of insurance schemes may also include incentives for future risk reduction (Surminski and Oramas-Dorta 2014).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="254.49" top="255.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 255.42; y1: 265.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="255.42" x1="254.49">1.3.5 Economics of land-based mitigation  pathways: Costs versus bene&#64257;ts of early action&#160;under uncertainty</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="207.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 207.52; y1: 217.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="207.52" x1="307.55">The overarching societal costs associated with GHG emissions and the potential implications of mitigation activities can be measured by various metrics (cost-bene&#64257;t analysis, cost effectiveness analysis) at different scales (project, technology, sector or the economy) (IPCC 2018) (Section&#160;1.4).

Both negative and positive impacts are monetised and discounted to arrive at the net value of consumption loss. As the SCC depends on discount rate assumptions and value judgements (e.g.,&#160;relative weight given to current vs future generations), it is not a&#160;straightforward policy tool to compare alternative options. At the sectoral level, marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) are widely used for the assessment </span></div><div left="318.05" right="516.94" top="735.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.63; y0: 735.54; y1: 745.04; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.54" x1="516.94">of costs related to GHG emissions reduction.

MACCs are more reliable when used to rank alternative options compared to a&#160;baseline (or business as usual) rather than offering absolute numerical measures (Huang et al.&#160;2016). The economics of land-based mitigation options encompass also the &#8220;costs of inaction&#8221; that arise either from the economic damages due to continued accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere and from the diminution in value of ecosystem services or the cost of their restoration where feasible (Rodriguez-Labajos 2013; Ricke et al.&#160;2018). Overall, it remains challenging to estimate the costs of alternative mitigation options owing to the context&#160;&#8211; and scale-speci&#64257;c interplay between multiple drivers (technological, economic, and socio-cultural) and enabling policies and institutions (IPCC 2018) (Section&#160;1.4).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="483.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="483.54" x1="566.08">The costs associated with mitigation (both project-linked such as capital costs or land rental rates, or sometimes social costs) generally increase with stringent mitigation targets and over time. Sources of uncertainty include the future availability, cost and performance of technologies (Rosen and Guenther 2015; Chen et al.&#160;2016) or lags in decision-making, which have been demonstrated by the uptake of land use and land utilisation policies (Alexander et al.&#160;2013; Hull et al.&#160;2015; Brown et al.&#160;2018b). There is growing evidence of signi&#64257;cant mitigation gains through conservation, restoration and improved land management practices (Griscom et al.&#160;2017; Kindermann et al.&#160;2008; Golub et al.&#160;2013; Favero et al.&#160;2017) (Chapters 4&#160;and&#160;6), but the mitigation cost ef&#64257;ciency can vary according to region and speci&#64257;c ecosystem (Albanito et al.&#160;2016). Recent model developments that treat process-based, human&#8211;environment interactions have recognised feedbacks that reinforce or dampen the original stimulus for land-use change (Robinson et al.&#160;2017; Walters and Scholes 2017). For instance, land mitigation interventions that rely on large-scale, land-use change (e.g.,&#160;afforestation) would need to account for the rebound effect (which dampens initial impacts due to feedbacks) in which raising land prices also raises the cost of land-based mitigation (Vivanco et al.&#160;2016). Although there are few direct estimates, indirect assessments strongly point to much higher costs if action is delayed or limited in scope (</span><span style="x0: 380.67; x1: 387.52; y0: 219.57; y1: 229.07; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="380.67" y0="219.57" x1="451.38">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 451.38; x1: 454.02; y0: 219.57; y1: 229.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="451.38" y0="219.57" x1="566.07">). Quicker response options are also needed to avoid loss of high-carbon ecosystems and other vital ecosystem services that provide multiple services that are dif&#64257;cult to replace (peatlands, wetlands, mangroves, forests) (Yirdaw et al.&#160;2017; Pedrozo-Acu&#241;a et al.&#160;2015).
