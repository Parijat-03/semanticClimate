<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our analysis of vulnerability, exposure, and adaptation needs for extreme heat comprised three stages. First, we compared the communities identified as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; based on three different vulnerability indices: CalEnviroScreen 3.0 (CES), the Heat-Health Action Index (HHAI), and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Second, we plotted different definitions of extreme heat against these indices to identify statewide relationships between vulnerability and exposure. Third, we assessed how the state has distributed heat-related CCI-funded projects in relation to community vulnerability and identified the efficacy of Assembly Bill 1550 (AB 1550) in increasing investments beyond the CES-designated communities. AB 1550 was passed by the state of California in 2016, following from concerns that low income communities that may not have pollution burden issues were also in need of climate investments [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It upholds the requirement that 25% of the GGRF goes to &#8220;disadvantaged communities&#8221; as defined by the California Environmental Protection Agency and mandates that an additional 10% of the proceeds go to low income households or communities.</p>
