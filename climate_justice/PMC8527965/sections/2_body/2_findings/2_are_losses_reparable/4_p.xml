There is already documented evidence, albeit limited, of these types of irreparable losses transpiring. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), for example, C&#225;mara-Leret et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>) highlight how climate-induced local extinctions of wild foods, medicine and ritual plants are having cascading impacts on ecosystem services and are ultimately affecting communities&#8217; wellbeing and the cultural integrity of PNG biocultural heritage. This study reiterates the cascading effects of irreparable biodiversity loss on culture and heritage and highlights the danger in creating neat nomenclature around loss as this might dilute the importance of interconnections. It, therefore, becomes highly critical for biodiversity and ecosystem deterioration to be viewed through the lens of intangible values and cultural landscapes (Morrissey and Oliver-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; McNamara et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021b</xref>).</p>
