This prioritization of property owners entirely neglects renters. Of course, there are often substantial bureaucratic barriers to timely obtaining disaster relief for homeowners (Fazio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>), but the homeowner at least has&#160;the possibility of some pay out, renters have none.</p>
