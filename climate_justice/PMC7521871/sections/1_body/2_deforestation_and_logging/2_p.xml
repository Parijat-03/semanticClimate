This figure includes clearing from logging as well as agriculture (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to air travel, individual users in the forestry sector of developing countries are subject to extensive regulation and have also lost rights due to top-down conservation governance (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#237;a-L&#243;pez, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017</xref>). Additionally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has a specific focus on land use change emissions and deforestation (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">UNFCCC, 2015</xref>). As a result, logging generally requires a permit and restrictions on forest use are legally mandated (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017</xref>). While industrial agriculture is the major culprit of land use change (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nolte et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Barsimantov and Navia Antezana, 2012</xref>), many small-scale producers and forest dependent indigenous people get grouped into these rural regulatory frameworks that challenge their livelihoods (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Jurjonas &amp; Seekamp, 2019</xref>), despite having demonstrated better conservation outcomes than protected areas in many cases (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Pazos-Almada and Bray, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Van Vleet et al., 2016</xref>), and international carbon credit and ecosystem service payment interventions frequently provide unjust pricing (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Sikor et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Corbera et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
