It covers vast geographical areas and several countries including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines (Pant and Rupa Kumar, 1997; Goswami, 2006; Gadgil et&#160;al., 2010; Shige et&#160;al., 2017), with a&#160;domain roughly extending across 60&#176;E&#8211;110&#176;E and 10&#176;S&#8211;25&#176;N as shown in Figure AV.1 (shaded pink). The SAsiaM is unique in its geographical features because of the orography surrounding the area (i.e., the Himalayas, Western Ghats and Arakan Yoma mountains, and the Tibetan Plateau to the north) and the adjacent Indian Ocean.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.05" top="522.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="522.6" x1="299.05">The SAsiaM rainy season from June to September contributes to more than 75% of the annual rainfall over much of the region, including the southern slopes of the central and eastern Himalayas (Krishnan et&#160;al., 2019b). Considering the spatial domain of the SAsiaM, monsoon precipitation maxima are located over the west coast, north-east and central/north India as well as Myanmar and Bangladesh, whereas minima are located over north-west and south-eastern India, western Pakistan, and south-eastern and northern Sri&#160;Lanka (Pant and Rupa Kumar, 1997; Gadgil et&#160;al., 2010). Prior to the SAsiaM rainy season, areas in the north-western Himalaya receive precipitation during winter and early spring from so-called &#8216;western disturbances&#8217;, which are extratropical synoptic systems originating over the Mediterranean region and propagating eastward along the subtropical westerly jet (Madhura et&#160;al., 2014; Cannon et&#160;al., 2015; Dimri et&#160;al., 2015; Hunt et&#160;al., 2018; Krishnan&#160;et&#160;al., 2019a, b).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.04" top="330.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="330.6" x1="299.04">The climatological onset of the SAsiaM occurs around 20 May over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and covers the central Bay&#160;of Bengal around 25 May, while it simultaneously advances into mainland India from the south through Kerala (Pai et&#160;al., 2020). The normal date of monsoon onset over Kerala is 1 June and the monsoon rains progress into India both from south to north and east to west, so as to cover the entire country by 15 July (Pai et&#160;al., 2020), although with large interannual and inter-decadal variations (Ghanekar et&#160;al., 2019). Retreat of the SAsiaM typically begins from far north-west India around 1 September and withdraws completely from the country by 15 October; this is followed by the establishment of the north-east monsoon rainy season over south peninsular India from October through December (Pai et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="162.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="162.6" x1="299.09">The SAsiaM exhibits prominent rainfall variability on sub-seasonal, interannual and inter-decadal time scales with teleconnections to modes of climate variability (see Webster et&#160;al., 1998; Turner and Annamalai, 2012). While the gross features of the SAsiaM are simulated in GCMs, there are several large biases that have persisted over generations of climate models, in CMIP3 and CMIP5, including a&#160;large dry bias over India coupled to a&#160;lower-tropospheric circulation that is too weak (Sperber et&#160;al., 2013) and a&#160;related wet bias over the western Equatorial Indian Ocean (Bollasina and Ming, </span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="714.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.11; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="714.6" x1="557.61">bias by limiting the available moisture (Levine et&#160;al., 2013; Sandeep and Ajayamohan, 2015). Some improvements to the spatial pattern have been noted in CMIP6, particularly near orography (Gusain et&#160;al., 2020). The teleconnection to the El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides the main prospect for seasonal prediction and was too weak in CMIP5 (Sperber et&#160;al., 2013). The boreal summer intra-seasonal oscillation (BSISO) controls the majority of sub-seasonal variations in SAsiaM rainfall, as well as affecting the East Asian monsoon region. While CMIP5 models represented the BSISO better than CMIP3 (especially its characteristic northward propagation), the spatial pattern is still poorly simulated in most models (Sabeerali&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2013). </span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="558.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 558.6; y1: 568.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="558.6" x1="557.61">The SAsiaM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.1, 8.4.2.4.1, Atlas.5.3.2 and Atlas.5.3.4.

Unlike other monsoons, it extends quite far north, out of the tropical belt, and it is largely influenced by subtropical systems, such as the western North Pacific subtropical high, East Asian subtropical westerly jet, and by disturbances from the mid-latitudes (Chang et&#160;al., 2000; Lee et&#160;al., 2006; Yim et&#160;al., 2008; Zhou et&#160;al., 2009; S.-S.

The monsoon flow brings abundant water vapour into East Asia that converges and forms the Meiyu/Baiu/Changma rain belt over the region (Zhou et&#160;al., 2009; Jin et&#160;al., 2013; Lee et&#160;al., 2017). Rainfall onset occurs in late April/early May in the central Indochina Peninsula, and in mid-June the rainy season arrives over East Asia with the formation of the Meiyu front along the Yangtze River valley, Changma in Korea, and Baiu in Japan. Later in July, the monsoon advances up to north China, the Korean Peninsula and central Japan (Zhang et&#160;al., 2004; Yihui and Chan, </span></div></body></html>
