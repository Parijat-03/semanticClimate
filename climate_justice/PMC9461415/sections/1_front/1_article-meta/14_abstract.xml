Thus, this essay aims to critically discuss the role of ecovillages within the <italic>pluriverse</italic> of community-led alternatives, understood as a plural set of socially and environmentally transformative possibilities. Adopting a decolonial perspective, this study was carried out through an exploratory qualitative approach, based on a bibliographic and documentary survey. According to the adopted premises, it is possible to recognize that communal territorial innovations, as illustrated by ecovillages&#8217; practices, may expand the horizon of solutions to face contemporary multiple crises. In line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, confluences between diverse community-led alternatives can contribute to deconstruct rooted development premises and to potentialize climate actions toward a just and sustainable transition, in tune with the triune dimensions of cultural identity, social equity, and ecological sustainability of the <italic>Buen Vivir</italic> communal ethics.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2">
