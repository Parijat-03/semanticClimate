The pandemic of 2020&#8211;2021 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown how local disease outbreaks create global risks, and distant outbreaks create local impacts. Other converging risks (for example to climate and biodiversity) are showing similar dynamics. As a result, stand-alone risk management strategies will become increasingly ineffective. Recent experience suggests that nations need now to work towards a much more comprehensive human security and sustainability action program addressing a complex system of multiple risks simultaneously. To avoid converging catastrophes, we must confront multiple challenges with cross-disciplinary tools, transforming our societies in multiple ways and on multiple scales: locally, regionally and globally.</p>
