Surveillance capitalism produces value through the observation, quantification and commodification of individuals&#8217; online behaviours. This data becomes the core product of these services, providing a new market with the potential to capitalise off knowledge about users&#8216; preferences (Zuboff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2018</xref>). This has implications for participation in and through these systems due to the role that surveillance plays in creating self-censorship, and the way preference engines generate sameness in the information consumed by individuals. These tendencies&#8212;in stark contrast to the view of information in markets as facilitating fair exchange, or the free-speech ethos maintained by the entrepreneurs who run social media enterprises&#8212;are problematic for democratic participation. This is due to the reduced capacity for preference formation (attacking performative aspects of speech practice) and preference realisation (via the selective satisfaction of wants at low cost).</p>
