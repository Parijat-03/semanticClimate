<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Through an approach informed by intergenerational climate justice, this paper reflects the view that the current generation has a responsibility to protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of children and youth [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, research on climate change and health has tended to be organized around climate events, such as flooding, sea level rise, or forest fires, mental and physical health harms, and individual pathologies [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, while the physical health impacts of climate change are well researched [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and although there is increasing agreement around the mental health impacts of climate change, knowledge gaps exist about the impacts to specific populations of children/youth. This paper argues that an important approach to take when working at the interface of children/youth&#8217;s experiences of climate change and mental health is to consider the interplay between the Social and Ecological Determinants of Health.</p>
