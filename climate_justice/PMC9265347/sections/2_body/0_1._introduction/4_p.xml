Results of observational studies remain largely inconsistent, with some showing positive associations between ESD and students&#8217; sustainability knowledge [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], attitudes [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and behaviours [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and others showing no relationship for the same outcomes [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, studies that test the effects of school-based ESD interventions on climate awareness and action, explore mechanisms linking these interventions to intended outcomes and assess contextual factors that potentially moderate intervention effectiveness, do not exist [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
