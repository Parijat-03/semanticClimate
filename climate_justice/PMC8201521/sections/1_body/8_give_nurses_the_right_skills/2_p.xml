Information is available from sources such as the Climate Change and Health program (at the MGH Institute of Health Professions), the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education, and Project ECHO&#8217;s Climate and Health series. These groups provide basic resources to others, including webinars, online courses, syllabi, and case studies (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">box 2</xref>). Of note is the Nigeria based GalesActGreen initiative, which focuses on building a network of climate literate nurses to serve as agents for change throughout Africa. These recent advancements are cause for celebration.</p>
