A dominant real income effect that yields an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is consistent with the literature (Kumbaro&#287;lu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>; Lise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; R&#252;stemo&#287;lu and U&#287;ural, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>; Akbostanci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). The real income effect only reduced the emissions in the periods 1990&#8211;1991, 1991&#8211;1992, and 2008&#8211;2009. Australia&#8217;s real income increased by 125.2%, from 612.8 billion US$ to 1.38 trillion US$, during the period of review (World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Hence, the per capita income in the country increased by 56.2% from 35,912.2 to 56,095.2 US$ between 1990 and 2017 (World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Therefore, the LMDI computations indicate that the real income growth in Australia caused an additional 5883.4 ktons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year on average. The cumulative impact of real income on Australia&#8217;s emissions was calculated as 158,851.4 ktons for 2017 by using the LMDI method. The cumulative share of this factor in total emissions was equal to 114.6% at the end of the studied period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref></p>
