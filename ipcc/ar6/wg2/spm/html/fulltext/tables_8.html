There are\nmany emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range\nof possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII\nalso assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios\nare analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs22. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including\nimpacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6\nSPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, AR5 WGI}</td>
