<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In his theory on risk and causality, Alex Broadbent [<xref rid="B30-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] puts forward the following points: (a) the conceptual work on causal inference is not finished; (b) the difference between cause and association needs to be examined in more detail; (c) the restrictions of epidemiological study design make finding a clear link highly difficult; and (d) these issues are not sufficiently discussed in epidemiological discourses nor in philosophy of science, even though the topic has gained wider attention among epidemiologists and other scientists in the last decade [<xref rid="B32-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Extending this conceptual work on causal inference to climatic factors and health risks, it follows that the epidemiological understanding of causality reaches its limit when applied to climate change adaptation and health outcomes. The mechanisms through which climate change indirectly affects health are hypothesized but not conclusively &#8220;proven&#8221; in the strict definition of the word. Consequently, neither have the mechanisms through which adaptation to climate change indirectly affects health. Previously acknowledged problems in climate change and health effect evaluation research include how to deal with unmeasured confounders and control groups when the exposure is climate-related, a lack of pre-tests where heat warning plans were already established before research took place, and a lack of studies examining interactions between social, clinical, and environmental factors [<xref rid="B25-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B33-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Using natural experiments to evaluate adaptation as a complex intervention could be one solution [<xref rid="B34-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and is delivering first promising results [<xref rid="B35-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, as Craig et al. [<xref rid="B34-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] describe, natural experiments in policy areas on &#8220;wider determinants of health&#8221; might lead to ambiguous results, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) ratings in systematic reviews of complex interventions have been shown to inadequately describe their evidence base [<xref rid="B24-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B36-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Beyond quantitative assessments, qualitative and process evaluations have gained increased traction in adaptation research [<xref rid="B37-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Public Health research on adaptation continues to struggle with epistemological differences between epidemiological effectiveness definitions and the application of qualitative research paradigms [<xref rid="B39-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in which studies often do not aim at reaching statistically generalizable conclusions but rather to explore phenomena in depths [<xref rid="B40-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
