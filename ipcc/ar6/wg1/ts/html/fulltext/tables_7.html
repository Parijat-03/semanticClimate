Specific global warming levels, such as 1.5&#176;C, 2&#176;C, 3&#176;C or 4&#176;C, are defined as changes in global surface temperature\nrelative to the years 1850&#8211;1900 as the baseline (the earliest period of reliable observations with sufficient geographic coverage). They\nare used to assess and communicate information about global and regional changes, linking to scenarios and used as a common basis\nfor Working Group II (WGII) and Working Group III (WGIII) assessments.

      <td>Emergence: Emergence refers to the experience or appearance of novel conditions of a particular climate variable in a given region.\nThis concept is often expressed as the ratio of the change in a climate variable relative to the amplitude of natural variations of that\nvariable (often termed a &#8216;signal-to-noise&#8217; ratio, with emergence occurring at a defined threshold of this ratio). Emergence can be\nexpressed in terms of a time or a global warming level at which the novel conditions appear and can be estimated using observations\nor model simulations.

      <td>Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO) emissions: The total net amount of CO emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human\n2 2\nactivities. Given the nearly linear relationship between cumulative CO emissions and increases in global surface temperature,\n2\ncumulative CO emissions are relevant for understanding how past and future CO emissions affect global surface temperature.\n2 2\nA related term &#8211; remaining carbon budget &#8211; is used to describe the total net amount of CO that could be released in the future by\n2\nhuman activities while keeping global warming to a specific global warming level, such as 1.5&#176;C, taking into account the warming\ncontribution from non-CO forcers as well. The remaining carbon budget is expressed from a recent specified date, while the total\n2\ncarbon budget is expressed starting from the pre-industrial period.

The strength\nof a climate driver is quantified by its effective radiative forcing (ERF), measured in W m&#8211;2. Positive ERF leads to warming, and\nnegative ERF leads to cooling. That warming or cooling in turn can change the energy imbalance through many positive (amplifying)\nor negative (dampening) climate feedbacks.

      <td>Attribution: Attribution is the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an observed change in\nclimate variables (e.g., global surface temperature, global mean sea level), or to the occurrence of extreme weather or climate-related\nevents. Attributed causal factors include human activities (such as increases in greenhouse gas concentration and aerosols, or land-use\nchange) or natural external drivers (solar and volcanic influences), and in some cases internal variability.

      <td>Committed change, long-term commitment: Changes in the climate system, resulting from past, present and future human\nactivities, which will continue long into the future (centuries to millennia) even with strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\nSome aspects of the climate system, including the terrestrial biosphere, the deep ocean and the cryosphere, respond much more slowly\nthan surface temperatures to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. As a result, there are already substantial committed changes\nassociated with past greenhouse gas emissions. For example, global mean sea level will continue to rise for thousands of years, even\nif future CO emissions are reduced to net zero and global warming halted, as excess energy due to past emissions continues to\n2\npropagate into the deep ocean and as glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt.
