      <td>Droughts usually begin as a deficit of precipitation, but then propagate to other parts of the water cycle (soils,\nrivers, snow/ice and water reservoirs). They are also influenced by factors like temperature, vegetation and\nhuman land and water management. In a warmer world, evaporation increases, which can make even wet</td>

      <td>water availability at a given location and season. Since they are locally defined, a drought in a wet place will\nnot have the same amount of water deficit as a drought in a dry region. Droughts are divided into different\ncategories based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought (precipitation),\nhydrological drought (runoff, streamflow, and reservoir storage), and agricultural or ecological drought (plant\nstress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture). Special categories of drought also exist. For\nexample, a snow drought occurs when winter snowpack levels are below average, which can cause abnormally\nlow streamflow in subsequent seasons. And while many drought events develop slowly over months or years,\nsome events, called flash droughts, can intensify over the course of days or weeks. One such event occurred\nin 2012 in the Midwestern region of North America and had a severe impact on agricultural production, with\nlosses exceeding $30 billion US dollars. Droughts typically only become a concern when they adversely affect\npeople (reducing water available for municipal, industrial, agricultural, or navigational needs) and/or ecosystems\n(adverse effects on natural flora and fauna).

      <td>Most droughts begin when precipitation is below normal for an extended period of time (meteorological\ndrought). This typically occurs when high pressure in the atmosphere sets up over a region, reducing cloud\nformation and precipitation over that area and deflecting away storms. The lack of rainfall then propagates\nacross the water cycle to create agricultural drought in soils and hydrological drought in waterways. Other\nprocesses act to amplify or alleviate droughts. For example, if temperatures are abnormally high, evaporation\nincreases, drying out soils and streams and stressing plants beyond what would have occurred from the lack of\nprecipitation alone. Vegetation can play a critical role because it modulates many important hydrologic processes\n(soil water, evapotranspiration, runoff). Human activities can also determine how severe a drought is. For\nexample, irrigating croplands can reduce the socio-economic impact of a drought; at the same time, depletion of</td>

      <td>southern Africa, south-western Australia and south-western South America, as well as tropical Central America,\nwestern Africa and the Amazon basin, precipitation is expected to decline as the world warms, increasing the\npossibility that drought will occur throughout the year (FAQ 8.3, Figure 1). Warming will decrease snowpack,\namplifying drought in regions where snowmelt is an important water resource (such as in south-western South\nAmerica). Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation, resulting in soil drying, increased plant stress, and\nimpacts on agriculture, even in regions where large changes in precipitation are not expected (such as central\nand northern Europe). If emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed, about a third of global land areas\nare projected to suffer from at least moderate drought by 2100. On the other hand, some areas and seasons\n(such as high-latitude regions in North America and Asia, and the South Asian monsoon region) may experience\nincreases in precipitation as a result of climate change, which will decrease the likelihood of droughts. FAQ 8.3,\nFigure 1 highlights the regions where climate change is expected to increase the severity of droughts.</td>
