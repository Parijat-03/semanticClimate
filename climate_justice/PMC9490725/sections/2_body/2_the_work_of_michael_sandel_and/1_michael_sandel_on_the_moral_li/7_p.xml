Such critics variously claim that markets are neutral by definition and therefore do not impose values, that markets can be designed better, or that Sandel&#8217;s objections are not new since many heterodox economists have similar critiques of markets, while ignoring the empirical facts of currently existing markets and market-based mechanisms that have major flaws and show no signs of being fixed.</p>
