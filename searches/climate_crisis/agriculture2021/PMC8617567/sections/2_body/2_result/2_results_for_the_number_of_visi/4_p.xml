<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We found that the county&#8208;level number of visits per capita in several states of the study areas (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and northwestern Texas) have the positive correlations with the COVID&#8208;19 incidence rate before the major wildfire season (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, negative correlations have been dominant in central Montana, western Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah before the wildfire season in June&#8211;July. There were more human visitations to parks detected further to the wildfires in Washington, Oregon, northern California, Montana, New Mexico, and Arizona (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Some states like Wyoming and Colorado show the negative correlations between the number of visits per capita and distance to wildfire before the major wildfire season, however, the trend switch to the opposite after August. A larger number of visits per capita was found in the counties with the larger daily minimum smoke level in the western study area. However, the trends were flipped over in August&#8211;September (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Additionally, most counties in the study area showed the negative relationships between the number of visits per capita and toxic gases except some parts in Texas, Washington, and Oregon (Figures&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d&#8211;2f</xref>).</p>
