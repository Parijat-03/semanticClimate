Significant work in the modelling community must also be done in improving transparency, by opening the scientific processes to stakeholders. This goes beyond the open nature of models and refers to the input data and scenarios driving these models. This is especially relevant for the civil society, the motives, strategies and concerns of whom must be thoroughly considered and addressed <xref rid="b0840" ref-type="bibr">[168]</xref> when looking into behavioural aspects, allowing for increased ownership and therefore robustness of resulting policy prescriptions <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Upon explicitly linking outputs with assumptions, modellers should therefore focus on harmonising common socioeconomic and technological parameters as well as scenario narratives for modelling activities and invest in clearly exploring the scope of modelling interlinkages, defining the capacity for data exchange, enabling sequential or parallel integration of the models. This will allow for model inter-comparison projects, where the differences among trajectories resulting from different models can be attributed to their specificities alone.</p>
