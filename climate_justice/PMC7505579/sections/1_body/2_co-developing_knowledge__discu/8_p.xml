Fuzzy cognitive maps <xref rid="b0635" ref-type="bibr">[127]</xref>, for instance, have been established as a communication and learning tool in scenario studies <xref rid="b0640" ref-type="bibr">[128]</xref> and extended to assess strategies and their vulnerability to uncertainties <xref rid="b0645" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>, allowing citizens to evaluate climate policy strategies from their point of view, and inform <xref rid="b0650" ref-type="bibr">[130]</xref> or improve <xref rid="b0655" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref> modelling exercises. As a commitment, however, the scientific community at large needs to embrace the true meaning of knowledge co-production and move beyond the sole realm of validation of results or consultation without any transformational impact, towards the ethos of creating partnerships with society <xref rid="b0660" ref-type="bibr">[132]</xref>. Such settings, going beyond symbolic effort to creating alliances of science and society, can genuinely help understand how society&#8217;s aspirations can be mapped <xref rid="b0665" ref-type="bibr">[133]</xref> onto requirements and opportunities of a transition driven by lifestyle changes, building on evidence of the importance of dialogue to achieve distributional justice and gender equality <xref rid="b0670" ref-type="bibr">[134]</xref>.</p>
