Many of the human activities that produce long-lived greenhouse gases also emit air pollutants, and many of these air pollutants are also &#8216;short-lived climate forcers&#8217; that affect the climate. Therefore, many options for improving air quality may also serve to limit climate change and vice versa. However, some options for improving air quality cause additional climate warming, and some actions that address climate change can worsen air quality. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="591.53"><span x0="69.02" y0="591.53" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 591.53; y1: 600.53; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate change and air pollution are both critical environmental issues that are already affecting humanity. In&#160;2016, the World Health Organization attributed 4.2 million deaths worldwide every year to ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Meanwhile, climate change impacts water resources, food production, human health, extreme events, coastal erosion, wildfires, and many other phenomena. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.78" top="537.53"><span x0="69.02" y0="537.53" x1="539.78" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 77.52; y0: 537.53; y1: 546.53; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Most human activities, including energy production, agriculture, transportation, industrial processes, waste management and residential heating and cooling, result in emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants that modify the composition of the atmosphere, leading to degradation of air quality as well as to climate change.

While this means that the issues of air pollution and climate change are intimately connected, air pollutants and greenhouse gases are often defined, investigated and regulated independently of one another in both the scientific and policy arenas. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="435.56"><span x0="69.02" y0="435.56" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 77.52; y0: 435.56; y1: 444.56; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Many sources simultaneously emit carbon dioxide and air pollutants. When we drive our fossil fuel vehicles or light a&#160;fire in the fireplace, it is not just carbon dioxide or air pollutants that are emitted, but always both. It&#160;is therefore not possible to separate emissions into two clearly distinct groups. As a&#160;result, policies aiming at addressing climate change may have benefits or side effects for air quality, and vice versa. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="381.56"><span x0="69.02" y0="381.56" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 381.56; y1: 390.56; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">For example, some short-term &#8216;win-win&#8217; policies that simultaneously improve air quality and limit climate change include the implementation of energy efficiency measures, methane capture and recovery from solid-waste management and the oil and gas industry, zero-emissions vehicles, efficient and clean stoves for heating and cooking, filtering of soot (particulate matter) for diesel vehicles, cleaner brick-kiln technology, practices that reduce burning of agricultural waste, and the eradication of burning of kerosene for lighting.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="315.58"><span x0="69.02" y0="315.58" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 315.58; y1: 324.58; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">There are, however, also &#8216;win-lose&#8217; actions. For example, wood burning is defined as carbon neutral because a&#160;tree accumulates the same amount of carbon dioxide throughout its lifetime as is released when wood from that tree is burned. However, burning wood can also result in significant emissions of air pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, that locally or regionally affect the climate, human health and ecosystems (FAQ 6.2, Figure&#160;1). Alternatively, decreasing the amount of sulphate aerosols produced by power and industrial plants, and from maritime transport, improves air quality but results in a&#160;warming influence on the climate, because those sulphate aerosols contribute to cooling the atmosphere by blocking incoming sunlight. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="213.6"><span x0="69.02" y0="213.6" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 213.6; y1: 222.6; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Air quality and climate change represent two sides of the same coin, and addressing both issues together could lead to significant synergies and economic benefits while avoiding policy actions that mitigate one of the two issues but worsen the other.</span></div></body></html>
