The IPCC Special Report on&#160;1.5&#176;C concluded that human-induced global warming has already caused an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events at the global scale (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). As an example, in central India, there has been a&#160;threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events during 1950&#8211;2015 which has in&#64258;uenced several land degradation processes, not least soil erosion (Burt et al. 2016b).

Vegetation cover, for example, is a&#160;key factor in determining soil loss through water (Nearing et al. 2005) and wind erosion (Shao 2008). Changing rainfall regimes also affect below-ground biological processes, such as fungi and bacteria (Meisner et al. 2018; Shuab et al. 2017; Asmelash et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.97" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.01; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="387.56" x1="312.97">Changing snow accumulation and snow melt alter volume and timing of hydrological &#64258;ows in and from mountain areas (Brahney et al. 2017; Lutz et al. 2014), with potentially large impacts on downstream areas.

Early modelling studies and theory suggest that light rainfall events will decrease while heavy rainfall events increase at about&#160;7% per degree of warming (Liu et al. 2009; Trenberth 2011). Such changes result in increased intensity of rainfall, which increases the erosive power of rainfall (erosivity) and hence enhances the likelihood of water erosion. Increases in rainfall intensity can even exceed the rate of increase of atmospheric moisture content (Liu et al. 2009; Trenberth 2011). Erosivity is highly correlated to the product of total rainstorm energy and the maximum 30-minute rainfall intensity of the storm (Nearing et al. 2004) and increased erosivity will exacerbate water erosion substantially (Nearing et al. 2004). However, the effects will not be uniform, but highly variable across regions (Almagro et al. 2017; Mondal et al. 2016). Several empirical studies around the world have shown the increasing intensity of rainfall (IPCC 2013b; Ma et al. 2015, 2017) and also suggest that this will be accentuated with future increased global warming (Cheng and AghaKouchak 2015; Burt et al. 2016b;&#160;O&#8217;Gorman 2015). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.5" top="507.6"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.65; y0: 507.6; y1: 517.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="507.6" x1="571.5">The very comprehensive database of direct measurements of water erosion presented by Garc&#237;a-Ruiz et al.
