A systems perspective can help. Circular-economy practices in supply chains require, for example, integrated reverse logistics, design with product remanufacturing and reusability potential in mind, and the arrangement of reclamation routes. Other systemic responses include switching the business model from products to services, deploying the potentials of digitalization, and disconnecting material use from profit and growth. These practices can help reduce demand for virgin materials, reduce waste, and regenerate natural capital, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>
