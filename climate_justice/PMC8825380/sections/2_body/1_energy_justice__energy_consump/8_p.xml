<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par11">The relation between energy consumption and fossil fuels poses a risk that energy justice solely concerns mitigation. Surely, principles for establishing what is a fair quota of emissions (Caney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>), or what entails luxury emissions and subsistence emissions (Shue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]), are investigated in climate justice, which includes principles based on historical emissions (such as polluter pays-principle, or beneficiary pays-principle), or current abilities (ability to pay-principle). Yet, we will limit the discussion to the relation between HDI and energy use, interpreted through the lens of CA. We hope to show that when supplemented with ceilings, CA is instructive as it ties the discussion to the capabilities that energy use must be relevant for.</p>
