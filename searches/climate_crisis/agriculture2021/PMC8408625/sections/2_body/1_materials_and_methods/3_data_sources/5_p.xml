<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0090">Economic data were extracted from the Eurostat database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database" id="intr0010">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database</ext-link>), which provides comparable statistics and indicators and is presented in yearly time series. To capture factors determining the economic crisis, austerity and cuts to public spending, we selected regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP); country level agriculture, forestry, fisheries spending; country level waste water spending, and country level health spending. The &#8220;Agriculture, forestry, fisheries spending&#8221; variable captures spending in rural areas that help to improve the environment and agricultural development, that can benefit agricultural workers and/or mechanize production <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In order to represent spending before and after the economic crisis, we created a baseline index for each variable set at 2007 levels, which represented negative or positive growth from the point just before the economic crisis hit Europe. Population count data to predict the number of people at risk in a region were sourced from the Socio-economic Data and Applications Center's Gridded Population of the World data set <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This data-set estimates the population count, consistent with national censuses and population registers.</p>
