<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The analysis of the original tweets (excluding retweets) revealed sentiments were mainly neutral within (92.9%) and outside (76.7%) the CS community. The ratio between positive and negative tweets was 1.8 (predominantly positive) within, and 0.89 (more or less balanced) outside. While these differences are less pronounced than we would expect from recent reports (Marlow et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Moernaut et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), they still indicate that the climate change debate is less polarized within the CS community.</p>
