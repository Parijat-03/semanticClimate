We sought to characterize student constructions of climate change in a number of ways. First, we were interested in better understanding whether these students accepted climate change, and whether they understood its impacts and the scientific consensus regarding climate change when they entered the course&#8212;as well as how those views and understandings changed after instruction. Second, we were interested in student affect&#8212;especially how worried students were and how important climate change was to them personally&#8212;and how these sentiments shifted over the semester. Finally, we sought to understand what students thought about the potential to act to slow or stop climate change, and whether those thoughts changed after instruction. Our study adds to a rapidly growing body of literature on student understandings of climate change and suggests ways instructors can modify their teaching to expand beyond a readerly climate literacy. By better addressing the impact of learning about climate change on student affect, we can move toward a more writerly form of literacy where students are prepared to respond to the realities of climate change.</p>
