We focused our review on the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian agricultural system, employing MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and non-MeSH to increase search sensitivity. In our search strategy, we used keywords such as &#8220;Indian Economy and SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19,&#8221; &#8220;Labor, Farmers, and SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19,&#8221; &#8220;Agriculture and SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19,&#8221; &#8220;India&#8217;s Agricultural System and Pandemic Restrictions,&#8221; &#8220;Agricultural Sector and COVID-19 Crisis,&#8221; &#8220;Agricultural Policy and Post-COVID-19,&#8221; &#8220;Agricultural Crisis and India&#8217;s Economy,&#8221; and &#8220;Food Supply Chain, Immigrants and Coronavirus.&#8221; We also looked through the reference lists of the relevant articles to see if any studies were missing. There was no language or publishing time constraints. To facilitate the screening of publications from databases, all literature searches were downloaded into an EndNote library (version X9, Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA).</p>
