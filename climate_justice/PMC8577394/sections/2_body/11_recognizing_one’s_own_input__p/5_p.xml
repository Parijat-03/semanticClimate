In particular, people worried that the flood protection and new park could increase the value of real estate properties in the floodplain, leading to further gentrification in the LES and displacement of low-income households, ultimately benefiting real estate developers rather than long-time residents. Ana, a middle-aged woman of Puerto Rican descent working in a nonprofit in the field of emergency preparedness, grew up in LES public housing and was involved throughout the process of designing the ESCR. When we met in her midtown office in early summer of 2018, before the switch, she told me about the many summer afternoons she spent barbecuing in the park while growing up and then with her own children in recent years. When I asked her how she viewed the ESCR project before the city changed plans, she was supportive of the flood protection, but also said: &#8220;I still think with the BIG U that I sold out my community. Because of the beautifying that it would bring.&#8221; Ana was referring to a type of &#8220;green gentrification,&#8221; wherein investments in park amenities, or &#8220;beautification,&#8221; are associated with gentrification (Anguelovski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Gould &amp; Lewis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). More recently, Keenan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>), have theorized that public investments in coastal protection infrastructure could similarly raise property values: An effect of having protected buildings is that they become more desirable, thereby becoming more expensive as well.</p>
