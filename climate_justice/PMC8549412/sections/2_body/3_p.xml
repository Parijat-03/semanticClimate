The glyphosate spraying was particularly stressed in this regard. The industrial agricultural model, which is practiced on a fairly large scale particularly in the southern cone of the region, implies an intensive use of agrotoxics, thus severely impacting the health of these communities. Taking the example of Brazil alone, more than 600 new pesticides have been approved over the past two years. In other words, instead of a reduction in the use of agrotoxics, the region continues to experience an intensification of their use, which is very worrying.</p>
