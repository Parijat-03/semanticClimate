Similarly, a&#160;&#8216;co-constructive&#8217; approach is used involving a&#160;diversity of stakeholders generating policy-relevant knowledge for sustainable management of biodiversity and ES at all relevant spatial scales, by the current Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) initiative (D&#237;az et al. 2015). Invasive species are also best identi&#64257;ed and managed with the participation of people through collective decisions, coordinated programmes, and extensive research and outreach to address their complex social-ecological impacts (Wittmann et al. 2016; Epanchin-Niell et&#160;al.&#160;2010).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="435.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.6; y0: 435.56; y1: 445.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="435.56" x1="313.27">Ecosystem restoration with co-bene&#64257;ts for diverse ES can be achieved through passive restoration, passive restoration with protection, and active restoration with planting (Birch et al. 2010; Cantarello et al. 2010). Taking into account the costs of restoration and co-bene&#64257;ts from bundles of ES (carbon, tourism, timber), the bene&#64257;t-cost ratio (BCR) of active restoration and passive restoration with protection was always less than&#160;1, suggesting that &#64257;nancial incentives would be required. Passive restoration was the most cost-effective with a&#160;BCR generally between 1&#160;and 100 for forest, grassland and shrubland restoration (TEEB 2009; Cantarello et al. 2010). Passive restoration is generally more cost-effective, but there is a&#160;danger that it could be confused with abandoned land in the absence of secure tenure and a&#160;long time period (Zahawi et al. 2014). Net social bene&#64257;ts of degraded land restoration in dry regions range from about 200&#8211;700&#160;USD per&#160;hectare (Cantarello et al. 2010). Investments in active restoration could bene&#64257;t from analyses of past land use, the natural resilience of the ecosystem, and the speci&#64257;c objectives of each project (Meli et al. 2017). One successful example is the Working for Water Programme in South Africa that linked restoration through removal of invasive species and enhanced water security (Milton et al. 2003).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="171.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 171.59; y1: 181.09; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="171.59" x1="313.22">Forest, water and energy cycle interactions and teleconnections such as contribution to rainfall potentially (Arag&#227;o 2012; Ellison et al. 2017; Paul et al. 2018; Spracklen et al. 2012) provide a&#160;foundation for achieving forest-based adaptation and mitigation goals.

Standards are normally voluntary, but can also become obligatory through legislation. A&#160;standard provides speci&#64257;cations or guidelines to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are &#64257;t for purpose, whereas certi&#64257;cation is the procedure through which an accredited party con&#64257;rms that a&#160;product, process or service is in conformity with certain standards. Standards and certi&#64257;cation are normally carried out by separate organisations for legitimacy and accountability (Section&#160;7.6.6). The International Organization for Standardization is a&#160;key source for global environmental standards. Those with special relevance for land and climate include a&#160;recent standard on combating land degradation and deserti&#64257;cation (ISO 2017) and an earlier standard on sustainable bioenergy and biomass use (ISO 2015; Walter et al. 2018).

Some certi&#64257;cation schemes and best practice guidelines are speci&#64257;c to a&#160;particular agriculture crop (e.g., soya, sugarcane) or a&#160;tree (e.g., oil palm) while others are general. International organisations promote sustainable land and biomass use through good practice guidelines, voluntary standards and jurisdictional approaches (Scarlat and Dallemand 2011; Stattman et al. 2018a). Other frameworks, such as the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) focus on monitoring land and biomass use through a&#160;set of indicators that are applied across partner countries, thereby also promoting technology/knowledge transfer (GBEP 2017). The Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative provides common guidelines for economic assessments of land degradation (Nkonya et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="207.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.28; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="207.59" x1="571.74">Whereas current standards and certi&#64257;cation focus primarily on land, climate and biomass impacts where they occur, more recent analysis considers trade-related land-use change by tracing supply chain impacts from producer to consumer, leading to the notion of &#8216;imported deforestation&#8217; that occurs from increasing demand and trade in unsustainable forest and agriculture products, which is estimated to account for 26% of all tropical deforestation (Pendrill et al. 2019). Research and implementation efforts aim to improve supply chain transparency and promote commitments to &#8216;zero deforestation&#8217; (Gardner et al. 2018a; Garrett et al. 2019; Newton et al. 2018; Godar and Gardner 2019; Godar et al. 2015, 2016).
