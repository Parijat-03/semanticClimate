In areas where vegetation was overgrazed or inappropriately tilled, the surface soil horizon was removed through erosion processes resulting in the creation of large drifting dunes that threatened settlements around Karap&#305;nar (Groneman 1968). Such dune movement had begun to affect the Karap&#305;nar settlement in 1956 (Kantarc&#305; et al. 2011). Consequently, by the early 1960s, Karap&#305;nar town and nearby villages were confronted with the danger of abandonment due to out-migration in the early 1960s (Figure&#160;3.11(1)). The reasons for increasing wind erosion in the Karap&#305;nar district can be summarised as follows: sandy material was mobilised following drying of the lake; hot and semi-arid climate conditions; overgrazing and use of pasture plants for fuel; excessive tillage; and strong prevailing winds.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="303.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 303.54; y1: 313.04; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="303.54" x1="313.24">Restoration and mitigation strategies were initiated in 1959, and today 4300 ha of land have been restored (Akay and Yildirim 2010) (Figure&#160;3.11 (2)), using speci&#64257;c measures: (i) physical measures: construction of cane screens to decrease wind speed and prevent sand movement (Figure&#160;3.11(3)); (ii) restoration of cover: increasing grass cover between screens using seeds collected from local pastures or the cultivation of rye (</span><span style="x0: 201.56; x1: 205.78; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="201.56" y0="231.56" x1="226.7">Secale </span><span style="x0: 229.18; x1: 232.69; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="229.18" y0="231.56" x1="313.25">sp.) and wheat grass (</span><span style="x0: 67.84; x1: 73.29; y0: 219.56; y1: 229.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="67.84" y0="219.56" x1="148.51">Agropyron elongatum</span><span style="x0: 148.51; x1: 151.15; y0: 219.56; y1: 229.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="148.51" y0="219.56" x1="313.24">) that are known to grow in arid and hot conditions; and (iii)&#160;afforestation: saplings obtained from nursery gardens were planted and grown between these screens.

However, up-to-date information on the actual extent of eroded soils at the regional or country level is not available. The estimates compiled by Pender et al. (2009), based on the Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM), indicate that about&#160;0.8 Mha of the irrigated croplands were subject to high degree of soil erosion in Uzbekistan. In Turkmenistan, soil erosion was indicated to be occurring in about&#160;0.7 Mha of irrigated land. In Kyrgyzstan, out of 1&#160;Mha of irrigated land in the foothill zones,&#160;0.76&#160;Mha were subject to soil erosion by water, leading to losses in crop yields of 20&#8211;60% in these eroded soils. About 0.65&#160;Mha of arable land were prone to soil erosion by wind (Mavlyanova et al. 2017). Soil erosion is widespread in rainfed and irrigated areas in Kazakhstan (Saparov 2014). About 5&#160;Mha of rainfed croplands were subject to high levels of soil erosion (Pender et al. 2009). Soil erosion by water was indicated to be a&#160;major concern in sloping areas in Tajikistan (Pender et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="231.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="231.55" x1="571.76">The major causes of soil erosion in Central Asia are related to human factors, primarily excessive water use in irrigated areas (Gupta et al. 2009), deep ploughing and lack of maintenance of vegetative cover in rainfed areas (Suleimenov et al. 2014), and overgrazing in rangelands (Mirzabaev et al. 2016). Lack of good maintenance of watering infrastructure for migratory livestock grazing, and fragmentation of livestock herds led to overgrazing near villages, increasing the soil erosion by wind (Alimaev et al. 2008). Overgrazing in the rangeland areas of the region (e.g.,&#160;particularly in Kyzylkum) contributes to dust storms, coming primarily from the Ustyurt Plateau, deserti&#64257;ed areas of Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers&#8217; deltas, the dried seabed of the Aral Sea (now called Aralkum), and the Caspian Sea (Issanova and Abuduwaili 2017; Xi and Sokolik 2015). Xi and Sokolik (2015) estimated that total dust emissions in Central Asia were 255.6 Mt in 2001, representing 10&#8211;17% of the global total. </span></div><div left="331.5" right="335.66" top="676.34"><span style="x0: 331.5; x1: 335.66; y0: 676.34; y1: 684.34; width: 4.16; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="331.5" y0="676.34" x1="335.66">2</span></div><div left="331.5" right="335.66" top="587.93"><span style="x0: 331.5; x1: 335.66; y0: 587.93; y1: 595.93; width: 4.16; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="331.5" y0="587.93" x1="335.66">4</span></div><div left="65.27" right="120.75" top="553.54"><span style="x0: 65.27; x1: 68.97; y0: 553.54; y1: 561.54; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.27" y0="553.54" x1="120.75">Figure&#160;3.11 |  (1) </span><span style="x0: 120.09; x1: 124.53; y0: 553.47; y1: 561.47; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="120.09" y0="553.47" x1="372.28">A&#160;general view of a&#160;nearby village of Karap&#305;nar town in the early 1960s (&#199;arkaci 1999). </span><span style="x0: 372.06; x1: 374.42; y0: 553.54; y1: 561.54; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="372.06" y0="553.54" x1="383.03">(2) </span><span style="x0: 382.81; x1: 387.25; y0: 553.47; y1: 561.47; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="382.81" y0="553.47" x1="571.39">A&#160;view of the Karap&#305;nar wind erosion area in 2013 (Photo: Murat T&#252;rke&#351;, 17 June 2019). </span><span style="x0: 132.61; x1: 134.97; y0: 544.04; y1: 552.04; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="132.61" y0="544.04" x1="143.42">(3) </span><span style="x0: 143.43; x1: 147.73; y0: 543.98; y1: 551.98; width: 4.3; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="143.43" y0="543.98" x1="571.42">Construction of cane screens in the early 1960s in order to decrease wind speed and prevent movement of the sand accumulations and dunes; this was one of the physical measures during the prevention and mitigation period (&#199;arkaci 1999). </span><span style="x0: 341.83; x1: 344.2; y0: 534.54; y1: 542.54; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="341.83" y0="534.54" x1="352.65">(4) </span><span style="x0: 352.31; x1: 356.76; y0: 534.48; y1: 542.48; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="352.31" y0="534.48" x1="571.4">A&#160;view of mixed vegetation, which now covers most of the Karap&#305;nar wind erosion area in 2013, the main tree species of which were selected for afforestation with respect to their resistance to the arid continental climate conditions along with a&#160;warm/ hot temperature regime over the district (Photo: Murat T&#252;rke&#351;, 17 June 2013).</span></div><div left="17.33" right="21.49" top="497.18"><span style="x0: 17.33; x1: 21.49; y0: 497.18; y1: 505.18; width: 4.16; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="17.33" y0="497.18" x1="21.49">2</span></div><div left="173.4" right="177.56" top="587.92"><span style="x0: 173.4; x1: 177.56; y0: 587.92; y1: 595.92; width: 4.16; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="173.4" y0="587.92" x1="177.56">3</span></div><div left="172.8" right="176.96" top="676.26"><span style="x0: 172.8; x1: 176.96; y0: 676.26; y1: 684.26; width: 4.16; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="172.8" y0="676.26" x1="176.96">1</span></div></body></html>
