As previous literature has shown, upstream engagement with geoengineering is particularly problematic because some of the most controversial applications are still in the making and involve a high level of uncertainty (<xref rid="bibr9-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2015</xref>). Historically, some exercises of public engagement with geoengineering have included experts, supporting the &#8216;lay public&#8217; in the identification of social and ethical concerns (<xref rid="bibr3-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Bellamy and Lezaun, 2015</xref>). In the case of our FGs, and although Group IV included academics with pre-existing knowledge on geoengineering, we didn&#8217;t explicitly invite experts to support us in the preparation of these exercises. As social scientists, it could be argued that we are also members of the &#8216;lay public&#8217;, and our own ignorance could have contributed to a caricatural version of geoengineering. As the FGs approached geoengineering as a whole, instead of focussing on specific applications, it became a proxy to unpack the socio-political, economic and ethical tensions entwined with the climate crisis.</p>
