Indeed, it is precisely because of deep <italic>diversities</italic> of concerns, relationships and positionalities (some people more &#8216;anti-capitalist&#8217; than others, some more inclined to use <italic>legal</italic> and/or <italic>moral</italic> arguments than others, some more focused on greenhouse gases or gender violence associated with &#8216;man-camps&#8217; built for pipeline construction, and so forth) that resistance movements against oil pipeline expansion are vastly growing. Glossing over positionalities relating to class, culture, ethnicity, gender, and geography-based differences can lead to under-appreciating diverse values linked with what <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barker and Pickerill (2019)</xref> call &#8220;place-agency&#8221; that stands in contrast to settler-colonial jurisdictional control. For many people arrested, the <italic>central</italic> concern is that the TMX project sits on stolen land and without consent from impacted Indigenous communities who actively oppose it. Threats of fossil fuel pipelines broadly and intensified oil risks on Indigenous land specifically, in a context of climate destruction, all became part of concerns that defendants tried to voice, with some defendants detailing illegalities committed by the pipeline construction company itself and values at stake.</p>
