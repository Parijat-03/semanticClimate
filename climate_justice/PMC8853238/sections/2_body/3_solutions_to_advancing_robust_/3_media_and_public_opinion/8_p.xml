However, as climate impacts become more frequent, it may become easier to raise their salience. Some scholars find that temperature anomalies and extreme weather increase climate concern, though effects are temporal (Borick and Rabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Egan and Mullin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>; Konisky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>); others find no link between the two (Brulle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>; Mildenberger and Leiserowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2017</xref>). Still, as climate impacts become more prevalent, there may be more opportunities for political actors, the media, and interest groups to educate the public on climate risks and to encourage policy action (Howe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2015</xref>).</p>
