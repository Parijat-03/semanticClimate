<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Herein, it can be noted that the fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to life, health, food, and a range of cultural rights, are in jeopardy [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has increasingly recognized that climate change is a human rights issue, given the profound threats posed by extreme weather events, sea level rise, climate-induced vector-borne diseases, and food and water insecurity to the right to life and health of many [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The extraction of fossil fuels, the driving cause of climate change, is also often connected to human rights violations, due to frequent expropriation of Indigenous people&#8217;s land or uncontrolled pollution [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The inequity of these impacts is undeniable. Climate resilience is not equally distributed among the world, with specific regions such as coasts, small islands, deserts, mountains, and polar regions being most affected, and already vulnerable and marginalized communities owing to age, gender, income, ethnicity and geography bearing the greatest burden of impacts, despite having contributed least to climate change [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, in the case of children, climate change undermines the effective enjoyment of children&#8217;s rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to the interconnected nature of rights, the realization or violation of one right often depends on other rights; therefore, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that climate change is one of the biggest threats to children rights including: the right to survival and development (article 6), the right to health (article 24), the right to adequate standard of living (article 27), and the right to education (article 28), among many others [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, extreme weather events such as droughts and floods as well as air pollution are affecting children&#8217;s access to school due to destruction of school infrastructure, preventive school closures, injuries of parents and teachers resulting in absenteeism [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Floods in Cambodia during 2013&#8211;2014 saw 155 schools closed for up to nine weeks, 40,000 textbooks destroyed, more than 450,000 students unable to access schools, resulting in an increase in dropout rates and grade repetitions [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Even within vulnerable population groups, the impacts are not equal across the world. Children who live in fragile or humanitarian settings are also those who are most vulnerable to climate change, often resulting in the highest levels of displacement and consequently high risk of further human rights violations such as exploitation and violence, family separation resulting in trauma, and lack of access to education [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
