<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Mole fraction, or mixing ratio, is the ratio of the number of moles of a constituent in a given volume to the total number of moles of all constituents in that volume.</p>
<p>It is usually reported for dry air. Typical values for <em>well-mixed greenhouse gases</em> are in the order of μmol mol<sup>–1</sup> (parts per million: ppm), nmol mol<sup>–1</sup> (parts per billion: ppb), and fmol mol<sup>–1</sup> (parts per trillion: ppt). Mole fraction differs from volume mixing ratio, often expressed in ppmv, etc., by the corrections for non-ideality of gases. This correction is significant relative to measurement precision for many <em>greenhouse gases</em> (Schwartz and Warneck, 1995).</p>
