[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] investigated the reasons for using an external standard (i.e., setting an SBT) rather than an internal standard (i.e., setting an internal target). They hypothesized that companies set SBTs as a symbolic act to confer legitimacy on existing efforts or as a substantive commitment to ensure their target is sufficiently ambitious. They investigated support for these motivations using CDP data for 1,752 global firms that declared targets between 2011 and 2019, of which 385 (22%) had set an SBT<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref>. Companies that had set more difficult past targets and successfully achieved past targets were more likely to set an SBT, lending support to both symbolic and substantive adoption. Companies that have more carbon-intensive operations, perceive more imminent climate change risks to their business, and perceive a greater impact from climate change risks are also more likely to set an SBT, suggesting an economic interest in addressing climate change and lending further support to substantive adoption (according to Freiberg et al.
