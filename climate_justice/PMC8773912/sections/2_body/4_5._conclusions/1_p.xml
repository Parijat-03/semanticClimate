<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CAM use in pediatric medicine is becoming increasingly popular in North America. It is vital that parents and caregivers who seek integrative methods for managing their children&#8217;s health consult health professionals who are properly trained in natural, holistic, and integrative approaches to pediatric care. Naturopathic doctors licensed in North American jurisdictions are uniquely trained in this paradigm, positioning them well to be integral members of care teams for children. Other healthcare providers are encouraged to become familiar with the regulation of NDs in their region of practice, and refer patients who would benefit from competent, evidence-informed integrative care. Through a unique emphasis on holistic, individualized care, prevention, and health optimization, co-management with a ND creates space for other healthcare providers to excel at the roles for which they are appropriately trained.</p>
