In the Philippines&#8217; Eastern Samar province, children organized a Children&#8217;s Coalition for Adaptation and Resilience, urging the local government to include children affected by 2013&#8217;s Typhoon Haiyan in consultations on recovery and adaptation plans. The children&#8217;s coalition persuaded the Hernani Municipal Council to appoint a child representative, as well as establish a local youth development council.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> As in other Pacific Islands countries, young people in Fiji and the Solomon Islands struggle with limited representation in formal governance systems: the hierarchical social structure sees them as recipients of authority rather than agents of change.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In response, young people have come together through youth councils and civil society organizations, such as Be the Change and 350 Pacific, to advocate for participation in climate change policymaking.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Young Pacific people are pushing for changes in the status quo, fighting against adult-centric hierarchical decision-making, and expanding opportunities for young people&#8217;s engagement in decision-making.<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
