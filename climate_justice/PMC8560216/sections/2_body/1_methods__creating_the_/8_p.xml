Information was gathered on people&#8217;s experiences working in large environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation. The host also communicated with women in the water and wastewater industry who shared sentiments on there not being enough female representation in the field. In total, the first&#160;author conducted 10 informal interviews to gain perspectives of what it is like being minoritized in environmental work and how a podcast might help amplify their voices and contributions to environmental sustainability.</p>
