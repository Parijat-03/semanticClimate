Of 2,343 trillion BTU of wind energy consumed nationwide, NREL estimates just 237 million BTU were generated on tribal lands, which is only 0.02% of the wind consumption! [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] What hampers the conversion of the technical potential into installed wind capacity? Why are private developers not working with tribal governments? Is there insufficient federal help? To develop business partnerships with private energy companies or to access federal resources, tribal nations must have the business acumen and administrative capacities [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261752.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to navigate issues such as the transferability of renewable energy tax credit, an inability to capitalize on the Federal Production Tax Credit and double taxation in tribal and state jurisdictions [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More broadly, a switch from a fossil fuels-based economy to renewables requires an administrative support system with low transaction costs because the political and economic underpinnings of these new technologies are still evolving.</p>
