However, the bias 3 largely depends on the reference dataset that is used; the bias with respect to the CRU dataset is twice that 4 with respect to the UDEL dataset (Takhsha et al., 2018). Arctic Ocean biases are smaller in simulation using 5 RCM downscaling approaches than in CMIP5 models in all seasons (Koenigk et al., 2015). Cassano et al. 6 (2017) showed a large sensitivity of the simulated surface climate to changes in atmospheric model physics. 7 In particular, large changes in radiative flux biases, driven by changes in simulated clouds, lead to large 8 differences in temperature and precipitation biases. CORDEX models simulate Arctic annual temperature 9 trends of 0.40&#176;C per decade over the 1979&#8211;2014 period which are less than that from ERA-Interim (0.55&#176;C 10 per decade) and station observations (0.60&#176;C per decade) (Zhou et al., 2019). The maximum temperature 11 trend of 2&#176;C per year during the 2003&#8211;2012 period over the Kara and Barents Seas in March is well captured 12 (Kohnemann et al., 2017).  13 14 CMIP5 models perform well in simulating 20th-century snowfall for the northern hemisphere, although there 15 is a positive bias in the multi-model ensemble relative to the observed data in many regions (Krasting et al., 16 2013). Lack of sufficient spatial resolution in the model topography has a serious impact on the simulation of 17 snowfall. The patterns of relative maxima and minima of snowfall, however, are captured reasonably well by 18 the models. The magnitude of annual snowfall is in better agreement over the eastern half of North America 19 (coincides with the relatively flat terrain and a higher density of stations that allow the capture the regional 20 variations of snowfall), while the largest absolute errors are found in the western part of the continent 21 (consistent with the coarse representation of the Rocky Mountains in the models as well as with biases that 22 may be present in the observational data) (Krasting et al., 2013). Over Eurasia, the snowfall maximum in the 23 central plateau of Siberia is significantly over-estimated by the models by as much as 250&#8211;300 cm. 24 25 Arctic CORDEX RCMs reproduce the dominant features of regional precipitation pattern, including the 26 precipitation magnitude and seasonal cycle, as for example shown in the Regional Arctic System Model 27 (RASM1; Hamman et al., 2016). Due to the higher spatial resolution, the RCM simulates larger amounts of 28 orographic precipitation compared to reanalyses. Overall, the simulated precipitation is within the reanalysis 29 and global model (CESM1) ensemble spread, but the Arctic river basin precipitation compares better to 30 observations (Brunke et al., 2018). However, Takhsha et al. (2018) show that the RCMs precipitation bias 31 highly depends on the observational reference dataset used. Glisan and Gutowski (2014) showed the 32 capability of RCMs to reproduce extreme daily precipitation over the western Arctic in summer. Although 33 the models underestimate extreme precipitation amounts and simulate fewer high-intensity precipitation 34 events compared to the station observations, the spatial patterns and interannual variability are roughly 35 equivalent to the observations. Years with the highest and lowest occurrences of observed extreme events are 36 simulated well. 37 38 Annual mean precipitation of ensemble global atmospheric simulations with a high horizontal resolution (60 39 km) agrees well with the observed precipitation maximum over the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea 40 (Kusunoki et al., 2015). The regional average annual precipitation according to the model is 1.1 mm, which 41 is larger than the observed value of 0.88 mm. This positive bias of 22% is partly due to model overestimates 42 of precipitation in the North Pole region, where observations show a local minimum. The spatial correlation 43 coefficient between observations and simulations is as high as 0.84. Excessive precipitation over Alaska and 44 the western Arctic is consistent with the results of Kattsov et al. (2017), but in this later study the bias over 45 the eastern Arctic and the Norwegian/Barents Sea region is opposite to the results of Kattsov et al. (2007). 46 These differences in the bias distribution can be attributed to differences in models used and in the time 47 periods of the analyses. 48 49 An ensemble of global atmospheric simulations with high horizontal resolution have been used to evaluate 50 extreme precipitation. The simulations reproduce Simple Daily Precipitation Intensity Index (SDII; defined 51 as the total annual precipitation divided by the number of rainy days) over the Greenland Sea, but 52 underestimate precipitation over other regions (Kusunoki et al., 2015). Arctic average SDII from the model 53 is 8% smaller than the observed value, a difference which originates from the overestimated number of rainy 54 days and indicates that the model tends to predict too many weak rainfall events.
