<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Scholars debate whether a direct experience with extreme weather events might influence individual-level or institutional responses to climate change. The logic is that climate mitigation is a global public good, although with local consequences. Thus, unless actors personally experience the costs of neglecting climate action, they might be unwilling to incur private costs to provide for climate mitigation through policies such as decarbonization of the electricity sector. Thus, our models include measures of tribes&#8217; ecological conditions. In addition, we consider tribes&#8217; <italic toggle="yes">climate vulnerability</italic>. We expect that climate disasters serve as focusing events. In places with fewer climate disasters, policy attention may drift away from climate change, given that native nations grapple with several pressing policy problems [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261752.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We include the total number of tribal declarations of natural disasters by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from 1997 to May 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
