As an example, the sustainable potential for fishery catches of several marine fish and shellfish is estimated to have decreased by 4.1% globally in the 70 years between 1930 and 2010 due to ocean warming. Regions like the North Sea and Celtic Sea have experienced even stronger decreases in fisheries productivity primarily due to warming, but other human activities such as overfishing have played a role as well. </span></div><div left="43.0" right="526.59" top="647.81"><span x0="43.0" y0="647.81" x1="526.59" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 49.56; y0: 647.81; y1: 659.81; width: 6.56; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Although there have been some positive impacts on agricultural productivity in some high-latitude regions, with ongoing warming, current global crop and livestock areas will become increasingly unsuitable. Even in a world with low greenhouse gas emissions (warming below 1.6&#176;C by 2100), some 8% of today&#8217;s farmland is projected to become climatically unsuitable by 2100. Under the same conditions, fisher people in Africa&#8217;s tropical regions are projected to lose between 3 to 41% of their fisheries&#8217; yield by the end of the century due to local extinctions of marine fish. Fisheries provide the main source of protein for about one-third of people living in Africa. It supports the livelihoods of 12.3 million people. Declining fish harvests could leave millions of people vulnerable to malnutrition.   </span></div><div left="43.0" right="533.17" top="545.57"><span x0="43.0" y0="545.57" x1="533.17" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 45.73; y0: 545.57; y1: 557.57; width: 2.74; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Increases in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy rain are occurring across all continents and all oceans, resulting in local mass die-offs and local extinctions because the impacts of those events already exceed what many organisms can tolerate. Prominent examples of species being pushed way beyond their temperature limits are reef-building warm-water corals that are dying. Their global decline shows that we don&#8217;t need to look into the future to recognize the urgency of climate action.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="537.02" top="470.69"><span x0="43.0" y0="470.69" x1="537.02" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 49.01; y0: 470.69; y1: 482.69; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">The more often ecosystems are impacted by extreme events and the more intense the event, the further they are pushed towards so-called tipping points. Beyond those points, abrupt and in some cases irreversible changes can occur &#8211; such as species going extinct. This risk increases steeply with rises in global temperature. Current projections indicate that at a global warming level of 2&#176;C by 2100, about 18% of all species on land will be at high risk of going extinct. But sensitive groups fare worse, with &gt;30% of insect pollinators and salamanders at high risk of extinction. If the world warms up to 4.5&#176;C, about half of all plant and animal species that we have records for will be threatened.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="537.51" top="368.21"><span x0="43.0" y0="368.21" x1="537.51" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 49.01; y0: 368.21; y1: 380.21; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">The extinction risk is especially high for cold-loving species living in the high mountains or in polar regions, where climate change impacts are unfolding at global maximum speed and extent. With global warming of around 4&#176;C by 2100 (very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario), mass mortalities and extinctions are expected that will irreversibly alter globally important areas, including those that host exceptionally rich biodiversity such as tropical coral reefs and cold-water kelp forests and the world&#8217;s rainforests. Even at lower levels of warming of 2&#176;C or less, polar fauna (including fish, penguins, seals, and polar bears), tropical coral reefs and mangroves will be under serious threat. </span></div><div left="43.0" right="536.46" top="265.97"><span x0="43.0" y0="265.97" x1="536.46" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 45.73; y0: 265.97; y1: 277.97; width: 2.74; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Impacts will continue to increase, weakening the structure, functioning and resilience of ecosystems and thus the services they provide, including their ability to regulate our world&#8217;s climate. At present, ecosystems are removing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit, hence naturally helping to balance global warming. However, logging in remaining natural forests; draining and burning of peatlands, and increasing climate change impacts, such as the thawing of Arctic permafrost, are causing some of those ecosystems to emit more carbon to the atmosphere (from decomposing dead plant material) than they naturally remove (through vegetation growth). The thawing of Arctic permafrost will cause enhanced methane release with further warming. All of these systems have the potential to contribute to accelerating climate change and further climate change will exacerbate this.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="545.77" top="149.81"><span x0="43.0" y0="149.81" x1="545.77" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 49.01; y0: 149.81; y1: 161.81; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">This and other trends can still be reversed by restoring, rebuilding and strengthening ecosystems and by managing them sustainably &#8211; which will also support the well-being and livelihoods of people. To achieve this balance, drastic greenhouse gas emissions reductions are required now to avoid further global warming and its deadly impacts on ecosystems around the world. For indeed, humans are just one of the many living organisms in our beautiful and complex world.  </span></div></body></html>
