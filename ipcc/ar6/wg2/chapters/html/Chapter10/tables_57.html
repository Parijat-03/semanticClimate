      <td>The vision of BDP is revealed by the foregoing statement from Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh. The government approved\nBDP 2100 in 2018. Achievement of a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous delta is the aspiration of the delta plan. Ensuring water and\nfood security with economic growth, environmental sustainability, climate resilience, vulnerability reduction to natural hazards and\nminimising different challenges of the delta through robust, adaptive and integrated strategies, and equitable water governance, are the\nmission of this mega plan. Under this mission, three higher-level goals and six specific goals have been determined. Three higher-level\ngoals include elimination of extreme poverty by 2030, achievement of upper middle-income status by 2030 and becoming a prosperous\ncountry beyond 2041. Six specific goals of BDP 2100 are fully linked with SDG Goals 2, 6, 13 and 14 and partially linked with Goals 1,\n5, 8, 9, 11 and 15. These specific goals comprise a wide range of issues, including land and water resources, climate change, disaster,\nwetlands and ecosystems, river systems and estuaries. The vision, mission and goals of BDP 2100 reveal that this mega plan is a holistic\nand integrated approach considering diversified themes and sectors for the whole country. The implementation of the BDP 2100 requires\ntotal spending of an amount of about 2.5% of the GDP per annum. A series of strategies have been formulated for better implementation\nof the mega plan.</td>
