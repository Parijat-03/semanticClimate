Many European governments therefore demonstratively relied on a policy guided by expert judgments. While the Swedish government followed Anders Tegnell's advice and initially indicated a strategy of herd immunity, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that decisions on containment strategies would follow the recommendations of leading virologists, such as Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charit&#233;, and the Robert Koch Institute, a government agency for disease control. The German Federal Ministry of Finance also acted in particularly close consultation with economists when it came to putting together economic stimulus packages. At the same time, legislative procedures were weakened by adjustments to a new Infection Protection Act (<italic>Infektionsschutzgesetz</italic>) in favor of administrative order rights (Schwanholz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2021</xref>, p. 67), and Chancellor Merkel spoke out against &#8216;discussion orgies&#8217; among the state governments in an internal conversation (Fiedler and Starzmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Thus, while democratic procedures and discourses were marginalized on the part of the government, experts in the meantime appeared to determine the government&#8217;s course to a substantive degree.</p>
