They could be derived from a redistribution of fossil fuels or an intensified search for new resources; however, if that were the case, it would increase greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn would increase the risk for dangerous climate change. Alternatively, the increase for C could be enabled by renewable sources&#8212;either in the form of C utilising renewable sources or D&#8211;G forfeiting their use of fossil fuels for C&#8217;s benefit and covering the loss with renewables to maintain their levels of average GJ per capita. This seems unlikely given the modest efficiency of renewables and their scarce share in the sources of total energy consumption (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Valentine et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). If no technological leaps quickly occur that make renewables highly efficient, the distribution will most likely be of fossil fuels. According to some the development and global distribution of renewables is unlikely to be anything but a decadal long strategy (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>).</p>
