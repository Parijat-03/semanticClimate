This higher projection is produced by a group of models with high 2 climate sensitivity (Forster et al., 2019), resulting in higher temperature projections after 2050 for the 3 region(Grose et al., submitted). Changes in mean annual temperature for 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C global warming 4 since preindustrial are similar to this change in the global average in most regions but higher than the global 5 average in central Australia. 6 7 There is more than 80% model agreement for projected mean annual rainfall decrease in southwest Western 8 Australia for both mid (2041-2060) and far future (2081-2100) and a significant increase in rainfall in the far 9 future (2081-2100) for the southern regions of New Zealand, with less model agreement elsewhere (Figure 10 Atlas.34:). However, there are some important seasonal and regional projections worth further explanation, 11 also see a review of Australian rainfall changes found in (Dey et al., 2019). Almost all models project 12 Southern Australia to continue getting drier in winter (JJA) and spring (SON), but a few models show little 13 change in rainfall, e.g., the CMIP5 projections for JJA under RCP8.5 between 1986-2005 and 2081-2100 is -14 32 to -2% (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology, 2015). Studies of winter rainfall change in southern 15 Australia and circulation suggest the wetter end of the range may possibly be rejected (Grose et al., 2017, 16 2019a). The CMIP5 projections of northern Australian wet season rainfall change are uncertain, from a large 17 and significant decrease to a large and significant increase, with CMIP5 projections for DJF under RCP8.5 18 between 1986-2005 and 2081-2100 of -24 to 18% (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology, 2015). Evidence 19 from warming patterns suggests a constraint on the dry end of projections (Brown et al., 2016), and currently 20 the CMIP6 ensemble has no models with a large projected rainfall decline. Ferguson et al. (2018) project that 21 between 1976-2005 and 2070-2099, summers will become wetter (mainly in northern Australia) under RCP 22 8.5. There is also evidence for a projected increase in rainfall variability in northern Australia in scales from 23 days to decades (Brown et al., 2017). Projections for eastern Australia vary by season, with moderate 24 agreement on a decrease in rainfall in winter and spring with less model agreement in summer and autumn. 25 Liu et al. (2018) find that under 1.5&#176;C warming, central and northeast Australia is projected to become 26 wetter. 27 28 Projected patterns in annual precipitation exhibit increases in the west and south of New Zealand and 29 decreases in the north and east (Ministry for the Environment, 2018). However, projected changes in mean 30 precipitation in New Zealand are expected to vary around the country and with season, where the west and 31 south are projected to experience increases in annual mean precipitation in future, while the north and east 32 are projected to experience decreases (</span><span style="x0: 226.69; x1: 234.61; y0: 368.03; y1: 379.01; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="226.69" y0="368.03" x1="311.88">medium confidence</span><span x0="311.89" y0="368.03" x1="41.45" style="x0: 311.89; x1: 315.54; y0: 368.03; y1: 379.01; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). Liu et al. (2018) project that the north island will 33 be drier, while the South Island will be wetter under both 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C warming. 34 35 CORDEX Australasia simulations at ~50 km spatial resolution reveal some more detail in projected 36 temperature and rainfall change associated with important features such as orography. For temperature, 37 enhanced warming at high elevation has been reported. For rainfall, areas where there is coincident &#8216;added 38 value&#8217; in the simulation of the current climate and &#8216;potential added value&#8217; as new information in the 39 projected climate change signal (collectively termed &#8216;realised added value&#8217;) in Australia include the 40 Australian Alps, Tasmania and parts of northern Australia (Di Virgilio et al., submitted). There have been 41 several studies of regional climate change for New Zealand and states of Australia at fine resolution (5-12 42 km), domains shown in Figure Atlas.36:, that have produced insights into regional climate change. One 43 important insight is enhanced drying in cool seasons on the windward slopes of the southern Australian Alps 44 (decreases of 20-30% compared to 10-15% in host models), and conversely a chance of enhanced rainfall 45 increase on the peaks of mountains in summer (Grose et al., 2019b), with the summer finding in line with the 46 European Alps (Giorgi et al., 2016). 47 48 49 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 152.93; y1: 163.91; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="152.93" x1="215.87">[START Figure Atlas.34: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="152.93" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 152.93; y1: 163.91; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">50 51 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 128.84; y1: 138.86; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="128.84" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.34: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="128.84" x1="507.6" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 130.96; y0: 128.84; y1: 138.86; width: 3.34; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(a&#8211;b) Mean observed trends of annual mean surface air temperature and precipitation for three </span><span x0="27.66" y0="128.63" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 128.63; y1: 139.61; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">52 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="117.38" x1="513.74" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.63; y0: 117.38; y1: 127.4; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">datasets (CRU TS, BERKELEY and EWEMBI for temperature; CRU TS, GPCC and GPCP for </span><span x0="27.66" y0="117.17" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 117.17; y1: 128.15; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">53 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="105.86" x1="527.58" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.63; y0: 105.86; y1: 115.88; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">precipitation).
