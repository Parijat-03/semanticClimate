Figure presents a&#160;summary of the chapter-level qualitative assessment of the synergies and trade-offs for selected mitigation options. Overlaps may exist in the mitigation options assessed and presented by sector and system, and interlinkages with the SDGs might differ depending on the application of that option by sector. Interactions of mitigation options with the SDGs are context-specific and dependent on the scale of implementation. For some mitigation options, these scaling and context-specific issues imply that there are both synergies and trade-offs in relation to specific SDGs. The SDGs are displayed as coloured squares. They indicate whether a&#160;synergy, trade-off, or both synergies and trade-offs exist between the SDG and the mitigation option. Confidence levels are indicated through the solidity of the squares. A solid square indicates high confidence, a&#160;partially filled square indicates medium confidence, and an outlined square indicates low confidence. The final column in the&#160;figure provides a&#160;line of sight to the chapters that provide details on context-specificity and scale of implementation. {6.3, 6.4, 6.7, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, 9.4, 9.5, 9.8, Table&#160;9.5, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.8, 11.5, Table&#160;10.3, 17.3,&#160;Figure&#160;17.1, Supplementary Material Table&#160;17.SM.1, Annex II.IV.12}</span></div></body></html>
