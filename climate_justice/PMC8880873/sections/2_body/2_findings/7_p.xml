Much to our surprise, the presence of RPS in the neighboring state is not statistically correlated with installed wind capacity. Recall, RPS was expected to create demand for renewable energy that would have motivated electricity companies to explore tribal lands for this purpose. But this demand side driver does not seem to be associated with wind installed capacity; the bottleneck seems to be on the supply side, administrative and business capacity.</p>
