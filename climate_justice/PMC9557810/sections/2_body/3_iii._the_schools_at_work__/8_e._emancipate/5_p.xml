equality;<sup>(<xref rid="fn39-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">39</xref>)</sup> it is about <italic toggle="yes">conscientisation</italic> &#8211; that
is, the process of developing a critical awareness of one&#8217;s social reality
through reflexion and action &#8211; and about counter-hegemonic practices, which are
the backbone of emancipatory pedagogies in the full sense of Freire&#8217;s
educational practice theory. To emancipate thus implies to transform the
internal conflict experienced by subordinated or colonized groups in an
oppressive society, a conflict defined as <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;double
consciousness&#8221;</italic> by W E B Du Bois.<sup>(<xref rid="fn40-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">40</xref>)</sup> This calls for activating
a shift from seeing ourselves simultaneously through our own eyes and from the
perspective of oppressive systems such as racism, patriarchy, colonialism or
neoliberalism to rediscovering and asserting our social identities as crucial
sites to imagine more socially just visions for the future of the city.</p>
