<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Global dimming refers to the observed widespread reduction in the amount of <em>solar radiation</em> received at the Earthâs surface from the 1950s to the 1980s, with an increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions appearing to have contributed. This was followed by a partial recovery since the 1990s (âbrighteningâ), particularly in industrialized areas, coincident with a reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions.</p></dd>
