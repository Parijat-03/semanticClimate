On average, across these 20 Southwestern U.S. metro areas, we found the poorest 10% of neighborhoods in each region to be 2 &#176;F hotter than the wealthiest 10% at night, although this difference was as high as 2.5 &#176;C (4 &#176;F) in Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, and Palm Springs. We found the top decile of Latinx neighborhoods in each region to be 1 &#176;C (1.8 &#176;F) warmer on average than the lowest decile at night, although up to nearly 4.5 &#176;F in some urban regions. At night, there did not appear to be a substantial temperature difference between the most heavily Black neighborhoods and the least (&lt;0.3 &#176;F), again with the caveat that Black populations in most of these metro areas are relatively small.</p>
