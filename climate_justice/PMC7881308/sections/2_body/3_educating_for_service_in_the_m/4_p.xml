The clinics put in place remote arrangements with our supervisors going &#8216;back to the future&#8217;, taking on a more conventional lawyer role and conducting file work without student involvement. At MLC, more than 300 current files required close attention in this challenging and rapidly changing situation. Clinic staff worked with new and ongoing clients to pursue their cases. These services were well received with clients appreciative of the clinic&#8217;s capacity to continue to offer valuable services in such testing circumstances.</p>
