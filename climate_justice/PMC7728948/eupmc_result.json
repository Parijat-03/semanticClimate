In 2015, the Canadian\u00a0Public\u00a0Health\u00a0Association noted emerging efforts to embrace intersectoral approaches to global change in public health research and practice. In this study, we question the extent to which Canadian Graduate Public Health Sciences Programs have kept pace with these efforts to see climate change surface as a new frontier for training the next generation of researchers and practitioners.<h4>Methods</h4>Semi-structured interviews (19) were conducted with Department Heads (or equivalents) of graduate-level Public Health Sciences Programs at 15 Canadian universities concerning the place of climate change in their respective curricula. Interviews were designed to elicit participants' institutional perspectives on the importance of climate change in the Public Health Sciences and identify perceived challenges and opportunities.<h4>Results</h4>Despite wide recognition among participants that climate change is a public health \"crisis\", very few reported having substantive curricular engagement on the topic. Key challenges identified were lack of resources, organizational issues, and political barriers. Key opportunities to adapt curricula to address this new frontier in Public Health were faculty interest and expertise, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and pressure from the institution.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings provide evidence for post-secondary Public Health Sciences Programs to understand the need to address their own sluggishness when what is needed are bold, even radical, shifts to existing curricula.", "affiliation": "Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.
