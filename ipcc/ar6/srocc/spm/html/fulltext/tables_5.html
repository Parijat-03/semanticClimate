      <td>All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71% of the\nEarth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth&#8217;s water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth\nsystem1. Around 10% of Earth&#8217;s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support\nunique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of\nwater, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced\ngreenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia\nthat cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1, 1.2}</td>

      <td>Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing\nStates, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains7 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea\nlevel rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to\nchanges in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in\nthe Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone8 is currently home to around 680 million\npeople (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home\nto 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous\npeoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is\nprojected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4&#8211;8.7% of the projected global population).\n{1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}</td>

      <td>In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic\ncarbon dioxide (CO ) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or\n2\ncryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values,\ntourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability\nreflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1, 1.2, 1.5}</td>
