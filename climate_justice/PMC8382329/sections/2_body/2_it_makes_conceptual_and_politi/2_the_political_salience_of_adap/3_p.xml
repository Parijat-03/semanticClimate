But GPGs have a normative and distributive connotation while contrasting with GPBs, and articulating an issue as a GPG enhances its status and rhetorical value for wider response (Bodansky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). Long and Woolley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2009</xref>), critics of GPGs, also agree to its rhetorical value, and this is needed for political legitimacy and public acceptance of the norm of adaptation as a GPG. Actually, rhetorics have great contribution to shaping discourse in social science, intensifying the meaning of their elements and strengthening their argumentative power (Teixera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2015</xref>). So, we find some reconciliation between the supporters and critiques of GPGs.</p>
