Tengberg and Valencia (2018) analysed the &#64257;ndings from a&#160;review of the GEF&#8217;s integrated natural resources management portfolio of projects using the transition theory framework (Figure&#160;4.7). They concluded that to remove barriers to SLM, an agricultural innovations systems approach that supports co-production of knowledge with multiple stakeholders, institutional innovations, a&#160;focus on value chains and strengthening of social capital to facilitate shared learning and collaboration could accelerate the scaling up of sustainable technologies and practices from the niche to the landscape level. Policy integration and establishment of &#64257;nancial mechanisms and incentives could contribute to overcoming barriers to a&#160;regime shift. The new SLM regime could, in turn, be stabilised and sustained at the landscape level by multi-stakeholder knowledge platforms and strategic partnerships. However, transitions to more sustainable regimes and practices are often challenged by lock-in mechanisms in the current system (Lawhon and Murphy 2012) such as economies of scale, investments already made in equipment, infrastructure and competencies, lobbying, shared beliefs, and practices, that could hamper wider adoption of SLM. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.96" top="483.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.37; y0: 483.55; y1: 493.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="483.55" x1="312.96">Adaptive, multi-level and participatory governance of social-ecological systems is considered important for regime shifts and transitions to take place (Wieczorek 2018) and essential to secure the capacity of environmental assets to support societal development over longer time periods (Folke et al. 2005). There is also recognition that effective environmental policies and programmes need to be informed by a&#160;comprehensive understanding of the biophysical, social, and economic components and processes of a&#160;system, their complex interactions, and how they respond to different changes (Kelly (Letcher) et al. 2013). But blueprint policies will not work, due to the wide diversity of rules and informal institutions used across sectors and regions of the world, especially in traditional societies (Ostrom 2009).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.93" top="327.57"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 327.57; y1: 337.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="327.57" x1="312.93">The most effective way of removing barriers to funding of SLM has been mainstreaming of SLM objectives and priorities into relevant policy and development frameworks, and combining SLM best practices with economic incentives for land users. As the short-term costs for establishing and maintaining SLM measures are generally high and constitute a&#160;barrier to adoption, land users may need to be compensated for generation of longer-term public goods, such as ecosystem services. Cost-bene&#64257;t analyses can be conducted on SLM interventions to facilitate such compensations (Liniger et al. 2011; Nkonya et al. 2016; Tengberg et al. 2016). The landscape approach is a&#160;means to reconcile competing demands on the land and remove barriers to implementation of SLM (e.g.,&#160;Sayer et al. 2013; B&#252;rgi et al. 2017). It involves an increased focus on participatory governance, development of new SLM business models, and innovative funding schemes, including insurance (Shames et al. 2014). The LDN Fund takes a&#160;landscape approach and raises private &#64257;nance for SLM and promotes market-based instruments, such as PES, certi&#64257;cation and carbon trading, that can support scaling up of SLM to improve local livelihoods, sequester carbon and enhance the resilience to climate change (Baumber et al. 2019). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="428.7" top="735.01"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 329.67; y0: 735.01; y1: 747.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.43" y0="735.01" x1="428.7">1.9 Case studies </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.52" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.53; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="711.52" x1="571.52">Climate change impacts on land degradation can be avoided, reduced or even reversed, but need to be addressed in a&#160;context-sensitive manner. Many of the responses described in this section can also provide synergies of adaptation and mitigation. In this section we provide more in-depth analysis of a&#160;number of salient aspects of how land degradation and climate change interact.

Rapid urbanisation is a&#160;severe threat to land and the provision of ecosystem services (Seto et al. 2012). However, as cities expand, the avoidance of land degradation, or the maintenance/enhancement of ecosystem services is rarely considered in planning processes. Instead, economic development and the need for space for construction is prioritised, which can result in substantial pollution of air and water sources, the degradation of existing agricultural areas and indigenous, natural or semi-natural ecosystems both within and outside of urban areas. For instance, urban areas are characterised by extensive impervious surfaces. Degraded, sealed soils beneath these surfaces do not provide the same quality of water retention as intact soils. Urban landscapes comprising 50&#8211;90% impervious surfaces can therefore result in 40&#8211;83% of rainfall becoming surface water runoff (Pataki et al. 2011). With rainfall intensity predicted to increase in many parts of the world under climate change (Royal Society 2016), increased water runoff is going to get worse. Urbanisation, land degradation and climate change are therefore strongly interlinked, suggesting the need for common solutions (Reed and Stringer 2016). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.51" top="303.55"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 303.55; y1: 313.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="303.55" x1="571.51">There is now a&#160;large body of research and application demonstrating the importance of retaining urban green infrastructure (UGI) for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (DG Environment News Alert Service, 2012; Wentworth, 2017) as an important tool to mitigate and adapt to climate change. UGI can be de&#64257;ned as all green elements within a&#160;city, including, but not limited to, retained indigenous ecosystems, parks, public greenspaces, green corridors, street trees, urban forests, urban agriculture, green roofs/walls and private domestic gardens (Tzoulas et al. 2007).
