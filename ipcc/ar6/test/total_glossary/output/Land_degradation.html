<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including <em>anthropogenic</em> climate change, expressed as a long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans.</p>
<p>[Note: This definition applies to forest and non-forest land. Changes in land condition resulting solely from natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions) are not considered to be land degradation. Reduction of biological productivity or ecological integrity or value to humans can constitute degradation, but any one of these changes need not necessarily be considered degradation.]</p>
