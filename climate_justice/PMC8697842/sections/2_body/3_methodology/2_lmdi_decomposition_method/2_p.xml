Among these mentioned decomposition techniques, the LMDI approach was recommended by Ang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>) over other techniques due to its advantages. These advantages can be listed as time independence, ability to handle zero values, and consistency in aggregation (Malla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>).</p>
