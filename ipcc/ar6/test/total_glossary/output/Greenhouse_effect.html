<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The infrared radiative effect of all infrared-absorbing constituents in the <em>atmosphere</em>. <em>Greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em>, clouds, and some <em>aerosols</em> absorb <em>terrestrial radiation</em> emitted by the Earthâs surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere. These substances emit infrared radiation in all directions, but, everything else being equal, the net amount emitted to space is normally less than would have been emitted in the absence of these absorbers because of the decline of temperature with altitude in the <em>troposphere</em> and the consequent weakening of emission. An increase in the concentration of GHGs increases the magnitude of this effect; the difference is sometimes called the enhanced greenhouse effect. The change in a GHG concentration because of <em>anthropogenic</em> emissions contributes to an <em>instantaneous radiative forcing</em>. Earthâs surface temperature and <em>troposphere</em> warm in response to this forcing, gradually restoring the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere.</p></dd>
