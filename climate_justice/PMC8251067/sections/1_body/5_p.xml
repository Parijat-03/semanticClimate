What lessons can the climate movement draw from this? Having raised public awareness of climate change but found the practical responses from politicians disappointing, influential climate activists like Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion may now need to lower their aspirations to inspire political decisions and instead focus on how to understand and contravene the driving forces that generate growing emissions. While protesting climate change has certainly raised awareness, it has accomplished remarkably little in practical terms, as Thunberg herself is the first to observe. The abundant media coverage and striking dramaturgy notwithstanding, the demands of the climate movement have remained too general and intangible to prompt significant policy decisions.</p>
