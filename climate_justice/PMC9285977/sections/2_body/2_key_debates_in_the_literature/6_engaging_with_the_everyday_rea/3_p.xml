<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There is indeed research that focuses on rethinking existing conceptualizations of socio&#8208;technical systems (Rohracher &amp; Sp&#228;th, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0241" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Rutherford, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0250" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Rutherford &amp; Coutard, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0251" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Haarstad (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0137" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) proposes that &#8220;infrastructural processes&#8221; can be understood as a distinct governance form, defined as steering by conditions in the built environment. A focus on the material structures in processes of energy transition (e.g., a metabolic approach) illustrates links between physical structures, institutions, and systems of authority (Edwards &amp; Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0122" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, most related studies are conducted within adjacent bodies of literature (e.g., socio&#8208;technical transitions research) rather than within urban climate governance studies. This limitation is compounded with the growth of a gap between rich analyses of urban theory (and related theories of identity and marginality) and climate governance studies.</p>
