parallel to the rules established by the institutions of government and academia,
and to the logics of capital.<sup>(<xref rid="fn11-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">11</xref>)</sup> In this conception, popular urbanism hosts substantial
potential to redress prevalent urban inequalities in four key dimensions: first, by
working towards the fair redistribution and commoning of the goods, services and
opportunities that are integral to the realization of habitat-related rights;
second, by amplifying the voices and claiming recognition for differentiated
identities and knowledges, particularly of those engaged in pushing the boundaries
for urban equality on an everyday basis; third, by advocating for their parity in
political participation, not just in invited spaces, but through claimed spaces of
city-making; and last, but not least, by fostering urban practices built on mutual
care and solidarity, as well as on state responsibility.<sup>(<xref rid="fn12-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">12</xref>)</sup></p>
