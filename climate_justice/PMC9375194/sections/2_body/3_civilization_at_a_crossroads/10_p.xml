But what has taken the experts by surprise is how quickly climate change in the extreme has come upon us. As John Holdren, professor of environmental policy at Harvard&#8217;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, has noted recently: &#8220;Everything we worried about is happening, and it&#8217;s all happening at the high end of projections, even faster than the previous most pessimistic estimates&#8221; (Pierson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>). For Lustgarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>), of all the devastating consequences of the high-end projections&#8212;&#8220;changing landscapes, pandemics, mass extinctions&#8212;the potential movement of hundreds of millions of &#8216;climate refugees&#8217; across the planet stands to be among the most important.&#8221;</p>
