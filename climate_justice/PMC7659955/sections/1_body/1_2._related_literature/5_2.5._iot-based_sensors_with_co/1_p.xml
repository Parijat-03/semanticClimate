For example, in villages where access to water is a challenge, Khoa [<xref rid="B7-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] maintained that IoT-based sensors can be useful in water-management irrigation systems on large rural farms. In their research, the authors developed a novel system that is able to monitor soil water level and schedule sprinkling/spraying times in well-calculated amounts. This relatively cheap technique, functions by receiving real-time data from sensors fixed within strategically arranged tunnels, in and around the farm. Based on the information supplied by sensors, which can be received through a mobile phone application, the user might decide to water the farm. Subsequently, when soil water level increases to an optimal level, the system notifies the user, who can remotely or manually switch-off the water-pumps. A unique feature of this system is its usability in up to two farms [<xref rid="B7-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a similar study, Nagpure et al. [<xref rid="B40-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] described another IoT-based system that works by using a similar routine as [<xref rid="B7-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, two differences include; scaring animals away using current pulses, and wireless sensor monitoring of the ecological conditions (e.g., altitude and humidity) to ascertain the amount of irrigation water needed each time [<xref rid="B40-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which the latter unit possesses. </p>
