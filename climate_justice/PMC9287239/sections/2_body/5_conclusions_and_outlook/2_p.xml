The emerging literature on target-setting methods and governance (lens 2) raises concerns as to whether the two recommended SBT-setting methods, use of renewable energy certificates, and flexible scope 3 accounting approaches and target-setting approaches will impede collective alignment with the Paris temperature goal. Apart from one study that theoretically validated the concern about existing methods leading to a combined overshoot of global allowable emissions, the validity and impact of these concerns remain largely untested. While these concerns can (and should) be theoretically and empirically analyzed, more fundamental questions relate to value judgments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] inherently embedded in SBT-setting methods and governance, most notably with respect to the allocation of global allowable emissions to individual companies. More research is needed on the implications of value judgments embedded in SBT-setting methods, freedom of choice offered to companies during target-setting, and level of transparency required from companies about these choices and the and role of stakeholders in SBT governance and decision-making.</p>
