Interactions\nbetween plants and soil microbes further modulate the degree of nutrient limitation on CO fertilisation (Terrer et al. 2017).\n2</td>

      <td>At the ecosystems level, enhanced CO uptake at decadal or longer timescales depends on changes in plant community composition\n2\nand ecosystem respiration, as well disturbance and natural plant mortality (De Kauwe et al., 2016; Farrior et al., 2015; Keenan et al.,\n2017; Sulman et al, 2019). The results of free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments over two decades are highly variable\nbecause of these factors (Norby et al. 2010; K&#246;rner 2015; Feng et al. 2015; Paschalis et al. 2017; Terrer et al. 2017; Du et al. 2019). Under\nhigher atmospheric CO concentrations, the ratio of CO uptake to water loss (water use efficiency (WUE)), increases and enhances\n2 2\ndrought tolerance of plants (high confidence) (Berry et al., 2010; Ainsworth and Rogers 2007).</td>

      <td>Long-term CO and water vapour flux measurements show that WUE in temperate and boreal forests of the northern hemisphere\n2\nhas increased more than predicted by photosynthetic theory and models over the past two decades (high confidence) (Keenan et al.\n2013; Lagu&#235; and Swann 2016). New theories have emerged on how CO uptake by trees is related to water loss and to the risk of\n2\ndamaging xylem (water conducting tissues) in the trunk and branches (Wolf et al. 2016a; Anderegg et al. 2018a). Tree ring studies of\nstable carbon and oxygen isotopes also detected increased WUE in recent decades (Battipaglia et al. 2013; Silva and Anand 2013; van\nder Sleen et al. 2014). Yet, tree ring studies often fail to show acceleration of tree growth rates in support of CO fertilisation, even\n2\nwhen they show increased WUE (van der Sleen et al. 2014). The International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) indicated that only about\n20% of the sites in the database showed increasing trends in tree growth that cannot be explained by climate variability, nitrogen\ndeposition, elevation or latitude. Thus there is limited evidence (low agreement) among observations of enhanced tree growth due to\nCO fertilisation of forests during the 20th century (Gedalof and Berg 2010).\n2</td>

      <td>In grasslands, although it is possible for CO fertilisation to alleviate the impacts of drought and heat stress on net carbon uptake\n2\n(Roy et al. 2016), there is low confidence about its projected magnitude. Because of its effect on water use efficiency, CO fertilisation\n2\nis expected to be pronounced in semi-arid habitats; and because of different metabolic pathways, C3 plants are expected to be more\nsensitive to elevated CO concentrations than C4 grasses (Donohue et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 2011; Derner et al. 2003). Neither of these\n2\nexpectations was observed over a 12-year study of elevated CO in a grassland system: enhanced growth was not observed during dry\n2\nsummers and growth of C4 grasses was unexpectedly stimulated, while growth of C3 grasses was not (Reich et al. 2014, 2018).</td>

      <td>There is medium confidence that CO fertilisation effects have increased water use efficiency in crops and thus reduced agricultural water\n2\nuse per unit of crop produced (Deryng et al. 2016; Nazemi and Wheater 2015; Elliott et al. 2014). This effect could lead to near-term\ncontinued greening of agricultural areas. However, current assessments of these effects are based on limited observations, mostly from\nthe temperate zone (Deryng et al. 2016).</td>

      <td>One line of evidence for CO fertilisation is the increasing land sink (&#8216;the residual land sink&#8217; in AR5) over the last 50 years as the\n2\natmospheric CO concentration has increased (Los 2013; Sitch et al. 2015; Campbell et al. 2017; Keenan and Riley 2018). A combined\n2\nanalysis of atmospheric inverse analyses, ecosystem models and forest inventory data concluded that 60% of the recent terrestrial\ncarbon sink can be directly attributed to increasing atmospheric CO (Schimel et al. 2015). A global analysis using a &#8216;reconstructed\n2\nvegetation index&#8217; (RVI) for the period 1901&#8211;2006 from MODIS satellite-derived normalised vegetation difference index (NDVI) showed\nthat CO fertilisation contributed at least 40% of the observed increase in the land carbon sink (Los 2013). Without CO fertilisation,\n2 2\nESMs are unable to simulate the increasing land sink and the observed atmospheric CO concentration growth rate since the middle\n2\nof the 20th century (Shevliakova et al. 2013). There are other mechanisms that could explain enhanced land carbon uptake such as\nincreased regional forest and shrub cover (Chen et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 and Chapter 1), and, at higher latitudes, increasing\ntemperatures and longer growing seasons (Zhu et al. 2016).</td>

      <td>In summary, there is low confidence about the magnitude of the CO effect and other factors that may explain at least a portion of\n2\nthe land sink (e.g., nitrogen deposition, increased growing season, reduced burning, erosion and re-deposition or organic sediments,\naerosol-induced cooling). Increases in atmospheric CO result in increased water use efficiency and increase leaf-level photosynthesis\n2\n(high confidence). The extent to which CO fertilisation results in plant- or ecosystem-level carbon accumulation is highly variable\n2\nand affected by other environmental constraints (high confidence). Even in ecosystems where CO fertilisation has been detected in\n2\nrecent decades, those effects are found to weaken as a result of physiological acclimation, soil nutrient limitation and other constraints\non growth (Friend et al., 2014; K&#246;rner, 2006; Pe&#241;uelas et al., 2017).</td>
