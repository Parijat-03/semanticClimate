<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Conventional approaches to poverty reduction, which may focus on alleviating a specific type of inequality such as age or disability-based discrimination, have often been ineffective in transforming the situation of LNOB people because each of the overlapping inequalities they experience fuses with, and can exacerbate, the effects of the other inequalities, making it particularly difficult to develop pathways out of poverty (Kabeer <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In particular, an apparent lack of &#8220;productive assets&#8221; may mean that marginalised people are not targeted in mainstream development projects. Rural advisory services and agricultural research organisations often select farmers with a specified minimum land area and other assets to trial innovations, for example improved seed, machinery and other agricultural practices (Bellon, Hodson, and Bergvinson <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This can, by default, exclude marginalised communities. Since they are not included in training, their potential to benefit from innovations is diminished, thus leaving them further and further behind. Their marginalisation is systemic and systematic.</p>
