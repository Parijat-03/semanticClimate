Financing instruments should be selected to suit the nature of the adaptation investment and its financial and social returns over the short and long run. In practice, poor people dependent on agri-food system livelihoods are vulnerable as a result of numerous factors, including inadequate agricultural practices, a deteriorating natural resource base, market demand for specific crops and animals, and limited access to land, secure water sources which are exacerbated by climate change. It is reasonable to accept that an integrated operation to address such vulnerabilities cannot be entirely attributed to climate change adaptation, and therefore should not be financed fully or solely by climate finance sources. The type of financial instrument to be applied should not only be defined by the type of intervention but also by the target beneficiaries and the project context. A climate change oriented rural development intervention targeting organized, medium scale producers in an upper middle income country (UMIC) will have completely different requirements to those of small scale individual subsistence farmers in a low income country (LIC). A climate justice-based argument points towards the allocation of grant climate financing to strengthen adaptive capacity and increase resilience. The principle that smallholder farmers, as bearers of a disproportionate impact of climate change, should have access to highly concessional financing applies, and the inclusion of other instruments should only be considered when appropriate in the given context.</p>
