IPCC assessments provide these metaphors with the veneer of scientific legitimacy (McMahon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>) and thereby enable them to circulate as boundary objects across science, policy and advocacy. They are powerful framing devices for climate change communication, all contribute to narrating the story of <italic>physical scarcity</italic>&#8212;that there is (too) little space and time to stay within a physical limit of global temperature change to avoid dangerous climate change.</p>
