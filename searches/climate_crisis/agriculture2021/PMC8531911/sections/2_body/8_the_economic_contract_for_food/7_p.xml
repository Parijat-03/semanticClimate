This is expressed by a Scientific Group tasked with &#8216;ensuring that the science underpinning the 2021 summit is robust, broad and independent&#8217; (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>: 28). Led by academic scientists, and certainly not frontline small-scale farmer practitioners, this elite group works from a premise of &#8216;the more global, dynamic and complex food systems become&#8217; the more challenges facing scientists (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>: 29). And, while acknowledging that &#8216;food is a contentious topic&#8217; (eg, agroecology vs biotechnology), they conclude that the Scientific Group aims &#8216;to offer a scientific basis to this diversity of perspectives&#8217; (von Braun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>: 30). The implicit message is that smallholder farming and landscape knowledges are of minimal value, even as they remain a powerful and democratic solution to biodiversity and carbon sequestering (Rosset and Altieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>).</p>
