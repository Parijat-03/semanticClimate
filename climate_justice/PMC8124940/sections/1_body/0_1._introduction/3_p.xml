These studies have identified neonatal infants, pregnant women, children under 15 years and people over 65 years as socio-demographic groups that are especially vulnerable to heat [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some occupations, such as outdoor laborers and construction workers, are exposed to the full impact of extreme heat events due to the physical exertion of their work [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Informal settlements or slums concentrate social vulnerabilities due to overcrowding, poor quality housing, inadequate sanitation, and lack of access to drinkable water [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moving beyond single indicators, two studies are noteworthy in their conceptualization of heat vulnerability in composite terms through indicators that represent (a) exposure, such as degree of heat, and poverty; (b) sensitivity/susceptibility, such as social and health characteristics, housing condition, and unemployment; and (c) adaptive capacity, such as electricity, literacy, and television ownership [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Additionally, recent environmental justice studies in India have utilized Census data to measure social disadvantage through caste and tribal status, literacy, and housing assets and amenities [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
