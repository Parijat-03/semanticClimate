The impacts on anthropogenic emissions due to the restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been quantified and therefore the year 2020 could not be simulated for the present study. Therefore, a different year needed to be used and the year 2016 represents the best compromise between available observations and the absence of large emission events such as forest fires.</p>
