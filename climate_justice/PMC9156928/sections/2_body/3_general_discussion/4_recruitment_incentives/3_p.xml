This reflects the socioeconomic status and material realities of a segment of the UC San Diego undergraduate population, many of whom both attend school and work jobs. Students did appear to care about the climate, but they appeared not to have the time and resources to enter these particular activist spaces. This observation leads to the fundamental question of how to overcome the near-universal barriers of time and financial resources to engage in activism.</p>
