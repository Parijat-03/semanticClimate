      <td>A wide range of modelled global emission pathways and scenarios from the literature is assessed in this report, including\npathways and scenarios with and without mitigation.44 Emissions pathways and scenarios project the evolution of GHG\nemissions based on a set of internally consistent assumptions about future socio-economic conditions and related mitigation\nmeasures.45 These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Around half of all modelled global\nemission scenarios assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost emission abatement options globally. The other\nhalf look at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about\nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. Global emission pathways, including those based\non cost-effective approaches, contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with the\ncareful recognition of these assumptions. This assessment focuses on their global characteristics. The majority of the assessed\nscenarios (about 80%) have become available since the SR1.5, but some were assessed in that report. Scenarios with and\nwithout mitigation were categorised based on their projected global warming over the 21st century, following the same scheme\nas in the SR1.5 for warming up to and including 2&#176;C. {1.5, 3.2, 3.3, Annex III.II.2, Annex III.II.3}</td>
