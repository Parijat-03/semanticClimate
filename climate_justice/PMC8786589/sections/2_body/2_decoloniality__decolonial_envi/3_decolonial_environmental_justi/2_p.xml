The first concerns the need to move <italic>beyond human&#8211;nature dichotomy</italic>. This aspect builds on indigenous cosmologies (i.e. theories of the world), but is increasingly used as a framework for rethinking the human place and relations to other forms of life in other contexts (Biermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Gebara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). In this view, humans are an intrinsic and embedded part of the natural world and the underlying cause for socioecological crises relates to humans dominating nature, rather than living <italic>with</italic> nature. The notion of distributional justice is challenged because the very idea of distributing nature assumes that humans are separate from nature and can distribute it more equally between themselves (Temper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>). Imposing distributional justice is a form of epistemic injustice to indigenous and non-indigenous local groups, given that in so doing their worldviews and epistemologies are ignored and dominant Eurocentric ones imposed (Rodr&#237;guez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>). DEJ calls for a breaking of the human&#8211;nature dichotomy, which degrowth scholars term reciprocal and regenerative human&#8211;nature relationalities (Hickel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020a</xref>).</p>
