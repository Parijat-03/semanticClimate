All names, places, initiative names, and other personal details were pseudonymized. Then, a qualitative content analysis was conducted. The first analysis step consisted mainly of hermeneutic-interpretive text work, with the goal of a general basic understanding. Summaries were written in the margins for individual sections of meaning. Initial thoughts and ideas about hypotheses and theoretical connections were recorded in memos. The conclusion of the initiating text work was the writing of short descriptive case summaries, which, in addition to a kind of one-sentence description, also contained keyword-like summaries. Subsequently, main categories were formed, which were composed inductively from the initiating text work as well as from the deductively obtained categories (e.g., politicized collective identity or collective self-efficacy expectations) already established in advance. In the coding guide, the categories were supplemented with short definitions and prototypical examples. This was followed by a coding process, in which text sections were assigned to matching categories. The same text section could be coded several times. In a further step, the aim was to form inductive subcategories, to create new main categories, and, if necessary, to subsume other codes from the first coding process, as few simple categories as possible were to be formed, which were nevertheless as differentiated as necessary to answer the research questions. Finally, we conducted a second coding run with all of the categories, resulting in an aggregation of categories.</p>
