      <td>Urban areas have special interactions with the climate system, for instance in terms of heat islands and altering the water cycle, and\nthereby will be more affected by extreme climate events such as extreme heat (high confidence). With global warming, increasing\nrelative sea level compounded by increasing tropical cyclone storm surge and rainfall intensity will increase the probability of coastal\ncity flooding (high confidence). Arctic coastal settlements are particularly exposed to climate change due to sea ice retreat (high\nconfidence). Improvements in urban climate modelling and climate monitoring networks have contributed to understanding the\nmutual interaction between regional and urban climate (high confidence). {Box 10.3, 11.3, 11.5, 12.3, 12.4}</td>

      <td>Combining climate change projections with urban growth scenarios, future urbanization will amplify (very high confidence) the\nprojected local air temperature increase, particularly by strong influence on minimum temperatures, which is approximately comparable\nin magnitude to global warming (high confidence). Compared to present day, large implications are expected from the combination\nof future urban development and more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves, with more hot days and\nwarm nights adding to heat stress in cities (very high confidence). {Box 10.2, 11.3, 12.4}</td>
