Compared with other countries, the novel coronavirus is spread widely in India. So far, the reported incidence of infectious diseases has been very low, with 5,274 cases and 149 deaths as of 8 April 2020. However, with the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, people are very worried about the potential spread and impact of this disease. India needs to prepare for a possible surge. The test needs to be greatly expanded. The Government believes that the pattern of the COVID-19 epidemic is similar to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], implying that the spread is unlikely to be uniform. After the 21-day period expires, the Government plans to maintain a complete lockdown in the &#8220;hotspot&#8221; areas only and relax elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
