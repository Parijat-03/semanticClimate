The radical change required to limit warming to 1.5&#160;&#176;C, is likely to lead to some difficult policy trade-offs and tensions between respecting the planetary boundaries and building adequate social foundations globally. The IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR550">2018</xref>, p 19) state that while some synergies are possible, &#8220;mitigation options consistent with 1.5 &#176;C pathways are associated with multiple trade-offs across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&#8221;.</p>
