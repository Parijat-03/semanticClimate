A great deal has been written about this shift to the states, and a robust literature on U.S. climate federalism has emerged (e.g., Karapin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2016</xref>; Rabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2011</xref>; Thomson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2014</xref>; Woods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2021</xref>), including the significant climate policy action undertaken by states in the context of federal gridlock and policy rollbacks (Bromley-Trujillo and Holman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>).&#160;For example, after President Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, cities and states formed coalitions with major companies and institutions to proclaim, &#8220;We Are Still In&#8221; (We are still in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2021</xref>). Twenty-five governors joined the United States Climate Alliance (USCA), committing their states to the goals of the Paris Agreement (USCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2019</xref>).</p>
