The carbon productions are mitigated by the carbon neutrality factors such as the tree planting or electrical car driving. By the way, the unexpected pandemic situation could reduce the carbon emission energy source of coal and oil. Hence, it is necessary to keep the ecological integrity associated with clean air, precipitation, and meteorological factors. This is achieved by wise energy usages such as car and plant emission gas controls.</p>
