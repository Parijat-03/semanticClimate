We also find that NELD is not always absolute, and that there are losses and damages that are arguably reparable. However, we give caution here as, given this overwhelming interconnectedness, loss and damage that might be considered reparable may become more permanent due to cascading flow-on effects. This paper invokes a discussion on the interconnectedness of loss and damage and how we can address them while considering what may be more immediately reparable.</p>
