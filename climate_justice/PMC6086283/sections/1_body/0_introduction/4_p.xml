<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par5">The broad conception of sustainability and sustainable development embraced here justifies the inclusion of a religious text, such as <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;,</italic> in our analysis. We understand <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic> as a contribution to the sustainability discourse that goes beyond its own doctrinal and institutional background (Latour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). Therefore, we focus heuristically on its ethical rather than religious dimensions (Perkiss and Tweedie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> This emphasis allows us to focus on guiding norms expressed in the Encyclical and related to SD. Our analysis is based on an analytical and yet comprehensive model of norms that integrates the ethics of <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic> with the structural importance of normativity in the two UN documents that focus more on techno-scientific issues. Hence, we analyze the role of both ethical and techno-scientific norms in significant contributions to the SD discourse. We show that the three documents are complementary to each other in this perspective. Clarifying normative orientations in sustainability discourses helps to progress towards SD by making more transparent the connection of ethical, socio-political, and scientific dimensions of sustainability (Jerneck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Kl&#228;y et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>; Popa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). In this sense, our results aim to clarify the potential performance and impact of the three documents in SD discourse. It is still too early to fully assess their actual impact and performance on SD as this implies a retrospective approach.</p>
