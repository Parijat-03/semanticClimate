For example, the urban heat island effect means that higher temperatures are experienced in urban areas than in more rural ones nearby, and access to places for people to cool off in, such as shady green spaces or waterways, is often more limited. The health effects of rising exposure to high temperatures are not only physical but have also been associated with increased risks of mental ill health<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and with suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
