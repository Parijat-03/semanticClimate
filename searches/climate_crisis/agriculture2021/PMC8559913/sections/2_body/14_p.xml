Such investigations should be subject to best-available scientific analysis of potential risks and benefits. As do the US National Academies of Science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>), we consider that careful governance (with representation of all stakeholders and incorporating ethics and justice considerations for future generations) needs to be developed, and will be critical for determining what research, in what manner, and under what controls, such research may proceed.</p>
