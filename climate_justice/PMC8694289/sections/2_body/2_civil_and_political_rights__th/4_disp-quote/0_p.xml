<italic toggle="yes">The formulation and implementation of national health strategies and plans of action should respect, inter alia, the principles of non-discrimination and people&#8217;s participation. In particular, the right of individuals and groups to participate in decision-making processes, which may affect their development, must be an integral component of any policy, programme or strategy developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 12 [of the ICESCR]. Promoting health must involve effective community action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning, implementing and evaluating strategies to achieve better health. Effective provision of health services can only be assured if people&#8217;s participation is secured by States.</italic>
