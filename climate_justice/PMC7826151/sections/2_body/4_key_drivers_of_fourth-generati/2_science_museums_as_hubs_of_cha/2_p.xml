Janes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>) describes mindfulness as being fully in the moment, and paying deliberate and explicit attention to things, people, or events that are happening around us both locally and globally&#8212;occurrences we might otherwise ignore. It is about understanding what we choose to do, and our reasons why. Museum mindfulness does not imply that we let go of traditions that have historically sustained and characterized science museums worldwide. Instead, we must also take on the mantle of mindfulness to address larger issues and rethink science museums&#8217; identities and roles in contemporary societies.</p>
