Godfray et al. (2018) updated Nelson et al. (2016), a&#160;previous systematic review of the literature on environmental impacts associated with food, and concluded that higher consumption of animal-based foods was associated with higher estimated environmental impacts, whereas increased consumption of plant-based foods was associated with estimated lower environmental impact. Assessment of individual foods within these broader categories showed that meat&#160;&#8211; sometimes specified as ruminant meat (mainly beef)&#160;&#8211; was consistently identified as the single food with the greatest impact on the environment, most often in terms of GHG emissions and/or land use per unit commodity. Similar hierarchies, linked to well-known energy losses along trophic chains, from roots to beef were found in another recent review focussing exclusively on GHG emissions (Clune et al. 2017), and one on life-cycle assessments (Poore and Nemecek 2018). Poore and Nemecek (2018) amassed an extensive database that specifies both the hierarchy of emissions intensities and the variance with the production context (for example, by country and farming system).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="447.14"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 447.14; y1: 456.64; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.14" x1="313.26">The emissions intensities of red meat mean that its production has a&#160;disproportionate impact on total emissions (Godfray et al. 2018). For example, in the USA&#160;4% of food sold (by weight) is beef, which accounts for 36% of food-related emissions (Heller and Keoleian 2015). Food-related emissions are therefore very sensitive to the amount and type of meat consumed. However, 100&#160;g&#160;of beef has twice as much protein as the equivalent in cooked weight of beans, for example, and&#160;2.5 times more iron. One can ingest only about&#160;2.5&#160;kg of food per day and not all food items are as dense in nutrition.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="133.72" top="327.15"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 327.15; y1: 336.65; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="327.15" x1="133.72">There is therefore </span><span style="x0: 135.46; x1: 138.27; y0: 327.15; y1: 336.65; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="135.46" y0="327.15" x1="278.98">robust evidence with high agreement </span><span style="x0: 280.72; x1: 283.54; y0: 327.15; y1: 336.65; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="280.72" y0="327.15" x1="313.23">that the mixture of foods eaten can have a&#160;highly significant impact on per capita carbon emissions, driven particularly through the amount of (especially grain-fed) livestock and products. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.28" top="267.16"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.01; y0: 267.16; y1: 276.66; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="267.16" x1="313.28">Given the rising costs of malnutrition in all its forms, a&#160;legitimate question is often asked: would a&#160;diet that promotes health through good nutrition also be one that mitigates GHG emissions? Whilst sustainable diets need not necessarily provide more nutrition, there is certainly significant overlap between those that are healthier (e.g.,&#160;via eating more plant-based material and less livestock-based material), and eating the appropriate level of calories. In their systematic review, Nelson et al. (2016) conclude that, in general, a&#160;dietary pattern that is higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more health-promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact (GHG emissions and energy,&#160;land, and water use) than is the current average &#8216;meat-based&#8217; diet.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="99.18"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 99.18; y1: 108.68; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="99.18" x1="313.23">Recent FAO projections of food and agriculture to 2050 under alternative scenarios characterised by different degrees of sustainability, provide global-scale evidence that rebalancing diets is key to increasing the overall sustainability of food and agricultural </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="735.19"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.24; y0: 735.19; y1: 744.69; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.19" x1="571.77">systems world-wide.

This chapter expands on these key findings to document how mitigation in the entire food system, from farm gate to consumer, can contribute to reaching the stated global mitigation goals, but in a&#160;context of improved food security and nutrition. To put the range of mitigation potential of food systems in context, it is worth noting that emissions from crop and livestock are expected to increase by 30&#8211;40% from present to 2050, under business-as-usual scenarios that include efficiency improvements as well as dietary changes linked to increased income per capita (FAO 2018a; Tubiello et al. 2014).
