The UN&#8217;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&#160;represent a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for the global community (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2015</xref>), for instance. We agree with Coscieme et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>) and Ripple et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>) that the SDGs represent a global policy achievement of some significance. The pillars presented here add emphasis to core aspects of the policy response to sustainability, while themselves also incorporating and overarching the SDGs. The SDGs are designed such that no one goal is prioritized over others (UN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2015</xref>). While on the surface, this is a laudable recognition of the balanced priority afforded by the SDGs across economic, environmental and social domains, it nonetheless presents a somewhat flat understanding of the sustainability imperatives of the 21st century. The nature and pace of ecological degradation in particular, means that all of the SDGs are dependent on how successful or not measures to arrest the climate crisis are. We are now beginning to better understand that climate change makes existing poverty worse, leads to more inequality and results in more vulnerability.</p>
