(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021</xref>) reported that 53.1% of the world population has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine with just about 5% in low-income countries having received one dose. The COVID-19 vaccines global access (COVAX) programme was established for the primary purpose of vaccine accessibility for disadvantaged countries. Despite this, there is still a stark contrast in the statistics which points to a tremendous gap in vaccine equity. This is coming off the time when some of these developed countries have already proceeded to the booster jab phase, whilst the rest of the world is being left behind. It is an unclouded indication that the exercise is still largely prioritised rather than it being distributive. In the context of risk society theory, unequal access to the vaccine put everyone at risk and ensures that the disease persists for longer wrecking social, political, and economic havoc. The lack of capacity to produce vaccines locally will always leave the country vulnerable. This is like the impact of climate change, failure to curb it might aggravate local impacts, but the ripple effect will go beyond that locality.</p>
