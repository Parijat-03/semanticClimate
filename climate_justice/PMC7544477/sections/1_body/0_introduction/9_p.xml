<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0070">Before discussing my methodological approach to courtroom ethnography, the section below first provides some critical background to the fast-eroding public confidence around Canadian government &#8220;climate leadership&#8221; during the pipeline and settler-colonial &#8220;court justice&#8221; sagas of 2018&#8211;2020. It sets the stage for so-called threats that would be talked about &#8211; peaceful Indigenous youth who would become framed as &#8220;criminally contemptuous&#8221; and grandmothers who became &#8220;sinister seniors&#8221; in the media and sent to prison. I then discuss orientations for a courtroom ethnography and bring critical scrutiny to experiences of one particular injunction protecting TMX. Section <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> then interrogates the court's theatre of power operating to advance fossil fuel extractivism through contemporary colonial rituals. In section <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, considering diverse affects and dramas surrounding contested deployment of the term &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; in the courtroom, I turn to some of the defendants' challenges to the court, including an eventual theatrical reproduction of courtroom dramas in a play entitled &#8220;<italic>Irreparable harm?&#8221;</italic> &#8211;and reconfigured public debates on injunctions in 2020 that put Canada's colonialism under new spotlights. I conclude by asking what it means for geographers to study court challenges to colonial violence and hegemonies, engaging an ethics of care.</p>
