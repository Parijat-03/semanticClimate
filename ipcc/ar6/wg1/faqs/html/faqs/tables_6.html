      <td>Yes, much better. The first IPCC report, released in 1990, concluded that human-caused climate change would\nsoon become evident, but could not yet confirm that it was already happening. Today, evidence is overwhelming\nthat the climate has indeed changed since the pre-industrial era and that human activities are the principal cause\nof that change. With much more data and better models, we also understand more about how the atmosphere\ninteracts with the ocean, ice, snow, ecosystems and land surfaces of the Earth.

New satellite\ninstruments have also provided a wealth of increasingly fine-grained data. Additional data from older observing\nsystems and even hand-written historical records are still being incorporated into observational datasets, and\nthese datasets are now better integrated and adjusted for historical changes in instruments and measurement\ntechniques.

An important test of models is their ability to simulate Earth&#8217;s climate over the period\nof instrumental records (since about 1850). Several rounds of such testing have taken place since 1990, and\nthe testing itself has become much more rigorous and extensive. As a group and at large scales, models have\npredicted the observed changes well in these tests (FAQ 3.3).
