<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The discussion section acknowledges that no matter how sophisticated, tools like CES, SVI, and HHAI are, they are best used as screening methods (indeed, there is a tool by developed for the California Air Resources Board called the Environmental Justice Screening Method &#8211; see above report by Jim Sadd) that can flag areas that require more in-depth and ground-level assessment. While this is expensive to implement, it is important for public agencies not to rely solely on these &#8220;30,000 foot&#8221; models and instead commitment to on-site ground-truthing. This point could made more strongly and in the introduction instead of only at the end of the paper.</p>
