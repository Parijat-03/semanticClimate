(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>) has mapped the ceiling(s) to resource use, considering global ecological limits and carrying capacity. The &#8216;safe operating space&#8217; can be applied to identify clear resource and emissions caps, and to establish performance targets and policy measures in response to identified global environmental pressures (Rockstr&#246;m et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>; Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>; Hjalsted et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). However, much of the world&#8217;s population face a lack of access to resources (UNDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>).</p>
