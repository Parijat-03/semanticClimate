<p>We cannot separate the relational and critical so we now move to explore what we term a
&#8216;critical-relational&#8217; approach. The nexus between the two terms explores how we
build purposeful, meaningful and helpful relationships with people, whilst coming from a
&#8216;critical&#8217; standpoint. Through relational practices and a process of dialogue
with groups and communities, trust, mutuality and respect is central to praxis, and oppressive
structures and practices in society are critically examined to find more egalitarian,
supportive and sustainable alternatives (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Freire, 1972</xref>;
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ledwith, 2011</xref>). A critical-relational paradigm
insists social workers avoid doing things &#8216;to&#8217; community members/citizens, or
&#8216;for&#8217; them such as when in a service role, but rather works &#8216;with&#8217;
participants, enabling a journey of community-led support and change. In this regard, social
work is a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; practice that is led by the people with whom we are
working.</p>
