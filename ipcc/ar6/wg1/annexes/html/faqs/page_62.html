We now know that the ways in which average and extreme conditions have changed (and will continue to change) depend on the variable and the phenomenon being considered. Changes in local surface temperature extremes closely follow the corresponding changes in local average surface temperatures. On the contrary, changes in precipitation extremes (heavy precipitation) generally do not follow those in average precipitation, and can even move in the opposite direction (e.g.,&#160;with average precipitation decreasing but extreme precipitation increasing).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="564.22"><span x0="69.02" y0="564.22" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 564.22; y1: 573.22; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate change will manifest very differently depending on which region, season and variable we are interested in. For example, over some parts of the Arctic, temperatures will warm at rates about three to four times higher during winter compared to summer months. And in summer, most of northern Europe will experience larger temperatures increases than most places in south-east South America and Australasia, with differences that can be larger than 1&#176;C, depending on the level of global warming. In general, differences across regions and seasons arise because the underlying physical processes differ drastically across regions and seasons.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="486.24"><span x0="69.02" y0="486.24" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 486.24; y1: 495.24; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate change will also manifest differently for different weather regimes and can lead to contrasting changes in average and extreme conditions. Observations of the recent past and climate model projections show that, in most places, changes in daily temperatures are dominated by a&#160;general warming where the climatological average and extreme values are shifted towards higher temperatures, making warm extremes more frequent and cold extremes less frequent. The top panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure&#160;1&#160;show projected changes in surface temperature for long-term average conditions (left) and for extreme hot days (right) during the warm season (summer in mid- to high latitudes). Projected increases in long-term average temperature differ substantially between different places, varying from less than 3&#176;C in some places in central South Asia and southern South America to over 7&#176;C in some places in North America, North Africa and the Middle East. Changes in extreme hot days follow changes in average conditions quite closely, although, in some places, the warming rates for extremes can be intensified (e.g.,&#160;southern Europe and the Amazon basin) or weakened (e.g.,&#160;northern Asia and Greenland) compared to average values.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.83" top="336.27"><span x0="69.02" y0="336.27" x1="539.83" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 336.27; y1: 345.27; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Recent observations and global and regional climate model projections point to changes in precipitation extremes (including both rainfall and snowfall extremes) differing drastically from those in average precipitation. The bottom panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure&#160;1&#160;show projected changes in the long-term average precipitation (left) and in heavy precipitation (right). Averaged precipitation changes show striking regional differences, with substantial drying in places such as southern Europe and northern South America and wetting in places such as the Middle East and southern South America. Changes in extreme precipitation are much more uniform, with systematic increases over nearly all land regions. The physical reasons behind the different responses of averaged and extreme precipitation are now well understood. The intensification of extreme precipitation is driven by the increase in atmospheric water vapour (about 7% per 1&#176;C of warming near the surface), although this is modulated by various dynamical changes. In contrast, changes in average precipitation are driven not only by moisture increases but also by slower processes that constrain future changes over the globe to only 2&#8211;3% per 1&#176;C of warming near the surface.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.84" top="186.31"><span x0="69.02" y0="186.31" x1="539.84" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 71.53; y0: 186.31; y1: 195.31; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In summary, the specific relationship between changes in average and extreme conditions strongly depends on the variable or phenomenon being considered. At the local scale, average and extreme surface temperature changes are strongly related, while average and extreme precipitation changes are often weakly related. For both variables, the changes in average and extreme conditions vary strongly across different places due to the effect of local and regional processes.</span></div></body></html>
