For example, excessive greenhouse gas emissions lead to more polluted air, with implications for acute and chronic respiratory disease; droughts, melting glaciers and climate-related natural disasters such as fires are already impacting food production. The impact of climate change on livelihoods is forecast to cause large-scale societal disruptions and exacerbated inequities, and result in population migration, poverty and poorer health. As such, the climate crisis will have a major effect on both health and life expectancy.</p>
