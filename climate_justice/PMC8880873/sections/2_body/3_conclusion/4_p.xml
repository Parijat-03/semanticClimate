<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sometimes wind potential remains untapped because utilities find that wind facilities produce electricity intermittently, specifically, only when there is a sufficient wind flow. The problem is accentuated when there is a mispatch between electricity generation and peak electricity demand. For example, there might be demand surge in the evening when people return home, start their appliances and charge their cars. But if wind flows are feeble during the evening, there is excess demand for electricity. This means wind systems require back-ups to meet the peak demand, which often is provided by gas-fired turbines. Scholars note that the rapid technological improvements in battery storage could address this issue [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Wind turbines could generate electricity when the wind flow is strong and store the excess electricity in batteries. When electricity demand peaks, utilities could draw electricity from these batteries even when wind turbines might not be functioning. Future research should track how decreases in battery storage costs might help improve the economics of wind energy and therefore wind penetration in tribal areas.</p>
