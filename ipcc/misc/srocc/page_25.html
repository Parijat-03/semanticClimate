Therefore, SSPs can be consistent with different levels of global mean surface temperature rise as projected by different SSP-RCP combinations. However, some SSP-RCP combinations are not possible; for instance RCP2.6 and lower levels of future global mean surface temperature rise (e.g., 1.5&#186;C) are not possible in SSP3 in modelled pathways. {1.2.2, 6.1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}</span></div></body></html>
