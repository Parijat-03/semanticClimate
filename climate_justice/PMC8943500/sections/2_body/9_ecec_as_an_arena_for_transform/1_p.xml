A growing body of research shows that ECEC settings are arenas for ECEfS. However, these examples are seldom recognised in national or global reviews. Furthermore, the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP) has since 2008 run world projects for sustainable development in early childhood (Engdahl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). Since 2008, OMEP national committees have participated in 1200 ESD projects in 35 countries reaching 150,000 young children (birth&#8212;8&#160;years old), 15,500 early childhood teachers and 12,500 families in 4 200 local communities. These practices and pedagogies towards sustainability lean on children&#8217;s empowerment and agency. This involvement makes a difference and shows the great number of teachers and children who do address ECEfS.</p>
