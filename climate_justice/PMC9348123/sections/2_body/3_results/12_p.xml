Cluster analysis is a methodology for the task of assigning a set of objects into groups so that the objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than those in other clusters. The Clauset&#8208;Newman&#8208;Moore cluster algorithm is one of the best methods for big data analysis.<xref rid="hpm3500-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">

In the children's networks, Amalina (D1) and Zo&#235; Hyde (D2) are located in the centre of group 1 and group 3, respectively (see Figure 5). UNICEF (O1), World Health Organisation (O2), and Henrietta H. Fore (R1) play an essential role in group 2. While group 1 tends to communicate with others within the group, group 2 and group 3 actively communicate with other groups.</p>
