Continued inaction reduces the future policy option space, dampens economic growth and increases the challenges of mitigation as well as adaptation (Moore and Diaz 2015; Luderer et al. 2013). The cost of reducing emissions is estimated to be considerably less than the costs of the damages at all levels (Kainuma et&#160;al.&#160;2013; Moran 2011; S&#225;nchez and Maseda 2016).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.64" top="579.53"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 579.53; y1: 589.03; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="579.53" x1="557.64">The costs of adapting to climate impacts are also projected to be substantial, although evidence is limited (summarised in Chambwera et al. 2014a). Estimates range from 9&#160;to 166&#160;billion&#160;USD per year at various scales and types of adaptation, from capacity building to speci&#64257;c projects (Fankhauser 2017). There is insuf&#64257;cient literature about the costs of adaptation in the agriculture or land-based sectors (Wreford and Renwick 2012) due to lack of baselines, uncertainty around biological relationships and&#160;inherent uncertainty about anticipated avoided damage estimates, but economic appraisal of actions to maintain the functions&#160;of the natural environment and land sector generate positive net present values (Adaptation Sub-committee 2013).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.58" top="495.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.94; y0: 495.54; y1: 505.04; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="495.54" x1="557.58">Preventing land degradation from occurring is considered more cost-effective in the long term compared to the magnitude of resources required to restore already degraded land (Cowie et al. 2018a) (Section&#160;3.6.1). Evidence from drylands shows that each US dollar invested in land restoration provides between 3&#160;and 6&#160;USD in social returns over a&#160;30-year period, using a&#160;discount rate between&#160;2.5 and 10% (Nkonya et al. 2016). SLM practices reverse or minimise economic losses of land degradation, estimated at&#160;between&#160;6.3 and 10.6&#160;trillion&#160;USD annually, (ELD Initiative 2015) more than &#64257;ve times the entire value of agriculture in the market economy (Costanza et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2017; Sandifer et al. 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2013) (Section&#160;3.7.5).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.65" top="411.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 411.55; y1: 421.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="411.55" x1="557.65">Across other areas such as food security, disaster mitigation and risk reduction, humanitarian response, and healthy diet (to&#160;address&#160;malnutrition as well as disease), early action generates economic bene&#64257;ts greater than costs (</span><span style="x0: 482.64; x1: 487.22; y0: 399.55; y1: 409.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="482.64" y0="399.55" x1="557.63">high evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 118.05; x1: 120.69; y0: 387.55; y1: 397.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="118.05" y0="387.55" x1="557.53">) (Fankhauser 2017; Wilkinson et al. 2018; Venton 2018; Venton et al. 2012; Clarvis et al. 2015; Nugent et al. 2018; Watts&#160;et al. 2018; Bertram et al. 2018) (Sections&#160;6.3 and 6.4).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="242.71" top="351.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.97; y0: 351.42; y1: 361.42; width: 2.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="351.42" x1="242.71">iv.

An emerging trend is towards new frameworks that will enable multiple decision-makers with multiple objectives to explore the trade-offs between potentially con&#64258;icting preferences to identify strategies that are robust to deep uncertainties (Singh et al. 2015; Driscoll et al. 2016; Araujo Enciso et al. 2016; Herman et al. 2014; P&#233;rez et al. 2016; Girard et al. 2015; Haasnoot et al. 2018; Roelich and Giesekam 2019).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="424.14" top="243.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 85.11; y0: 243.42; y1: 253.42; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="243.42" x1="424.14">Valuation of bene&#64257;ts and damages and costing interventions: Measurement issues</span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.47; y0: 231.52; y1: 241.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="231.52" x1="557.65">Cost appraisal tools for climate adaptation are many and their suitability depends on the context (Section&#160;7.5.2.2). Cost-bene&#64257;t analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are commonly applied, especially for current climate variability situations. However, these tools are not without criticism and their limitations have been observed in the literature (see Rogelj et al. 2018). In general, measuring costs and providing valuations are in&#64258;uenced by four conditions: measurement and valuation; the time dimension; externalities; and aggregate versus marginal costs.</span></div><div left="79.37" right="207.65" top="159.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 87.52; y0: 159.42; y1: 169.42; width: 8.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="159.42" x1="207.65">Measurement and value issues</span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.77; y0: 147.52; y1: 157.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="147.52" x1="557.65">ES not traded in the market fall outside the formal or market-based valuation and so their value is either not accounted for or&#160;underestimated in both private and public decisions (Atkinson et al. 2018). Environmental valuation literature uses a&#160;range of techniques to assign monetary values to environmental outcomes where no market exists (Atkinson et al. 2018; Dallimer et al. 2018), but some values remain inestimable. For some indigenous cultures and peoples, land is not considered something that can&#160;be&#160;sold and bought, so economic valuations are not meaningful even as proxy approaches (Boillat and Berkes 2013; Kumpula&#160;et&#160;al. 2011; Pert et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2005).</span></div></body></html>
