But the link between climate change and land is also inherently political, a reality that does not come out sufficiently clear enough in IPCC reports. For example, reduced annual rainfall in a microregion is likely to have a differential impact upon socially differentiated communities engaged in the spheres of agriculture and food production, circulation, exchange and consumption, where some are likely to lose out and become impoverished, while a handful of others may accelerate and expand capital accumulation (see e.g. Watts, <xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>/<xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Ch. 7). An extreme weather disturbance might expel fisher-farmers from their land near the seashore, while a real estate and hotel conglomerate grabs their land (Uson, <xref rid="CIT0100" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is not uncommon for ordinary poor people to lose their productive assets (access to land, forest, herd, house) not because of the extreme weather disturbance itself, but because of coercion deployed by the state and powerful elites who take advantage of the disaster &#8211; what Klein (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) calls &#8216;disaster capitalism&#8217;.</p>
