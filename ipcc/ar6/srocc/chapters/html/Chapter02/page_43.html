Emigration has increased in recent decades from two valleys in highland Bolivia which rely on glacier melt water, as water supplies have declined, though other factors also contribute to emigration, including land fragmentation, increasing household needs for income, the lack of local wage-labour opportunities and an interest among the young in educational opportunities located in cities (Brandt et al., 2016). In Nepal, young members of high-elevation pastoral households impacted by cryosphere change have been increasingly engaged in tourism and labour migration since 2000 (Shaoliang et al., 2012); similar responses are reported for Sikkim in the Indian Himalaya (Ingty, 2017). A recent study documents the inter-generational dynamics of emigration from a livestock raising community in the Peruvian Andes, where glacier retreat has led to reduced stream&#64258;ow that supports crucial dry season pasture (Alata et al., 2018). Though people 50 years old or older in this community are accustomed to living in the high pasture zones, younger people use livestock raising as a means of accumulating capital. They sell off their animals and move to towns at lower elevations. This loss of young adults has reduced the capacity of households to undertake the most demanding tasks, particularly in periods of inclement weather, accelerating the decline of herding. As a result, the human and animal populations of the communities are shrinking.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.97" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.84; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="447.56" x1="312.97">Recent research on cryosphere driven migration shows some cases of complex livelihood interactions or feedback loops, in which migration is not merely a result of changes in agricultural livelihoods, but also has impacts, either positive or negative, on these livelihoods (</span><span style="x0: 110.12; x1: 116.98; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="110.12" y0="399.56" x1="182.25">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 182.25; x1: 184.89; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="182.25" y0="399.56" x1="184.89">)</span><span style="x0: 184.89; x1: 187.17; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="184.89" y0="399.56" x1="189.45">. </span><span style="x0: 191.22; x1: 193.51; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="191.22" y0="399.56" x1="312.94">In some instances, the different livelihood strategies complement each other to support income and well-being. A review of migration in the Himalaya and Hindu Kush found that households that participated in labour migration and received remittances had improved adaptive capacity, and lowered exposure to natural hazards (Banerjee et al., 2018). In other cases, the households and communities, which undertake wage labour migration, encounter con&#64258;icts or incompatibilities between migration and agricultural livelihoods. Sustainable management of land, water and other resources is highly labour intensive, and hence labour mobility constrains and limits the adoption of sustainable practices (Gilles et al., 2013). Moreover, the labour available to a household is differentiated by age. In Northern Pakistan, where cryosphere changes are reducing stream&#64258;ow the emigration of young people has led to a decline not only in the labour in &#64257;elds and orchards, but also a decline in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, leading to an overall reduction of the agricultural livelihoods in the community (Parveen et al., 2015).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.94" top="171.59"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 171.59; y1: 181.09; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="171.59" x1="312.94">In addition to affecting pastoral transhumance and increasing wage labour migration, cryosphere changes impact human mobility by creating cases of displacement. These cases differ from wage labour migration because they involve entire communities. As a result, they are irreversible, unlike cases in which individuals undertake long-term or permanent migration from their communities but retain the possibility of returning, because, for example, some relatives or former neighbours have remained in place. In this way, these cases of displacement represent cryosphere driven challenges to habitability. Though natural hazards have historically led some communities </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.46" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 326.25; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.61" x1="571.46">to relocate, cryosphere changes have contributed to instances of displacement. Unreliable water availability and increased risks of natural hazards are responsible for resettlement of villages in certain high mountain areas (McDonald, 1989; Parveen et al., 2015). A village in Western Nepal moved to lower elevation after decreasing snowfall reduced the &#64258;ow of water in the river on which their pastoralism and agriculture depended (Barnett et al., 2005). Three villages in Nepal faced severe declines in agricultural and pastoral livelihoods because decreased snow cover led to reduced soil moisture and to the drying up of springs, which were the historical source of irrigation water; in conjunction with an international non-governmental organisation (INGO), the residents planned a move to a lower area (Prasain, 2018). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.46" top="579.63"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.65; y0: 579.63; y1: 589.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="579.63" x1="571.46">The issue of habitability arises in the cases, mentioned above, of communities that relocate after &#64258;oods or debris &#64258;ows destroy houses and irrigation infrastructure, or damage &#64257;elds and pastures. It occurs as well in the cases of households with extensive long-term migration, where agricultural and pastoral livelihoods are undermined by reduced water supply caused by cryospheric change (Barnett et al., 2005). In addition, the loss of cultural values, including spiritual and intrinsic values (Section&#160;2.3.6), can contribute to decisions to migrate (Kaenzig, 2015). Combined with the patterns of permanent emigration, this issue of habitability raises the issue of limits to adaptation in mountain areas (Huggel et al., 2019). Projections of decreased stream&#64258;ow by 2100 in watersheds with strong glacier melt water components in Asia, Europe, and North and South America (Section&#160;2.3.1.1) indicate that threats to habitability may continue through this period and affect the endeavours of achieving the SDGs in developing countries (Rasul et al., 2019).</span></div><div left="323.43" right="550.22" top="363.01"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 329.67; y0: 363.01; y1: 375.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLHNB+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.43" y0="363.01" x1="550.22">2.4 International Policy Frameworks and Pathways to Sustainable Development</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.52" top="327.52"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 327.52; y1: 337.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="327.52" x1="571.52">The governance of key resources that are affected by climate-related changes in the cryosphere, such as water, is a relevant aspect for climate resilient sustainable development in mountains at the catchment level (Section&#160;2.3.1.4).
