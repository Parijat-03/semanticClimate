As this trainee is a non-Indigenous social worker practicing in Indigenous communities, this adaptability is a critical part of her daily routine. The GSW training assists her in learning from Indigenous sustainability practices, building her adaptability to develop custom-specific strategies that promote the Indigenous community&#8217;s environmental health and well-being where she works. Indeed, through case studies of Indigenous activities that serve environmental protection and climate change mitigation, the student has discovered that many Indigenous communities have standard practices of respect and caring for mother earth, for example, cultural burning (Indigenous fire practices) to better the ecosystem [<xref rid="B63-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This practice was once scrutinized by Western standards but has been recognized as an effective intervention to revitalize an ecosystem through safe practicing [<xref rid="B64-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A healthy ecosystem, in turn, supports and fulfills inhabitants and co-inhabitants&#8217; diverse needs, further contributing to their health and well-being because human health, animal welfare, and our shared environment are closely connected [<xref rid="B65-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. As this student is learning from the Indigenous community context models, obtaining the community-based knowledge, traditions, and skills enhances the social workers&#8217; adaptability in general. It is an excellent means to advance the ecological, social, cultural, and health dimensions in community development. </p>
