<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Therefore, the final sample for Study 1 comprised 174 participants: 91 females and 83 males (age <italic>M</italic> = 49.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.5, range = 16&#8211;80 years). Two &#967;<sup>2</sup>-tests for goodness of fit for age groups and gender, respectively, found no significant deviation from the proportions set for the recruiting procedure, either for gender, &#967;<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.544 or for age group, &#967;<sup>2</sup>(5) = 2.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.751. The resulting sample therefore still represents the distribution of age and gender in the German population as a whole.</p>
