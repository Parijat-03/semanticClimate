It is dif&#64257;cult to precisely identify its start and end. It is usually&#160;slow and gradual (Wilhite and Pulwarty 2017), but sometimes can evolve rapidly (Ford and Labosier 2017; Mo and Lettenmaier 2015). It is context-dependent, but its impacts are diffuse, both direct and indirect, short-term and long-term (Few&#160;and&#160;Tebboth 2018; Wilhite and Pulwarty 2017). Following the Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), drought is de&#64257;ned here as &#8220;a&#160;period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a&#160;serious hydrological imbalance&#8221; (Mach et al. 2014). Although drought is considered abnormal relative to the water availability under the mean climatic characteristics, it is also a&#160;recurrent element of any climate, not only in drylands, but also in humid areas (Cook et al. 2014b; Seneviratne and Ciais 2017; Spinoni et al. 2019; T&#252;rke&#351; 1999; Wilhite et al. 2014). Climate change is projected to increase the intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions across the world (for a&#160;detailed assessment see Section&#160;2.2, and IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of&#160;1.5&#176;C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018)). Droughts often amplify the effects of unsustainable land management practices, especially in drylands, leading to land degradation (Cook et al. 2009; Hornbeck 2012). Especially in the context of climate change, the recurrent nature of droughts requires proactively planned policy instruments both to be well-prepared&#160;to respond to droughts when they occur and also undertake </span><span style="x0: 432.76; x1: 436.98; y0: 531.54; y1: 541.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="432.76" y0="531.54" x1="461.94">ex ante </span><span style="x0: 462.3; x1: 466.69; y0: 531.54; y1: 541.04; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="462.3" y0="531.54" x1="551.97">actions to mitigate their impacts by&#160;strengthening societal resilience against droughts (Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="275.66" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.15; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="495.55" x1="275.66">Droughts are among the costliest of natural hazards (</span><span style="x0: 275.69; x1: 278.5; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="275.69" y0="495.55" x1="333.94">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 333.97; x1: 336.25; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="333.97" y0="495.55" x1="338.21">, </span><span style="x0: 339.31; x1: 343.89; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="339.31" y0="495.55" x1="397.53">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 397.56; x1: 400.2; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="397.56" y0="495.55" x1="551.91">). According to the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT), droughts affected more than&#160;1.1&#160;billion people between 1994 and 2013, with the recorded global economic damage of 787&#160;billion USD (CRED 2015), corresponding to an average of 41.4&#160;billion USD per year. Drought losses in the agricultural sector alone in developing countries were estimated to equal 29&#160;billion USD between 2005 and 2015 (FAO 2018). Usually, these estimates capture only direct and on-site costs of droughts. However, droughts have also wide-ranging indirect and off-site impacts, which are seldom quanti&#64257;ed. These indirect impacts are both biophysical and socio-economic, with poor households and communities being particularly exposed to them (Winsemius et al. 2018). Droughts affect not only water quantity, but also water quality (Mosley 2014). The costs of these water quality impacts are yet to be adequately quanti&#64257;ed. Socio-economic indirect impacts of droughts are related to food insecurity, poverty, lowered health and displacement (Gray and Mueller 2012; Johnstone and Mazo 2011; Linke et al. 2015; Lohmann and Lechtenfeld 2015; Maystadt and Ecker 2014; Yusa et al. 2015) (Section&#160;3.4.2.9 and&#160;Box&#160;5.5), which are dif&#64257;cult to quantify comprehensively. Research is required for developing methodologies that could allow for more comprehensive assessment of these indirect drought costs. Such methodologies require the collection of highly granular data, which&#160;is currently lacking in many countries due to high costs of data collection. However, the opportunities provided by remotely sensed data and novel analytical methods based on big data and arti&#64257;cial intelligence, including use of citizen science for data collection, could help in reducing these gaps. </span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.94" top="303.57"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 303.57; y1: 313.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="303.57" x1="551.94">There are three broad (and sometimes overlapping) policy approaches for responding to droughts (Section&#160;7.4.8). These approaches are often pursued simultaneously by many governments. Firstly, responding to drought when it occurs by providing direct drought relief, known as crisis management. Crisis management is also the costliest among policy approaches to droughts because it often incentivises the continuation of activities vulnerable to droughts (Botterill and Hayes 2012; Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.86" top="243.58"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 243.58; y1: 253.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="243.58" x1="551.86">The second approach involves development of drought preparedness plans, which coordinate the policies for providing relief measures when droughts occur. For example, combining resources to respond to droughts at regional level in Sub-Saharan Africa was found to be more cost-effective than separate individual country drought relief funding (Clarke and Hill 2013). Effective drought preparedness plans require well-coordinated and integrated government actions&#160;&#8211; a key lesson learnt from 2015 to 2017 during drought response in Cape Town, South Africa (Visser 2018). Reliable, relevant and timely climate and weather information helps respond to droughts appropriately (Sivakumar and Ndiang&#8217;ui 2007). Improved knowledge and integration of weather and climate information can be achieved by strengthening drought early warning systems at different scales (Verbist et al. 2016). Every&#160;USD invested into strengthening hydro-meteorological and early warning services in developing countries was found to yield between 4&#160;and 35 USD (Hallegatte 2012). Improved access and coverage by drought insurance, including index insurance, can help alleviate the impacts of droughts on livelihoods (Guerrero-Baena et al. 2019; Kath et al. 2019; Osgood et al. 2018; Ruiz et al. 2015; Tadesse&#160;et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.91" top="111.6"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 111.6; y1: 121.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="111.6" x1="551.91">The third category of responses to droughts involves drought risk mitigation. Drought risk mitigation is a&#160;set of proactive measures, policies and management activities aimed at reducing the future impacts of droughts (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2012).
