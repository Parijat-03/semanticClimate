<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Data analytics methodologies are widely used in research across scientific disciplines to assess and analyze current domain-related practices and scientific activities. For these purposes, big volumes of input data can be found in domain-specific archives but also in general web and social media sources. The contribution of CS projects and activities to generating and providing such data collections has been characterized by Poisson et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) for the area of geographic information systems and by Tang et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) for environmental big data. However, few efforts have been made to facilitate such approaches for analyzing the CS landscape as a whole, broadening our knowledge on the scope and state of CS to date. This is the perspective taken by the CS Track project.</p>
