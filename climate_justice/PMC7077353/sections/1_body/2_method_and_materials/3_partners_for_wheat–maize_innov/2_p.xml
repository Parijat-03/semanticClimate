<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">When the RDRS started its partnership with CIMMYT, it selected individuals who had proven successful experience in earlier agricultural innovation processes. RDRS targeted farmers with whom they had strong existing relationships and who were considered enthusiastic and willing to try out wheat&#8211;maize innovations. The amount of land deemed necessary for wheat&#8211;maize innovation varies across communities, but in Kalipara RDRS stipulated that participating farmers should farm at least 20 decimals (.08 hectare), whether owned or hired in. The land had to be upland, situated next to a road in order to maximise visibility of the trials and because when machinery is driven to more remote locations, fuel costs more &#8211; thus making them unattractive to farmers at the early adoption stage. Potential participants also needed to have a minimum level of education. These criteria automatically excluded most low-income women and men, the majority of whom have never been targeted by RDRS or the government agricultural services. Even so, a few low-income Muslim men known to RDRS were targeted.</p>
