<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par21">Contemporary discourses on relational ontology in Western thought were identified as belonging to speculative realism, process philosophy, and new materialism. Speculative realism (hereafter SR) is a heterogenous body of thought in which various philosophies posit very different alternatives to the bifurcation of nature/culture and the anti-realism of modern Enlightenment philosophy. SR&#8217;s core commitments are to a renewed willingness to entertain speculative metaphysics and ontological realism in an attempt to overcome the problem of <italic>correlationism</italic>. As most famously described by Kant, correlationism posits that an object cannot be known outside its relationship to the mind, such that knowledge of reality is always a correlation between thinking and being (Bryant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). SR seeks various ways to describe reality outside this contradiction.</p>
