<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">Air pollution is usually the emission of pollutants from internal combustion engines, factories, and other natural and human activities. According to the WHO, air pollution kills 7 million people annually worldwide. A typical engine combustion reaction (fuel + air (nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)&#160;+&#160;oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>))) may emit the following gases: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) (including nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and nitric oxide (NO)), and volatile organic compounds, which may be toxic to human respiratory systems or serve as precursors to toxins (such as O<sub>3</sub>). Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), emitted from engines and all other combustion processes, and N<sub>2</sub>O and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) are gaseous pollutants that contribute to global warming. Also emitted from engines are respirable particulate matter.<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), another widespread air pollution problem that, along with NO<sub>2</sub>, contributes to acid rain, is usually released from processes that require combustion of coal combustion.</p>
