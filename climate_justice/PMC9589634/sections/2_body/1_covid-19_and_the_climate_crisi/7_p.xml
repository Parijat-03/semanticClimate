For example, the Fridays for Future movement uses the term &#8216;climate emergency&#8217; in its public communication (Fridays for Future n.d.). The same applies to the global climate justice movement Extinction Rebellion, whose logo, a pictogram of an hourglass, emphasizes the aspect of lack of time. Increasingly, this rhetoric is also used with appellative intent in the scientific community (Lenton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>; Ripple et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). The goal of such framing is to get governments and the public to view the climate crisis as an emergency and to &#8216;[u]nite behind the science&#8217; (Fridays for Future <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>) in order to take quick political action based on scientific evidence.</p>
