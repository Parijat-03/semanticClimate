by social movements, NGOs, research institutions and other supporting organizations
from the eight schools participating in this collective reflexion, as well as many
others across the region. Although not all these pedagogic experiences call
themselves &#8220;schools&#8221;, many self-identify as such in recognition of their alignment
with the foundational work of Paulo Freire.<sup>(<xref rid="fn13-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">13</xref>)</sup> It is the practice of critical
pedagogy, with its ethical and political intentions, that is key to re-signifying
where popular urbanism learning happens and how it works. As critiqued by
Giroux,<sup>(<xref rid="fn14-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">14</xref>)</sup> the school, as the main social instrument and space devoted to
education, has become over time an instrument of students&#8217; social assimilation
rather than a space to engage critically with society and strengthen capacities to
change it. Adhering to this critique, the work of the schools discussed in this
paper encapsulate a conscious effort towards reclaiming the emancipatory power of
popular education.</p>
