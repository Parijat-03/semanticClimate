Specifically, we employed the GTWR models to examine how different factors, including the COVID&#8208;19 outbreaks, wildfires, air quality, and drought, drove the following three metrics that describe human recreation and mobility at public parks: (a) the number of visits per capita, (b) the median of minimum dwell time they spent at the park, and (c) the median travel distance to parks.</p>
