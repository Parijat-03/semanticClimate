Trudeau branded himself a feminist and climate policy leader, and committed publicly to respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). His government's actions around pipelines in 2017 and thereafter displayed what many saw as disappointing breaches of campaign pledges. The National Energy Board (NEB) &#8211; an industry-focused entity empowered to adjudicate the legitimacy and risks of energy-related projects &#8211; became a tool of continuity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Hunsberger &amp; Aw&#226;sis, 2019</xref>). Trudeau's campaign pledge to overhaul the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for all projects including the Trans Mountain Pipeline did not materialise, while his promoting new fossil fuel infrastructure led to Canada being talked about as among the worst environmental criminals on the global stage (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">McKibben, 2017</xref>).</p>
