Long-term (&gt;90 years) rainfall trends are mixed in sign, location-dependent, and weak (Kruger and Nxumalo, 2017; Wolski et&#160;al., 2021); mid-term (about 50 years) trends are similarly mixed in sign (MacKellar et&#160;al., 2014). In the south-western part of the region, rainfall is mostly decreasing in the post 1981 period, particularly in December&#8211;January&#8211;February and March&#8211;April&#8211;May, although there is no trend or a&#160;weak wetting in June&#8211;July&#8211;August (Sousa et&#160;al., 2018a; Wolski et&#160;al., 2021). Rainfall trends of similar magnitude and duration to the post-1981 trend accompanied previous strong droughts in the region (Wolski et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="173.97" top="558.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="558.48" x1="173.97" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 558.48; y1: 568.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.3 Observational Issues</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="534.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="534.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">South Africa and the Cape Town region have good instrumental weather data. Records start in the late 1800s, with in excess of 10&#160;gauges reporting since the 1920s, expanding to about 80&#160;gauges in the 1980s, but the number of stations has declined since. The mountains have only a&#160;few stations, which receive more than 1000&#160;mm per year. In view of the strong heterogeneity of rainfall, changes in the number of stations contributing to datasets such as Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Project results in a&#160;lack of consistency between them, which limits their reliability in the region (Section&#160;10.2; Wolski et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="263.02" top="402.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="402.48" x1="263.02" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.4 Relevant Anthropogenic and Natural Drivers</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.71" top="378.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="378.6" x1="304.71" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Because the primary rainfall mechanism is frontal rain, the most relevant large-scale drivers are those that affect cyclogenesis, frontogenesis and the mid-latitude westerlies&#8217; latitudinal position and moisture supply. These drivers and, thus, the region&#8217;s rainfall are linked to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO; Reason and Rouault, 2005) or Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant monthly and interannual mode of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric variability, and a&#160;measure of the pressure gradient between mid- and high latitudes. (See Sections 3.3, 3.7, 4.3 and Annex IV.2.2 for more general discussion of the SAM.) While in the post-1930 period, the SAM displays a&#160;long-term positive trend, the Cape Town region&#8217;s rainfall does not, and only the post-1979 trends of rainfall and SAM&#160;are conceptually consistent. For example, a&#160;positive trend in the SAM is associated with a&#160;negative trend in rainfall (Section&#160;10.6.2.5 and Figure&#160;10.18). There is also good agreement between the seasonality of the SAM and rainfall trends in the post-1979 period: a&#160;drying trend appears strongly in December to February and March to May, but not in June to August and September to November (Wolski et&#160;al., 2021), and trends in the SAM have similar seasonal dependence (E.-P. Lim et&#160;al., 2016; Section&#160;3.7.2). Additionally, there is a&#160;similar seasonal pattern in the post-1979 trends in indices capturing the southern edge of the Hadley circulation (Grise et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="102.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="102.6" x1="304.73" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 58.99; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the longer-term, Cape Town regional rainfall is characterized by a&#160;multi-decadal scale quasi-periodicity (Figure&#160;10.18; Dieppois et&#160;al., 2019; Wolski et&#160;al., 2021), with the 2015&#8211;2017 drought and previous strong droughts (1930s and 1970s) occurring during the rainfall&#8217;s periodic low phases. However, the studies linking the Cape Town </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">SAM (Sousa et&#160;al., 2018a; Burls et&#160;al., 2019; Mahlalela et&#160;al., 2019) focused almost exclusively on the post-1979 period, when global reanalyses are available. Detailed understanding of the drivers of previous (1930s and 1970s) Cape Town region droughts and the role of hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM in the pre-1979 period is missing.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.29" top="630.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="630.6" x1="563.29" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 630.6; y1: 640.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The Cape Town regional rainfall is also potentially linked to other hemispheric phenomena, such as the expansion of the tropics and, specifically, the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the position of the subtropical jet, which share some variability with the SAM. The relationships between these phenomena and Cape Town rainfall have not been thoroughly investigated outside of the context of the 2015&#8211;2017 drought, but the drought itself was associated with poleward expansion of the subtropical anticyclones in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans and (a resulting) poleward displacement of the moisture corridor across the South Atlantic (Sousa et&#160;al., 2018a), as well as a&#160;weaker subtropical jet (Mahlalela et&#160;al., 2019). Burls et&#160;al. (2019) also link the decline in the number of rainy days to the increase in sea level pressure along the poleward flank of the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the intensity of the post-frontal ridging high. Additionally, there is a&#160;possible linkage between Cape Town rainfall and near-shore cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies arising from Ekman upwelling due to reduced westerly and increased south-easterly winds. These might lead to suppression of convection and reduction of rainfall over land (Rouault et&#160;al., 2010). All these phenomena are conceptually consistent with the poleward migration of the westerlies and expansion of the tropics.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.22" top="354.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="354.6" x1="563.22" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Rainfall in the Cape Town region also responds to SST anomalies in the south-east Atlantic, including the Agulhas Current retroflection region, which may drive intensification of low-pressure systems, leading to the trailing front strengthening as it makes landfall over the Cape Town region (Reason and Jagadheesha, 2005). There are also linkages at the seasonal time scale between the Cape Town regional rainfall and Antarctic sea ice (Blamey and Reason, 2007).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="258.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="258.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In addition to mid-latitude controls, subtropical processes also play a&#160;role in the Cape Town region&#8217;s rainfall variability. The 10&#176;S&#8211;30&#176;S region of the subtropical Atlantic, parts of the South American continent and even parts of the African continent north of Cape Town are sources of moisture for atmospheric river events contributing to frontal rainfall (Blamey et&#160;al., 2018; Ramos et&#160;al., 2019), with implications for the 2015&#8211;2017 drought (Sousa et&#160;al., 2018a). Also, the second major rainfall contributing system, cut-off-lows, is conditional on moisture supply from the subtropics (Abba Omar and Abiodun, 2020).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="126.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Although El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences climate in southern Africa, any relationship between ENSO and Cape Town&#8217;s rainfall is weak and inconsistent, showing the strongest impact in May to June (Philippon et&#160;al., 2012). ENSO, however, does influence large-scale processes and phenomena relevant to the drought, though the relationship between ENSO and the SAM is complex, with each ENSO event influencing the SAM differently in different seasons </span></div></body></html>
