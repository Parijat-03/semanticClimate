Only observations documented in the scienti&#64257;c literature are shown, but impacts may also be experienced elsewhere. For physical changes yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the measured variable. For impacts on ecosystems and human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (bene&#64257;cial) or negative (adverse). Cells assigned &#8216;increase and decrease&#8217; indicate that within that region both increase and decrease of physical changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing &#8216;positive and negative&#8217; impacts. Con&#64257;dence levels refer to con&#64257;dence in attribution to cryospheric changes. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional scale, or the evidence is insuf&#64257;cient for assessment. Tundra refers to tundra and alpine meadows. Migration refers to an increase and decrease in net migration, not bene&#64257;cial/adverse value. Impacts on tourism refer to the operating conditions for the tourism sector. Cultural services include cultural identity, sense of home, intrinsic and aesthetic values, as well as contributions from glacier archaeology.

Those impacts were assessed in a dedicated manner only in earlier IPCC assessments (Beniston and Fox, 1996; Gitay et al., 2001; Fischlin et al., 2007) but not in AR5 (Settele et al., 2014). Two of the most evident changes include range shifts of plants and animals in Central Europe and the Himalaya but also for other mountain regions (e.g.,&#160;Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Evangelista et al., 2016; Freeman et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2018; You et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), and increases in species richness on mountain summits (Khamis et al., 2016; Fell et al., 2017; Steinbauer et al., 2018) of which some have accelerated during recent decades (e.g., Steinbauer et al., 2018), though slowing over the past ten years in Austria (e.g., Lamprecht et al., 2018). While many changes in freshwater communities have been directly attributed to changes in the cryosphere (Jacobsen et al., 2012; Milner et al., 2017), separating the direct in&#64258;uence of atmospheric warming from the in&#64258;uence of concomitant cryospheric change and independent biotic processes has been often challenging for terrestrial ecosystems (Grytnes et al., 2014; Lesica and Crone, 2016; Frei et al., 2018; Lamprecht et al., 2018). Changing climate in high mountains places further stress on biota, which are already impacted by land use and its change, direct exploitation, and pollutants (D&#237;az et al., 2019; Wester et al., 2019). Species are required to shift their behaviours, including seasonal aspects, and distributional ranges to track suitable climate conditions (Settele et al., 2014). In the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#186;C (SR15), climate change scenarios exceeding mean global warming of 1.5&#186; C relative to preindustrial levels have been estimated to lead to major impacts on species </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.5" top="411.57"><span x0="323.44" y0="411.57" x1="571.5" style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.84; y0: 411.57; y1: 421.07; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">abundances, community structure, and ecosystem functioning in high mountain areas (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The size and isolation of mountain habitats (Steinbauer et al., 2016; Cotto et al., 2017), which may vary strongly with the topography of mountain ridges (Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Graae et al., 2018), affects critically the survival of species as they migrate across mountain ranges, increasing in general the risks for many species from climate change (Settele et al., 2014; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016).</span></div><div left="323.43" right="352.23" top="303.42"><span x0="323.43" y0="303.42" x1="352.23" style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.23; y0: 303.42; y1: 313.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2.3.3.1 </span><span style="x0: 363.12; x1: 367.56; y0: 303.42; y1: 313.42; width: 4.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="363.12" y0="303.42" x1="422.53">Terrestrial Biota</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.48" top="279.52"><span x0="323.43" y0="279.52" x1="571.48" style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 279.52; y1: 289.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The cryosphere can play a critical role in moderating and driving how species respond to climate change in high mountains (</span><span style="x0: 553.35; x1: 557.93; y0: 267.53; y1: 277.03; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="553.35" y0="267.53" x1="571.47">high con&#64257;dence</span><span x0="362.32" y0="255.53" x1="571.46" style="x0: 362.32; x1: 364.96; y0: 255.53; y1: 265.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).
