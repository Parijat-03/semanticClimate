<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0125">Apart from designing and simulating modelling scenarios heavily orienting on different magnitudes of lifestyle changes across a diverse set of dimensions and socioeconomic groups, the transitions research agenda must first take note of the criticisms and shortcomings of the current generation of models, in both the supply <xref rid="b0740" ref-type="bibr">[148]</xref> and the demand side <xref rid="b0745" ref-type="bibr">[149]</xref>. For instance, modelling work should distinguish voluntary behavioural changes from changes due to policy implementation&#8212;e.g. how people adapted to the COVID-19 reality and what part of this new norm was enforced by the policy response. This distinction should be made before delving into behavioural change to the level of understanding the drivers of such changes and how these may develop, or how interventions can help push macro-level developments towards desired trajectories <xref rid="b0750" ref-type="bibr">[150]</xref>. Any modelling exercise aimed at building this understanding must therefore begin by defining model parameters, assumptions and scenario drivers in terms of efficiency, technological substitution and lifestyle change <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and in terms of efficiency, consistency and sufficiency <xref rid="b0755" ref-type="bibr">[151]</xref> and other distinctions or frameworks <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Models can help identify the role of diverse lifestyle profiles among different social groups, thereby serving to assess the impact of top-down mitigation policy on different groups in society and allowing to explore the impact of potential growth of specific lifestyle profiles on achieving emissions cuts.</p>
