A review of many different types of state-level climate policies revealed that there are many more policies to advance renewables than there are to end fossil fuel reliance (Burke and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). Climate justice activists have thus engaged in multi-year protests targeting fossil fuel infrastructure, advocating for supply-side climate policies such as fracking bans, fossil fuel moratoria, state pension divestment campaigns, and litigation for climate harms (Piggot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2018</xref>; Healy &amp; Barry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017</xref>). Controversy about whether or not institutions and investment portfolios should &#8220;divest&#8221; from fossil fuels demonstrates this division in pro-climate policy coalitions (Trinks et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2018</xref>); many colleges and universities have resisted the urge to divest and have pledged instead to &#8220;invest&#8221; in renewables (Mikkelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2021</xref>, Stephens et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2018</xref>).</p>
