<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Looking at <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_tab_003" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>, we see that a few personal pronouns ranked especially high in our keywords analysis results, notably <italic toggle="yes">our</italic> in Corpus 1, and <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> in Corpus 2. Here, we take these two terms as starting points for a discussion around the role of an ecosophy in corpus linguistic analysis. For the purposes of this article, which we dedicate to the demonstration of an ecosophy in practice for the development of communications recommendations, we do not go into extensive depth on each result but rather seek to relate these results to our ecosophy.</p>
