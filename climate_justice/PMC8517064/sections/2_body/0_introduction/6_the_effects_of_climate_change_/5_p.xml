In an analysis of the adequacy of current adaptation efforts amongst small scale farmers in developing countries, Thornton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>) surveyed 6300 households across 21 countries and 45 sites. Their results indicate that across a wide range of locations and conditions, most agricultural households&#8217; adaptation actions are not sufficient to allow for an improvement in their livelihoods or their ability to increase production to meet growing food demands. Successful cases of adequate adaptation were found to be dependent on high levels of collective action, organizational development and community awareness, e.g. the enabling environment (Thornton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>).</p>
