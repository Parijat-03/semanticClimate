More specifically, we call for further research that investigates how relational ontologies, epistemologies, and ethics intra-act to compose a relational approach to sustainability. In this context, intra-action means &#8220;<italic>the mutual constitution of entangled agencies</italic>. That is, in contrast to the usual &#8216;interaction,&#8217; which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction, the notion of intra-action recognizes that distinct agencies do not precede, but rather emerge through, their intra-action&#8221; (Barad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>, p. 33). On this basis, we conclude with a call to action for sustainability scholars and practitioners to co-develop a research agenda for advancing a relational paradigm within sustainability research, practice, and education based on relational ways of being, knowing, and acting.</p>
