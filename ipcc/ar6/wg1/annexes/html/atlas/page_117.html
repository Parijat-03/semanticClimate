The snow cover can also play a 2 role for upper trophic levels such as ring seals, which use snow caves for raising their pups (Kovacs et al., 3 2012; Iacozza and Ferguson, 2014; Hamilton et al., 2018).  4 5 Mechanical properties of the sea-ice and snow system are relevant for ice dynamics, such as ridging and 6 rafting of sea ice, but also for human activity (shipping). With the latter, snow on sea ice has a direct societal 7 relevance. A snow cover on sea ice increases the mechanical friction for a ship navigating through the ice. 8 9 10 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 646.25; y1: 657.23; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="646.25" x1="218.62">[START Figure Atlas.50: HERE]  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="646.25" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 646.25; y1: 657.23; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">11 12 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 622.16; y1: 632.18; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="622.16" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.50: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="622.16" x1="391.25" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 134.3; y0: 622.16; y1: 632.18; width: 6.68; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Conceptual flow diagram of relevant snow-on-sea-ice processes.  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="621.95" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 621.95; y1: 632.93; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">13 14 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 596.81; y1: 607.79; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="596.81" x1="205.17">[END Figure Atlas.50: HERE]  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="596.81" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 596.81; y1: 607.79; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">15 16 17 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.62; y0: 558.83; y1: 569.81; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="558.83" x1="250.49">Atlas.6 Climate change communication </span><span x0="27.66" y0="558.83" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 558.83; y1: 569.81; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18 19 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 532.55; y1: 543.53; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="532.55" x1="376.49">Atlas.6.1 Approaches to communicating climate change information </span><span x0="27.66" y0="532.55" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 532.55; y1: 543.53; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">20 21 The primary purpose of IPCC assessment reports is to provide policymakers and practitioners at all levels 22 with the scientific information they need to develop climate policies. The information needs to be provided 23 in a manner which is accessible, relevant and usable for the intended audience. This requires that the science 24 be communicated in a way that allows non-scientific audiences to recognise easily and without ambiguity the 25 implications of that science for their decision-making. The term &#8216;policymaker&#8217; in itself covers a wide range 26 of users with varying societal and cultural perspectives, expertise and specialist scientific knowledge. Aside 27 from feeding into international, national and local climate policy, region-specific information on climate 28 impacts and projected changes under different scenarios contained within the IPCC reports serves a practical 29 purpose and provides input into designing better forecasting systems, spatial planning and early warning 30 systems. The detailed technical findings in IPCC reports also serve as an important benchmark resource for 31 the research community. Finally, growing societal engagement with climate change means IPCC reports are 32 increasingly used directly by businesses, the financial sector, health practitioners, civil society, the media and 33 educators at all levels. While the primary audience remains decision makers, the IPCC reports could 34 effectively be considered a tiered set of products with information relevant to a range of audiences. 35 36 Information on observed or projected climate change can be aggregated to different levels across a range of 37 spatial and temporal scales, from global mean long-term climate characteristics to regionalized and tailored 38 records of observed or projected impacts on a specific group of people. The aggregation scale not only 39 affects the (un)certainty level or confidence in the presented findings, but also the perception of the 40 information by recipients. Assessing impacts of climate change does require integration of climate and non-41 climatic information, which makes communication between inter- and transdisciplinary teams necessary. 42 Although &#8216;neutral&#8217; communication about climate change is difficult to achieve or define, communication 43 actions aimed at informing the general public about the assessed scientific findings regarding climate change 44 have a different purpose and format from actions that are intended to inform a specific target audience in 45 order to support adaptation or mitigation policies (Whetton et al., 2016). 46 47 Scientists tend to focus on what they do not know before emphasizing points of agreement (National 48 Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2017). This focus on uncertainty obscures the level of scientific 49 consensus on main climate change features (Lewandowsky et al., 2015). In addition, it can lead to &#8216;action 50 paralysis&#8217;, when a weighting or comparison of available adaptation or mitigation actions is complicated by 51 the large number of unresolved drivers for determining an optimal mix of measures. 52 53 Rather than stressing the inherent uncertainty in the understanding of past phenomena or future pathways, an 54 emphasis on a &#8216;likely&#8217; or &#8216;plausible&#8217; range of conditions is being advocated to be an effective approach in 55 </span></div></body></html>
