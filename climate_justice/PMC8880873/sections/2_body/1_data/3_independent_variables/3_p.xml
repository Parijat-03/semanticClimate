<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most tribes do not have experience with renewable technologies and need external support to build on them. Hence, we control whether the tribe has received a <italic toggle="yes">Department of Energy&#8217;s grant</italic> for developing wind power. The U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Office of Indian Energy Policy and programs has been funding energy-related projects on tribal lands since 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A predecessor program, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy&#8217;s (EERE) Tribal Energy Program was providing funding prior to 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These projects have helped tribal governments build the institutional capacity to manage their energy needs and to assess the feasibility of renewable energy technologies. Some tribes in our sample have renewable energy projects and programs that are funded by this grant right now or that were jumpstarted by this grant in earlier years. We include a binary variable with 1 denoting a tribe that has secured at least one DOE grant and 0 denoting a tribe that did not receive any DOE grants.</p>
