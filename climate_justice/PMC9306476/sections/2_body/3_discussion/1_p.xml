We found that different institutions are in different stages of developing and implementing a sustainability agenda, and this is a rapidly evolving area. For the purposes of this work, we focused on sustainability in terms of greenhouse gas emissions as the main driver of climate change. Here, we offer our thoughts as to how institutions in global health research and higher education can strengthen their sustainability strategies and implementation plans with a specific focus on reducing emissions. These principles can apply to any field, not just global health.</p>
