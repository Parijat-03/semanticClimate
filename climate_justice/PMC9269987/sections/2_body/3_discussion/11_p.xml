<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Given the predictive power of guilt, and authentic pride, we agree with <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Landmann (2020)</xref> that addressing (already existing) generalized emotions may be more effective than single (induced) emotional episodes. We assume the proneness or dispositional tendency to experience a specific type of emotion to play a key role in motivating pro-environmental behavior. Being used in such a way, emotion research can help to better understand the psychological processes in pro-environmental intention and behavior. <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Roeser (2012)</xref> confirms that emotions may help to see something that purely rational assessments fail to discover. In her study, information about climate change with emotional content provided better insight into its moral meaning, while also providing a deeper, more reliable source of motivation for action than information without emotional content. Consequently, especially in the domain of the psychology of justice and morality, emotions are central and should receive more attention from environmental psychologists.</p>
