Climate change, which is largely a result of burning fossil fuels, is already affecting the Earth&#8217;s temperature, precipitation, and hydrological cycles. Continued changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation, heat waves, and other extreme events are likely, all which will impact agricultural production. Furthermore, compounded climate factors can decrease plant productivity, resulting in price increases for many important agricultural crops. Wheat, paddy and mustard are the major growing crops in Delhi, if the temperature of atmosphere goes up / high due to climate change, in that case the yield of cereal crops decreases slightly, the price will rise for the most important agricultural crops, the infestation of insect/pest incidences increased, soil fertility affected, crop growth affected, crop development affected to cope-up with such situations the following measures may be adopted to mitigate climate change in agriculture.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="298.33" top="452.16"><span x0="72.02" y0="452.16" x1="298.33" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 83.35; y0: 452.16; y1: 464.16; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Mitigation of Climate Change in Agriculture</span><span x0="298.37" y0="452.16" x1="526.35" style="x0: 298.37; x1: 301.71; y0: 452.16; y1: 464.16; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: Sustainable practices such as organic farming, natural farming can help farmers adapt to the changing climate. Integrated farming systems based on locally available resources by including trees, livestock, and water management can help mitigate climate change to a large extent and improve the quality of life of the farmers. Although Delhi continues to emit greater and greater amounts of GHGs due to accelerated industrialization process, almost 20 per cent of its GHG emissions actually come from agriculture. Methane (CH4) emissions from irrigated rice production, nitrous oxide (N2O) from the use of nitrogenous fertilizers, and the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy sources used to pump groundwater for irrigation are the primary culprits. Generally, mitigation includes reducing emissions of carbon dioxides, methane and nitrous oxides, sequestering carbon, clean development mechanism, etc. Emissions of carbon dioxide from changes in agricultural land use can be reduced by slowing deforestation. The other appropriate approaches of mitigation include changes in agricultural land management viz. conservation tillage, agroforestry, and rehabilitation of degraded crop and pasture land, overall improvement of nutrition and genetics of ruminant livestock, storage and capture technologies for manure, and conversions of emissions into biogas. Most of these approaches have positive outcomes in terms of higher productivity, better management of natural resources, or the production of valuable by-products, such as bioenergy.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.09" top="156.55"><span x0="72.02" y0="156.55" x1="526.09" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 156.55; y1: 168.55; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The distribution of wild crop relatives, an increasingly important genetic resource for the breeding of crops, will be severely affected due to climate change, we as individuals do to help slow the loss of biodiversity, since consumption of resources is a root cause of biodiversity loss, we can consume less and be more mindful about what we consume. We need to leverage our purchasing power to help protect biodiversity by consuming products that do not harm the environment. </span></div></body></html>
