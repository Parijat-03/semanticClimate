The IPC facilitated the participation of the global food sovereignty movement to numerous FAO policy fora, building the capacities of small-scale food producers to use regional-global spaces effectively to advocate for food sovereignty. The IPC was thus well positioned to participate actively in the negotiations of the reform of the CFS, and in developing proposals for the creation of the <italic>Civil Society Mechanism for relations with the CFS</italic>, which finally came into being in 2010.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> The CSM is a self-organized, autonomous and essential component of the reformed CFS with the purpose of enabling the participation of civil society actors involved in food and nutrition issues. CSM participants come from 11 constituencies and 17 sub-regions to ensure wide participation and a balance of sectors, regions and genders. In October 2018, the CSM renamed itself as the <italic>Civil Society and Indigenous People&#8217;s Mechanism</italic> as a sign of respect for the international recognition of the identities and rights of indigenous peoples and their unique systems of governance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref></p>
