Parties to the UNFCCC are expected to submit updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards 2030 and mid-century greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions development strategies, followed by the 2023 Global Stocktake of collective progress and gaps. In some cases, this is not as straightforward a process as the original submission of NDCs in 2015&#8211;2016, involving significantly larger amounts of effort. For example, the European Union (EU), being both among top emitters and one supranational body with a collective action pledge, faces the additional challenge of achieving and monitoring progress at both Community and Member State level <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.
