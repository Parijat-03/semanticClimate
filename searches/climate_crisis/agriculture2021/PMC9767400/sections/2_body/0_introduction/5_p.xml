<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0020">It has been widely acknowledged that food systems have failed in their objective &#8211; delivering food security (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">GP, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Haddad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">de Schutter, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">G&#243;mez et al., 2013</xref>). Their failure has been particularly pronounced during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, estimated to have led to a rise in acute food insecurity in 2020&#8211;2021. While global food systems have been resilient enough to ensure food has remained available during the pandemic, millions more have been affected by food insecurity, being unable to access sufficient and nutritious food (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bank, 2021</xref>). &#8216;The consensus is that something needs to be done&#8217; (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">B&#233;n&#233; et al., 2019</xref>). Although important, this consensus and the focus of the debates on enhancing the resilience and sustainability of food systems has barely integrated a gender lens. The primary areas of research and policy interest have been on issues of productivity, the environmental implications of food systems, and consumption behaviors (<xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Challinor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Foley et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
