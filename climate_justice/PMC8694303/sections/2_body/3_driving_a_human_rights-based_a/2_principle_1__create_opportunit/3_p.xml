Similar to gender quotas in parliaments, quotas for young people in national ministries and international organizations would provide young people with the opportunity to hold leadership positions.<sup><xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Although young people represent one-fifth of the global population, they make up only 2% of world parliamentarians.<sup><xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Only nine countries, including Uganda and Rwanda, have mandatory parliamentary youth quotas.<sup><xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> At the international institutional level, in support of the Global Consensus Statement on Meaningful Adolescent and Youth Engagement, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH) has introduced a requirement for all constituencies and governing committees to assign a vice chair role to a young person (under the age of 30).<sup><xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> This has increased the number of young people in leadership positions, allowing them to help shape the work of PMNCH and empowering them to advocate for women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s, and adolescents&#8217; health.</p>
