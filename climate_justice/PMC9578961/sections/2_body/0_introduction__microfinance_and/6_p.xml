<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">This paper proposes an examination of microfinance and resilience policy in light of sustainable development (SD). The main research goal is to establish the core connections and relevance within principal development policy draftings &#8211; i.e. the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/69/315 (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015</xref>). To this end, summative content analysis is performed on 6 selected SGDs on this subject with the scope to disentangle existing relationships among concepts within the Agenda 2030. The goal is to determine the existence and frequency of key development policy concepts related to microfinance and resilience. The findings may be used by scholars, policymakers, entrepreneurs, administrators, practitioners and those interested in financial access and sustainable development to be used for conceptual and fungible needs.</p>
