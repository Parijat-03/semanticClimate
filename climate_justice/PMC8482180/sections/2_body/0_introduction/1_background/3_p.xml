For many Indigenous communities, the issue of food sovereignty is as critical to their survival as having adequate food supply [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Food sovereignty refers to the &#8220;right of local peoples to control their own food systems, including markets, ecological resources, food cultures, and production modes&#8221; [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This includes the right to define their own food systems, the ability to make decisions about consumption, harvesting practices, and relationship with the land [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Food sovereignty is a necessary component of cultural food security&#8212;a distinct but overlapping concept [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Households or communities can have food security without food sovereignty; however, there is no sovereignty without food security [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
