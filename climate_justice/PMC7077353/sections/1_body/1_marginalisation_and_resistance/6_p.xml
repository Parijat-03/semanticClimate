Bengali couples are distributed more evenly across the three income bands. There is a strong differential in the number of men farming their own land. Low land ownership and low levels of education among Santal contributes to high levels of Santal men seeking work as day labourers. Discrepancies between the genders also emerge. Among Santal, few women and men have had any formal education. However, although Bengali Muslims are more educated, the gender gap between women and men on this indicator is more marked. The most startling difference between Santal and Bengali women is in occupation, with nine out of 10 Santal women in daily wage labour and nine out of 10 Bengali women remaining at home.</p>
