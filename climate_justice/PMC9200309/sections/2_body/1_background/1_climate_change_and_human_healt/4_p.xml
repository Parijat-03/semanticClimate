Yet as stated in the Lancet Commission on the Legal Determinants of Health, &#8220;While law can be a powerful tool for advancing global health, it remains substantially underutilised and poorly understood. Working in partnership, public health lawyers and health professionals can become champions for evidence-based laws to ensure the public&#8217;s health and safety&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Law is a powerful tool to advance global health because climate change adversely affects the physical health and mental health of people in all countries [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many indigenous peoples and local communities [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Yet, according to the World Economic Forum &#8220;groups of stakeholders (the private sector, corporate and financial organizations) have taken part in a system that funds the destruction of nature&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is enabled by a rule of law, which more often gives primacy to corporate rights over the health of nature. Using scientific evidence, namely climate science and public health, law can advance health, human rights, and the rights of nature.</p>
