This has occurred despite emerging knowledge about the role that rivers and riverine ecosystems play in human development and in generating global, regional and local ES (Nilsson and Berggren 2000; Hoeinghaus et al. 2009). The transformation of river ecosystems for irrigation, hydropower and water requirements of societies worldwide is the biggest threat to freshwater and estuarine biodiversity and ecosystems services (Nilsson and Berggren 2000; V&#246;r&#246;smarty et al. 2010). These projects address important energy and water-related demands, but their economic bene&#64257;ts are often overestimated in relation to trade-offs with respect to food (river capture &#64257;sheries), biodiversity and downstream ES (Winemiller et al. 2016). Some trade-offs and synergies related to SDG7 impact on aspirations of greater welfare and well-being, as well as physical and social infrastructure for sustainable development (Fuso Nerini et al. 2018) (Section&#160;7.5.6.1, where trade-offs exist between climate mitigation and food).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="483.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 483.55; y1: 493.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="483.55" x1="313.26">There are also spatial trade-offs related to large river diversion projects and export of &#8216;virtual water&#8217; through water-intensive crops produced in one region and exported to another, with implications for food security, water security and downstream ES of the exporting region (Hanasaki et al. 2010; Verma et al. 2009). Synergies include cropping adaptations that increase food system production and eliminate hunger (SDG2) (Rockstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Lipper et al. 2014a; Neufeldt et al. 2013). Well-adapted agricultural systems are shown to have synergies, positive returns on investment and contribute to safe drinking water, health, biodiversity and equity goals (DeClerck 2016). Assessing the water footprint of different sectors at the river basin scale can provide insights for interventions and decision-making (Zeng et al. 2012).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="315.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="315.57" x1="313.26">Sometimes the trade-offs in SDGs can arise in the articulation and nested hierarchy of 17&#160;goals and the targets under them.

There is no equivalent goal exclusively for freshwater ecosystems, but hidden under SDG 6&#160; (Clean water and sanitation) out of six listed targets, the sixth target is about protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, which suggests a&#160;lower order of global priority compared to being listed as a&#160;goal in itself (e.g., SDG 14).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="99.05" top="195.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 195.59; y1: 205.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="195.59" x1="99.05">There is </span><span style="x0: 103.04; x1: 105.14; y0: 195.59; y1: 205.09; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="103.04" y0="195.59" x1="168.02">limited evidence </span><span style="x0: 172.0; x1: 176.4; y0: 195.59; y1: 205.09; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="172.0" y0="195.59" x1="187.82">and </span><span style="x0: 191.81; x1: 193.91; y0: 195.59; y1: 205.09; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="191.81" y0="195.59" x1="263.82">limited agreement </span><span style="x0: 267.8; x1: 270.61; y0: 195.59; y1: 205.09; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="267.8" y0="195.59" x1="313.27">that binary evaluations of individual SDGs and synergies and trade-offs that categorise interactions as either &#8216;bene&#64257;cial&#8217; or &#8216;adverse&#8217; may be subjective and challenged further by the fact that feedbacks can often not be assigned as unambiguously positive or negative (Blanc et al. 2017). The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of&#160;1.5&#176;C (SR15) notes: &#8216;A reductive focus on speci&#64257;c SDGs in isolation may undermine the long-term achievement of sustainable climate change mitigation&#8217; (Holden et al. 2017).

However, even this approach ignores systemic properties and interactions across the system as a&#160;whole (Weitz et al. 2017a). Pursuit of certain targets in one area can generate rippling effects across the system, and these in turn can have secondary impacts on yet other targets. Weitz et al. (2017a) found that SDG target 13.2 (climate change policy/planning) is in&#64258;uenced by actions in six other targets. SDG 13.1 (climate change adaption) and also SDG&#160;2.4 (food production) receive the most positive in&#64258;uence from progression in other targets.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="353.98" top="567.63"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="567.63" x1="353.98">There is </span><span style="x0: 354.37; x1: 361.23; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="354.37" y0="567.63" x1="420.16">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 420.55; x1: 424.94; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="420.55" y0="567.63" x1="436.37">and </span><span style="x0: 436.76; x1: 441.34; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="436.76" y0="567.63" x1="496.22">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 496.61; x1: 499.42; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="496.61" y0="567.63" x1="571.77">that, to be effective, truly sustainable, and to reduce or mitigate emerging risks, SDGs need knowledge dissemination and policy initiatives that recognise and assimilate concepts of co-production of ES in socio-ecological systems, cross-scale linkages, uncertainty, spatial and temporal trade-offs between SDGs and ES that acknowledge biophysical, social and political constraints and understand how social change occurs at various scales (Rodr&#237;guez et al. 2006; Norstr&#246;m et al. 2014; Palomo et al. 2016). Several methods and tools are proposed in literature to address and understand SDG interactions. Nilsson et&#160;al.
