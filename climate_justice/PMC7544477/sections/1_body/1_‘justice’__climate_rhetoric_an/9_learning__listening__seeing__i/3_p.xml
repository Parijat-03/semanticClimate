<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0115">Over more than a dozen cases (trials and sentencing hearings) from mid 2018 to mid 2020, all concerning this one injunction, I met many &#8220;sinister seniors&#8221; &#8211; women and men in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, some of whom regularly came to court sessions to offer solidarity to people on trial. Some had trials and sentencing hearings earlier in 2018; their &#8220;sinister&#8221; label came initially from the judge telling them that standing on a road was a &#8220;sinister act of contempt&#8221; (the &#8220;<italic>sinister senior</italic>&#8221; label thereafter became self-inflicted - worn as a badge of honour). Many grandmothers spoke about solidarity with Indigenous rights at trials, and about oil and the future for younger generations. Coming to the court was an endeavour to learn, to show solidarity, to see the performance of power in grotesque forms as well as &#8220;subtle dramas&#8221; (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Flower, 2018</xref>) with significant and sometimes not-so-subtle meanings, and to talk about what values matters &#8211; and what dilemmas exist in framing a &#8220;necessity to act&#8221; defence. Not all defendants chose to advance such defences, which required substantial paperwork. Being in the court provided ways of seeing unique choices that each defendant engaged, and that different prosecutors employed, where word choices, tone and affect all mattered.</p>
