Barrios et al. (2006) found that urbanisation in Sub-Saharan Africa was partially in&#64258;uenced by climatic factors during the 1950&#8211;2000 period, in parallel to liberalisation of internal restrictions on labour movements: each&#160;1% reduction in rainfall was associated with a&#160;0.45% increase in urbanisation. This migration favoured more industrially diverse urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa (Henderson et al. 2017), because they offer more diverse employment opportunities and higher wages. Similar trends were also observed in Iran in response to water scarcity (Madani et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="65.21" right="313.25" top="231.58"><span style="x0: 65.21; x1: 70.66; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.21" y0="231.58" x1="313.25">However, migration involves some initial investments.

Globally, it was shown that every USD invested into restoring degraded lands yields social returns, including both provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services, in the range of&#160;3&#8211;6 USD over a&#160;30-year period (Nkonya et al. 2016a). A&#160;similar range of returns from land restoration activities was found in Central Asia (Mirzabaev et al. 2016), Ethiopia (Gebreselassie et al. 2016), India (Mythili and Goedecke 2016), Kenya (Mulinge et al. 2016), Niger (Moussa et al. 2016) and Senegal (Sow et al. 2016) (</span><span style="x0: 326.36; x1: 333.22; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="326.36" y0="591.54" x1="398.74">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 398.74; x1: 401.38; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="398.74" y0="591.54" x1="571.79">).

Part of the reason for these low adoption rates is that the major share of the returns from SLM are social bene&#64257;ts, namely in the form of non-provisioning ecosystem services (Nkonya et al. 2016a). The adoption of SLM technologies does not always provide implementers with immediate private bene&#64257;ts (Schmidt et al. 2017). High initial investment costs, institutional and governance constraints and a&#160;lack of access to technologies and equipment may inhibit their adoption further (Giger et al. 2015; Sanz et al. 2017; Schmidt et al. 2017). However, not all SLM practices have high upfront costs. Analysing the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) database, a&#160;globally acknowledged reference database for SLM, Giger et al. (2015) found that the upfront costs of SLM technologies ranged from about 20 USD to 5000 USD, with the median cost being around 500 USD. Many SLM technologies are pro&#64257;table within 3&#160;to 10 years (</span><span style="x0: 436.35; x1: 443.21; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="436.35" y0="387.56" x1="506.53">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 506.53; x1: 509.17; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="506.53" y0="387.56" x1="571.76">) (Djanibekov and Khamzina 2016; Giger et al. 2015; Moussa et al. 2016; Sow et al. 2016). About 73% of 363 SLM technologies evaluated were reported to become pro&#64257;table within three years, while 97% were pro&#64257;table within 10 years (Giger et al. 2015). Similarly, it was shown that social returns from investments in restoring degraded lands will exceed their costs within six years in many settings across drylands (Nkonya et al. 2016a). However, even with affordable upfront costs, market failures&#160;&#8211; in the form of lack of access to credit, input and output markets, and insecure land tenure (Section&#160;3.1.3)&#160;&#8211; result in the lack of adoption of SLM technologies (Moussa et al. 2016). Payments for ecosystem services, subsidies for SLM, and encouragement of community collective action can lead to a&#160;higher level of adoption of SLM and land restoration activities (</span><span style="x0: 451.54; x1: 458.4; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="451.54" y0="231.58" x1="521.5">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 521.51; x1: 524.15; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="521.51" y0="231.58" x1="571.74">) (Bouma and W&#246;sten 2016; Lambin et al. 2014; Reed et al. 2015; Schiappacasse et al. 2012; van Zanten et al. 2014) (Section&#160;3.6.3).

These factors are shaped by national government policies and international markets.
