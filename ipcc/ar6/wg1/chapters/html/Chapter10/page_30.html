They are typically based on coupled global model simulations, such as those in the Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) and ScenarioMIP part of CMIP6 covering the period 1850&#8211;2100 (Eyring et&#160;al., 2016a), and HighResMIP (1950&#8211;2050; Haarsma et&#160;al., 2016). Global transient climate simulations may be further downscaled by either dynamical or statistical downscaling. Currently available CORDEX RCM simulations (1950&#8211;2100) are based on CMIP5 (Gutowski Jr.&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2016).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="438.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="438.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In contrast, time-slice experiments are designed to represent only a&#160;specific period of time (typically 30 years). They are often run using global and regional models in atmosphere-only mode, forced by SSTs derived either from observations, as AMIP experiments, or from historical simulations and future projections of coupled global models. Compared to transient simulations, they offer advantages in being computationally cheaper (due to the lack of coupled ocean and short duration), which allows for the number of ensemble members (T. Zhang et&#160;al., 2016), and/or the resolution (Haarsma et&#160;al., 2013b; Davini et&#160;al., 2017) to be increased. Convection-permitting simulations, both covering the globe or particular regions, are currently conducted for short time slices only (Kendon et&#160;al., 2017; Hewitt and Lowe, 2018; Coppola et&#160;al., 2020; Pichelli et&#160;al., 2021). Another high-resolution time-slice data base is d4PDF (Mizuta et&#160;al., 2017; Ishii and Mori, 2020). Experiments covering a&#160;limited integration period have been carried out for coupled ocean&#8211;atmosphere RCMs (Sein et&#160;al., 2015; Zou and Zhou, 2016b, 2017). However, long spin-up periods are required to reach a&#160;stable stationary state in the deep ocean that otherwise might lead to invalid projections (Planton et&#160;al., 2012; Soto-Navarro et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="229.26" top="186.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="186.48" x1="229.26" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 186.48; y1: 196.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.2.2 Pseudo-global Warming Experiments</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="162.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="162.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.67; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Results from downscaling experiments often suffer from large-scale circulation biases in the driving global models such as misplaced storm tracks (Section&#160;10.3.3.4), while changes in atmospheric circulation are often uncertain owing to both climate response uncertainty (Section&#160;10.3.4.2) and internal variability (Section&#160;10.3.4.3). In&#160;a&#160;given application, if one can assume that changes in the regional climate are dominated by thermodynamic rather than by circulation changes, so-called pseudo-global warming (PGW) experiments (Sch&#228;r et&#160;al., 1996) may be helpful in mitigating the effects of circulation biases, and to fix the large-scale circulation to present climate.

The boundary conditions thus represent the sequence of observed weather, but with adjusted temperatures, humidity and atmospheric stability. Recent applications of PGW experiments include assessments of climate change in Japan (Adachi et&#160;al., 2012; Kawase et&#160;al., 2012, 2013), the Los Angeles area (Walton&#160;et&#160;al., 2015), Hawaii (C. Zhang et&#160;al., 2016), and the Alps (Keller et&#160;al., 2018). Recently, PGW studies have been generalized to modify global model simulations with the objective of separating the drivers of regional climate change, such as the Mediterranean amplification (e.g.,&#160;Brogli et&#160;al., 2019b; Section&#160;10.3.2.3).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="570.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="570.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.66; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Equivalent simulations can be conducted for individual events, thereby allowing for very high resolution. With counterfactual past climate conditions, such simulations can be used for conditional event attribution (Trenberth et&#160;al., 2015; Chapter&#160;11), using hypothetical future conditions to generate physical climate storylines of how specific events may manifest in a&#160;warmer climate. The approach has been employed to study extreme events that require very high resolution simulations such as tropical cyclones (Lackmann, 2015; Takayabu et&#160;al., 2015; Lau et&#160;al., 2016; Kanada et&#160;al., 2017a; Gutmann et&#160;al., 2018; Patricola and Wehner, 2018; J. Chen et&#160;al., 2020) or convective precipitation events (Pall et&#160;al., 2017; Hibino et&#160;al., 2018). The range of possible events is broader and has included Korean heatwaves (Kim et&#160;al., 2018) and monsoon onset in West Africa (Lawal et&#160;al., 2016). However, if only individual events are simulated, no immediate conclusions can be derived for changes to the occurrence probability of these events (F.E.L. Otto et&#160;al., 2016; Shepherd, 2016a).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="499.58" top="366.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="366.48" x1="499.58" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 366.48; y1: 376.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.2.3 Sensitivity Studies With Selected Drivers</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="342.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="342.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Sensitivity studies are used to identify the impact of a&#160;specific forcing, driver or process on regional climate phenomena and changes and improve the process understanding. The influence of a&#160;single external forcing can be assessed with transient historical simulations within two different frameworks (Bindoff et&#160;al., 2013; Gillett et&#160;al., 2016). The first entails simulations taking prescribed (often observed) changes only in the external forcing of interest, the others being fixed at a&#160;constant value (often pre-industrial). The second framework is based on simulations in which all external forcings are applied other than the one of interest. Both approaches may not give the same results since the climate response to a&#160;range of forcings is not necessarily equal to the sum of climate responses to individual forcings (Ming and Ramaswamy, 2011; Jones et&#160;al., 2013; Schaller et&#160;al., 2013; Shiogama et&#160;al., 2013; Marvel et&#160;al., 2015; Deng&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2020).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="162.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="162.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">To study the influence of internal variability, new approaches such as partial coupling simulations are now routinely used since AR5. These are coupled ocean&#8211;atmosphere simulations in which the interaction between atmosphere and ocean is only one-way over a&#160;specified ocean basin or sub-basin and two-way everywhere else. Different implementations have been used such as SST anomaly Newtonian relaxation at the air&#8211;sea interface or prescription of wind-stress anomalies from reanalysis (Kosaka and Xie, 2013, 2016; England et&#160;al., 2014; McGregor et&#160;al., 2014; Douville et&#160;al., 2015; Deser&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2017a).
