However, there have been serendipitous outcomes from the associated lockdowns ranging from improved air quality to reductions in carbon emissions. Liu et&#160;al. (2022, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL096842" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL096842</ext-link>) revealed that even the magnitude of the heat islands in Chinese cities were reduced due to a decline in human activities and their associated anthropogenic contributions. These surprising findings have significant implications for understanding intersections among climate, health, energy, urban planning, transportation, and infrastructure.</p></abstract>
