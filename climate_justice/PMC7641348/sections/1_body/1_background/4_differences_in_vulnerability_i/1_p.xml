<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Vulnerability indices are often used to identify which populations are most susceptible to impacts from environmental hazards, but there are important differences and uncertainties across metrics [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous research demonstrated that data scaling, normalization, transformation, weighting, and aggregation techniques vary widely in index construction and that different design decisions and spatial resolutions impact measured outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A commonly applied index-construction technique is principal component analysis and factor weighting. Heat-specific vulnerability indices similarly differ in indicator weightings and selection [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The implications of different vulnerability index definitions and measurement methods as well as their consequences in guiding policy and funding are incompletely understood. Multiple studies agree on the importance of supplementing indices and high-level assessments of vulnerability and environmental justice with &#8220;ground-truthing,&#8221; which validates and embeds context into the process [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
