These empirical data on thermal responses of respiration demonstrate a globally convergent pattern (Huntingford et&#160;al. 2017). According to a sensitivity analysis of a relatively small number of ESMs, a newly derived function of instantaneous responses of plant respiration to temperature (instead of a traditional exponential function of Q10 =&#160;2) makes a signi&#64257;cant difference in estimated autotrophic respiration especially in cold biomes (Heskel et&#160;al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="567.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="567.54" x1="307.59">Acclimation results in reduced sensitivity of plant respiration with rising temperature, in essence, down regulation of warming-related increase in respiratory carbon emission (</span><span style="x0: 203.09; x1: 207.67; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="203.09" y0="543.55" x1="259.83">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 259.83; x1: 262.47; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="259.83" y0="543.55" x1="307.55">) (Atkin&#160;et&#160;al. 2015; Slot and Kitajima 2015; Tjoelker 2018).

Closing stomata enhances drought survival at the cost of reduced photosynthetic production, while not closing stomata avoids loss of photosynthetic production at the cost of increased drought mortality (Sperry and Love 2015). Hence, species-speci&#64257;c responses to drought, in terms of whether they close stomata or not, have short- and long-term consequences (Anderegg et&#160;al. 2018a; Buotte et&#160;al. 2019).

Yet, there is much uncertainty in the ability of current vegetation and land surface models to adequately capture tree mortality and the response of forests to climate extremes like drought (Rogers et&#160;al. 2017; Hartmann et&#160;al. 2018). Most vegetation models use climate stress envelopes or vegetation carbon balance estimations to project climate-driven mortality and loss of forests (McDowell et&#160;al. 2011); these may not adequately project biome shifts and impacts of disturbance in future climates. For example, a suite of vegetation models was compared to a &#64257;eld drought experiment in the Amazon on mature rainforest trees and all models performed poorly in projecting the timing and magnitude of biomass loss due to drought (Powell et&#160;al. 2013). More recently, the loss of water transport due to embolism (disruption of xylem water continuity) (Sperry and Love 2015), rather than carbon starvation (Rowland et&#160;al. 2015), is receiving attention as a key physiological process relevant for drought-induced tree mortality (Hartmann et&#160;al. 2018). A key challenge to modelling efforts is to consider differences among plant species and vegetation types in their drought responses. One approach is to classify plant species to &#8216;functional types&#8217; that exhibit similar responses to environmental variations (Anderegg et&#160;al. 2016). Certain traits of species, such as tree height, is shown to be predictive of growth decline and mortality in response to drought (Xu et&#160;al. 2016a). Similarly, tree rooting depth is positively related to mortality, contrary to expectation, during prolonged droughts in tropical dry forest (Chitra-Tarak et&#160;al. 2017). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="556.85" top="195.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 195.42; y1: 205.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="195.42" x1="556.85">2.7.3 Soil microbial effects on soil nutrient dynamics and plant responses to elevated CO</span><span style="x0: 506.76; x1: 510.4; y0: 182.04; y1: 189.04; width: 3.64; font-size: 7.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="506.76" y0="182.04" x1="510.4">2</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="159.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 159.52; y1: 169.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="159.52" x1="566.09">Soil microbial processes in&#64258;uencing nutrient and carbon dynamics represent a large source of uncertainty in projecting land&#8211;climate interactions.
