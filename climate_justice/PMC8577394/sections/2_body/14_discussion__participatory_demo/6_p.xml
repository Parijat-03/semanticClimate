It is difficult to tell from ethnographic data, and unlikely that the details of the New York case speak to the precise reality in other cities. Yet the stark presence of the mechanisms producing the legitimacy crisis in New York is telling. There is reason to expect the social controversies arising from the ESCR may be exacerbated and not softened in cities pursuing large scale-climate infrastructure: New York has pluralistic and participatory city politics, but even here, city officials ended up wielding authority by relying on technical expertise and ignoring the plan of public consensus. If and when governments of cities around the world begin pursuing similar projects to protect people living on the coast, it is possible that similar frictions could emerge between city and residents, as well as rifts between groups prioritizing existing environmental amenities and groups emphasizing long-term protection from climate impacts. Additional empirical research in other cities can shed light on these questions.</p>
