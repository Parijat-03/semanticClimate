It was first determined in Wuhan, China in December 2019. WHO named this virus as COVID-19. Virologist says that COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MARS virus. This deadly disease affected worldwide economically, hammering people lifestyle and also the environmental condition. After a few months, there is no vaccine to build the barricade between this virus and life. Many countries have tried to improve the methodology to control the disease and also the actual vaccine for coronavirus but not yet successful. Rapid testing, quarantine and social distancing slow down the social and economic movement. Although India, as one of the largest populated country, takes some respectable initiative after the pandemic of the novel coronavirus. According to WHO 24th May 2020 report, total 131,868 confirmed cases and killed over 3867 people by this COVID-19 pandemic. Indian government takes the initiative like janta curfew, lockdown all over the country. The main focus or aim of this study is to find the mortality rate and the recovered people at the fourth phase of lockdown, but the infected graph is daily increased in India. In the relation between active cases and the death cases, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is 0.8754. The relation between active cases and the recoveries, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is 0.9246.

The government take &#x0201c;Janta curfew&#x0201d;, fourth time of lockdown is not controlled by any more. Infracted number increased and gradually the recovered number was improved. Some states/UT is free from this pandemic like Nagaland and Lakshadweep. The economy of India is very much affected by this situation. Some industries are facing a huge amount of financial degradation or loss. The GDP is decreased gradually and it is at the lowest. It&#x02019;s depending on people common situation, Government cannot stop this pandemic for their policy or other related information till the peoples are not cautious about the pandemics and built social distance. In this situation, more life-threatening and if people will not follow the WHO guidelines, and it may play more havoc very soon.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Vidyasagar University to support this research.
