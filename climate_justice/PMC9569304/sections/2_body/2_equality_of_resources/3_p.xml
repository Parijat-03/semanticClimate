There shouldn&#8217;t be measures such as parental subsidies to compensate for the cost of procreation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref> Given that pregnancies require sexual intercourse, and given that in the case of minimally autonomous agents we can safely assume that they know that sexual intercourse may lead to the woman becoming pregnant, and assuming a wide availability of contraceptives, people can be held causally responsible for the pregnancy and the baby that will subsequently be born.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn17">17</xref> They may have deliberately desired and aimed for the pregnancy, or the pregnancy may have happened nondeliberatively, after which the procreators decided to continue the pregnancy. In either case, given the availability of contraceptives and abortion services, it is, if one reasons from within this framework, plausible to assume that pregnancies conceived under those circumstances should be regarded as resulting from the parents&#8217; so-called ambitions or preferences. As a result, there is, according to resource-egalitarian theories, nothing special about procreation that warrants us to treat procreative preferences as different from preferences to drive a fancy car or drink expensive wine.</p>
