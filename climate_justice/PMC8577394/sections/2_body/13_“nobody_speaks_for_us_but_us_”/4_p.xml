At one meeting, Nancy Ortiz, president of Vladeck Houses Resident Association, responded to the activists expressing this concern in an angered tone and defended her prioritization of flood protection:<disp-quote><p id="Par60">&#8220;The softball fields and tennis courts were closed on FDR drive for 5.5 years when they got renovated, nobody gave a hoot where our kids were playing, nobody cared that our kids did not have access to that area. We don&#8217;t care that there&#8217;s a 3.5 year, 4 year, closure. Why? Because that&#8217;s a drop in the bucket for a hundred years of protection to the 20,000 individuals who live in the New York City Housing Authority [public housing]. Nobody speaks for us, but us, thank you.&#8221;</p></disp-quote>In Nancy&#8217;s view as representative of public housing residents, it is desirable to trade a park closure of a few years in exchange for 100&#160;years of protection from climate changed storms and sea level rise. She went on to note that when small parts of the park closed in the past, affecting the recreation activities of mostly public housing residents, activists did not mobilize on their behalf, and so she asked that activists do not speak for her or for residents of public housing by the river.</p>
