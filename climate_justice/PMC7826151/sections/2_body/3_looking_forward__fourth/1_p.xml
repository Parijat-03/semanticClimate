In 2002, Pedretti noted the inclusion of criticality, the raising of social and environmental consciousness, and attention to socio-scientific issues&#8212;primarily through exhibitionary practices&#8212;as yet another major paradigm shift in the science museum world. The repurposing of science museums, their relevance, and mandates led us to identify a <italic>fourth generation</italic> (Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>). Informed by progressive views of scientific literacy, models of science communication that engage visitors in different ways, and the empirical work we conducted over the years, we argue that fourth<italic>-</italic>generation science museums are slowly emerging in different countries, in both private and public spheres, generating opportunities for re-imagining their spaces and practices while embracing broader goals and social roles.</p>
