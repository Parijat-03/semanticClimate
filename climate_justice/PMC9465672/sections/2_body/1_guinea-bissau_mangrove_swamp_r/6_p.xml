By contrast, cashews are a low labor-intensive and land-extensive crop that provides both cash income and food (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Additionally, the trees create land ownership in a time when the value of land has increased exponentially and conflicts over land tenure are blooming (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>). Before the expansion of cashew trees, villages' boundaries were known and respected by all, and each household possessed permanent holding rights to specific parcels of land. Consequently, land tenure conflicts both among rural people and between villages were relatively rare (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>).</p>
