<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0115">Some argue that expanding the scope of pro-poor justice to a planetary scale could produce a sense of powerlessness and encourage evasion of moral responsibility on the part of those most responsible for the global environmental crisis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dryzek and Pickering, 2018</xref>). This is indeed a possibility if a pro-poor focus within planetary justice is envisaged as a top-down intervention executed entirely at the global level. Instead, we advance a vision for building on the actions and interventions of various actors and agencies in state and society at multiple levels, from institutions of global governance to grassroots citizen initiatives. This multi-scale and multi-sector vision builds on plural actions and interventions that strengthen rather than weaken the sense of moral responsibility that we need in this current moment of planetary crisis.</p>
