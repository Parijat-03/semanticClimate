(2012)</xref> measure the four perspectives of justice sensitivity (victim, perpetrator, beneficiary, and observer). Each perspective is measured by two items, answered on a 6-point scale (ranging from &#8220;does not apply at all&#8221; to &#8220;fully applies&#8221;). An item example of beneficiary sensitivity is: &#8220;I feel guilty when I am undeservedly better off than others.&#8221; The reliabilities of perpetrator (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.82), beneficiary (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.89), and victim sensitivity (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.81) were good or even excellent; however, the reliability of observer sensitivity was questionable (Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.68).</p>
