There are cooperatively owned and operated rice mills in Cambodia, organic produce collectives in South Korea, and dairy cooperatives in South Asia. In Australia, a fledgling movement towards cooperatively owned abattoirs has emerged in the face of ever more concentrated ownership of slaughter facilities by multinationals like JBS. In the Philippines, FARMCOOP was established 30&#160;years ago to use &#8216;the country&#8217;s land reform law to become the owners of the plantations where they had labored for generations&#8217; (Bacon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). [&#8230;] At the same time, FARMCOOP has called for alternatives to the unsustainable and environmentally destructive farming technology perpetuated by those corporations&#8217;, and increasingly shifted its banana production from chemical-intensive farming to organic practices. Once its political strategies were established and succeeding in bringing peasants and other rural workers out of poverty, FARMCOOP reached out to Indigenous Peoples in Mindanao to help them establish their own cooperatives that bring together local traditions with organic agriculture.</p>
