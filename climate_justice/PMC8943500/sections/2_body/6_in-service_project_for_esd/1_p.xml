Dietlinde Willockx and Leen Dom describe an action research project that aimed to find out in what ways and with what materials childcare settings can bring &#8216;raising for a sustainable society&#8217; into a lived practice and what kind of support they need to accomplish that. The authors discuss in what ways the SDG framework provided a stepstone to overcome barriers to work on sustainability, but also how it even created new barriers.</p>
