We must listen to underrepresented voices across all racial groups. We also need to listen to the young people, to climate vulnerable states, to indigenous peoples, to women, to the scientists, to environmental defenders, and we need to ensure the global community is supportive of their needs, including action on the provision of climate finance.</p>
