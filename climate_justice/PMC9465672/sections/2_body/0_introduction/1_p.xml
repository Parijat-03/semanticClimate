Additionally, as on other continents the main livelihoods of Africa's coastal populations are dependent on farming and fishing activities and hence are highly exposed to climate change (e.g., Adger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Matera, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>).</p>
