<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0005">The energy landscape is changing dramatically. There are multiple energy &#8220;transitions&#8221; ongoing simultaneously including, <italic>inter alia:</italic> significant cost declines in wind, solar and battery storage; the closing of large quantities of coal capacity; new trade patterns for liquefied natural gas (LNG); and demand growth in Asian economies. The contours of this transition have been rendered further uncertain by the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global oil market crash in the first half of 2020. While the technical issues of these transitions are well-researched <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the social aspects of the energy transition remain both emergent and essential to a successful outcome. Communities are being impacted in different ways. Positive impacts include reductions in air pollution and new tax revenues from renewables. However, negative impacts can include lost jobs and tax revenues after closure of large fossil fuel generation facilities and coal mines as well as strains on public revenue associated with mine reclamation efforts. While economic and social issues can be addressed through thoughtful policy design, the pace of change, and the extent to which communities have a say in what comes next, matter.</p>
