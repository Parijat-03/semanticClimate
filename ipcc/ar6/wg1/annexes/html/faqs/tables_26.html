      <td>As the planet warms, climate change does not unfold uniformly across the globe, but some patterns of regional\nchange show clear, direct and consistent relationships to increases in global surface temperature. The Arctic\nwarms more than other regions, land areas warm more than the ocean surface, and the Northern Hemisphere\nmore than the Southern Hemisphere. Precipitation increases over high latitudes, tropics and large parts of\nthe monsoon regions, but decreases over the subtropics. For cases like these, we can infer the direction and\nmagnitude of some regional changes &#8211; particularly temperature and precipitation changes &#8211; for any given level</td>

Several processes\ncontribute to this high rate of warming, including increases in the absorption of solar radiation due to the loss\nof reflective sea ice and snow in a warmer world. In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctica is projected to warm\nfaster than the mid-latitude Southern Ocean, but the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes are projected to\nwarm at a reduced amplitude compared to the level of global warming (FAQ 4.3, Figure 1, left).

The differences are the result of several factors, including differences in how land and ocean areas\nabsorb and retain heat, the fact that there is more land area in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern\nHemisphere, and the influence of ocean circulation. In the Southern Hemisphere, robust patterns of relatively\nhigh warming are projected for subtropical South America, southern Africa, and Australia.
