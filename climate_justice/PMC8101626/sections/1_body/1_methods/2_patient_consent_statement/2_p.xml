<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To understand the content of tweets, we applied several natural language processing techniques. To perform topic modeling (gensim Python [version 3.6.1] package), we used an unsupervised machine learning model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) that automatically generates topics based on grouping of similar observations or tweets. We iteratively trained the model to identify the ideal number of topics and document the top 20 weighted terms that contribute to each topic. We then manually labeled each topic based on the input of both authors. Tweets can contain more than 1 topic, but there is always a single predominant topic.</p>
