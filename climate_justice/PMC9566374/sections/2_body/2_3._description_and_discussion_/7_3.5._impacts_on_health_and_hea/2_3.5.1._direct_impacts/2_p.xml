<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Extreme heat temperature has a direct effect on health by reducing the body&#8217;s thermoregulatory ability. The loss of control of internal temperature is related to a series of temperature-related illnesses such as heat syncope, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat stroke [<xref rid="B75-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Similarly, extreme temperature can also cause or aggravate cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal (including renal insufficiency) diseases, and prolonged exposure to high temperatures is associated with more hospital admissions for these causes. Extreme heat can also cause or worsen cerebrovascular and gastrointestinal (mainly in children) diseases, diabetes, mental, behavioural, and cognitive disorders and provoke premature birth, and can even lead to premature death from all the above-mentioned causes. Although cold is currently the main cause of mortality attributable to suboptimal temperatures in all countries studied, some studies already indicate that without further efforts to reverse the progress of climate change, in warmer regions such as those with a Mediterranean climate this pattern will be reversed, and heat will become the main cause of mortality attributable to suboptimal temperatures [<xref rid="B76-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In many Mediterranean cities, heat is already responsible for a large number of deaths. For example, in Barcelona, it was estimated that for the period 1992&#8211;2015, extreme temperatures resulted in more than 3500 deaths and that the risk of mortality increased by 14% in women and 4% in men when temperatures were high [<xref rid="B77-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p>
