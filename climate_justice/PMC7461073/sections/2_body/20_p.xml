<bold>Mary:</bold> While Covid&#8208;19 has affected the whole world, it has not affected the whole world equally. As with the climate crisis, in the majority of cases it is the most vulnerable people in our world who have been affected the most by the pandemic. Crises are often compounded by other economic and political challenges. Covid&#8208;19 has intensified prevailing inequalities, but it has also shown us it is possible for human behaviour to change.</p>
