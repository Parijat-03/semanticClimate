<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0050">West Nile virus circulation in Europe is usually confined to two different cycles and ecosystems: the sylvatic and the urban synanthropic cycle. Rural locations, including river deltas and floodplain areas, help create a sylvatic cycle, where wild, usually nesting wetland birds and ornithophilic mosquitoes <italic>Culex pipiens, Culex modestus, Coquillettidia richiardii</italic>) create the conditions for maintaining WNV transmission. In urban synanthropic cycles, mosquitoes, such as <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> or <italic>Culex modestus</italic>, feed on domestic birds and humans. However, these two cycles can overlap, so areas with wetlands close to human populations can be particularly vulnerable to the disease <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Irrigation from agriculture is also heavily linked to a greater incidence of human and veterinary WNV infections <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In order to represent these factors in our data set and final models, we selected land use variables (% cover) representing urban areas (metro areas), semi urban areas (lower density human settlements), wetlands and arable land.</p>
