We need governments to establish a duty of care to protect us from climate change. We can work within the system (such as legal challenges) as well as striking. We can talk to people in power on their level and frequency, and use their tools to make change. The School Strikes and other activism activities are breaking ground for young people in the future, and we have appreciation for everyone who walked before us.</p>
