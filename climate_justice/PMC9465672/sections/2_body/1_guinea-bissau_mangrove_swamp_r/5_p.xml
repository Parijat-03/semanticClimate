Moreover, new agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions have shown up gaps in the rich knowledge and skills of Guinea-Bissau's farmers. Among these new conditions, we can single out (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>; Temudo &amp; Cabral, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>; Sousa &amp; Luz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2018</xref>): a) the weakening of knowledge transmission mechanisms between generations and among ethnic groups; b) social changes (young men can study, engage in non-agricultural activities, and create their own household when still very young) that have resulted in labor constraints for the regular maintenance of the main dikes and in a major increase in the cost of labor; c) climate change, which has been increasing seawater level, the strength and height of the tides (especially spring and perigean), the irregularity of the distribution of the rains, the number of extreme events, pest attacks, and soil salinity and acidity; d) declining soil fertility and rice productivity.</p>
