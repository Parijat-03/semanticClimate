<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0010">Global disasters, from catastrophic fires in Australia to the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforce a broadly shared view that we face a planetary crisis that urgently requires stronger modes of planetary stewardship and earth system governance. Calls for immediate political action abound. The business press advocates &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221; and &#8220;carbon pricing&#8221; as &#8220;first building blocks for a new era of planetary stewardship&#8221; (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kell, 2019</xref>). Global governance experts call for &#8220;a new constitution-type agreement that will redefine the relationship between humans and the rest of the community of life&#8221; (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Young et&#160;al., 2017</xref>, 69, see also <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kotz&#233;, 2019a</xref>). Some political theorists offer an even more radical reading of the emerging landscape of planetary stewardship, arguing that a global Leviathan of some sort is likely to take shape in response to the emergent planetary crisis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wainwright and Mann, 2018</xref>). All this comes down, in short, to an increasing call for more effective planetary stewardship and transformative change towards stronger earth system governance, from local to global levels.</p>
