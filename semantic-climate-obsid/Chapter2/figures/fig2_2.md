Top-left panel: CO2 FFI emissions from: EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 11 (this dataset) (Crippa et al., 2021); GCP – Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Andrew and 12 Peters, 2021); CEDS - Community Emissions Data System (Hoesly et al., 2018; O’Rourke et al., 2021); 13 CDIAC Global, Regional, and National Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions (Gilfillan et al., 2020); PRIMAP-hist - 14 Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model for probabilistic Assessment of emissions Paths (Gütschow et al., 15 2016, 2021b); EIA - Energy Information Administration International Energy Statistics (EIA, 2021); BP - 16 BP Statistical Review of World Energy (BP, 2021); IEA - International Energy Agency (IEA, 2021a; b); 17 IPPU refers to emissions from industrial processes and product use. Top-right panel: Net anthropogenic 18 CO2-LULUCF emissions from: BLUE – Bookkeeping of land-use emissions (Hansis et al., 2015; 19 Friedlingstein et al., 2020); DGVM-mean – Multi-model mean of CO2-LULUCF emissions from dynamic 20 global vegetation models (Friedlingstein et al., 2020); OSCAR – an earth system compact model (Gasser 21 et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2020); HN – Houghton and Nassikas Bookkeeping Model (Houghton and 22 Nassikas, 2017; Friedlingstein et al., 2020); for comparison, the net CO2 flux from FAOSTAT (FAO Tier 23 1) is plotted, which comprises net emissions and removals on forest land and from net forest conversion 24 (Tubiello et al., 2021; FAOSTAT, 2021), emissions from drained organic soils under cropland/grassland 25 (Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020), and fires in organic soils (Prosperi et al., 2020), as well as a net CO2 flux 26 estimate from National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGHGI) based on country reports to the UNFCCC, 27 which include land use change, and fluxes in managed lands (Grassi et al., 2021). Bottom-left panel: 28 Anthropogenic CH4 emissions from: EDGAR (above); CEDS (above); PRIMAP-hist (above); GAINS - 29 The Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies Model (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020); 30 EPA-2019: Greenhouse gas emission inventory (US-EPA, 2019); FAO –FAOSTAT inventory emissions 31 (Tubiello et al., 2013; Tubiello, 2018; FAOSTAT, 2021); Bottom-right panel: Anthropogenic N2O 32 emissions from: GCP – global nitrous oxide budget (Tian et al., 2020); CEDS (above); EDGAR (above);
