<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The GEE for the May NDVI (<xref rid="ijerph-18-04800-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) indicates a significant and positive association with the proportion of SCs, households with assets, and households with electricity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Since the GEEs for the NDVI are not based on a logarithmic function, numbers in the Beta column represent the percentage change in the dependent variable for every one standard deviation increase in each of the independent variables (after multiplying by 100). Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of SCs, households with assets, and households with electricity is associated with 0.5%, 1.3%, and 0.8% increases in the May NDVI, respectively. A significantly negative relationship with this dependent variable (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) is indicated by the literate proportion, home ownership, and larger-sized households. A one standard deviation increase in the proportion of literate residents, households owning homes, and households of larger size is associated with 1.1%, 0.5%, and 0.8% decreases in the May NDVI, respectively.</p>
