The climate crisis is more and more taking on the character of an emergency situation and is more often being communicated as such. As a result, calls for expertocratic governance become louder. Our argument boils down to the point that we must not give in to these: not only do they turn out to be problematic shortcuts to democratic decision-making, but the long-term nature of the climate crisis makes their negative consequences for democracy even more far-reaching.</p>
