<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To measure the second dependent variable, the same 10 items from the past pro-environmental behavior scale were re-formulated as intentions for the following year (i.e., 2021). For example, one item taken from the section above reads: &#8220;In 2021, I would like to (continue to) purchase green electricity.&#8221; As we asked for behavior intentions rather than actual behavior, answers were given on 6-point scales that expressed the participant&#8217;s approval of the items (ranging from &#8220;totally disagree&#8221; to &#8220;totally agree&#8221;). The internal consistency of the scale was Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.67. The questionnaire can be found in <xref rid="S10.SS2" ref-type="sec">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
