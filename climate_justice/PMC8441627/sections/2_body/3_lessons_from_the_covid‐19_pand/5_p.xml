<p>A most fundamental problem is that humans do not think of themselves as being part of nature. We are the only species that has to consciously be aware of this basic fact and adjust our systems and lifestyles to acknowledge that &#8216;we are all related&#8217;, as Native Americans say. This includes a relationship with all other two&#8208;legged, four&#8208;legged, six&#8208;legged (insects), standing brothers (trees), etc. Diseases play an important role in limiting the population of a species so it doesn&#8217;t overrun its environment. Because we have been so successful in curing diseases, we have to consciously limit our numbers. Systems and beliefs that do not acknowledge this reality have to be changed or die&#8208;off: planet Earth can no longer tolerate them.</p>
