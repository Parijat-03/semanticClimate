,"Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 .

Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s , and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis , and human-caused climate change is likely the main driver .

Hot extremes including heatwaves have intensified in cities , where they have also worsened air pollution events  and limited functioning of key infrastructure .

,"Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); net CO2from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2- LULUCF) (green); CH4; N2O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) (light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed GHGs CO2, CH4and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4and N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH4indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850–1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C–1.5℃] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and attribution studies synthesise information from climate models and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans (panel (d)). The panel shows temperature change attributed to: total human influence; its decomposition into changes in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone and land-use change (land-use reflectance)); solar and volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges.  ",,"This figure shows the pathway from emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) to warming in the atmosphere and sea level. Carbon dioxide has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. The major GHGs are CO2 from fossil fuels combustion, industrial processes, and land use and other sources. Total human influence on temperature is estimated to have increased by about 1°C between 1850 and 2019. The warmer temperatures observed during this time period are due mostly to human activities.  Introduction This paper discusses the role of climate change in history and present-day atmospheric phenomena. It uses data from climate modeling and observations to estimate the possible effects of human activities on temperature rise from 1850 to 2019. It estimates that since 1850 there has been an average increase in annual surface temperature of around 1 °C. The warmest recent period was the Holocene, which preceded the modern era. The previous warmest was the sixteenth century according to the latest available data. In order to show the magnitude of the effect of these events, the authors include information from three main sources: Earth's upper atmosphere, ocean acidification, and solar and volcanoes.

,"12GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different GHGs in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions.

For a given GHG emissions pathway, the pathways of individual GHGs determine the resulting climate response,46whereas the choice of emissions metric47used to calculate aggregated emissions and removals of different GHGs affects what point in time the aggregated GHGs are calculated to be net zero.

To achieve net zero emissions, they use different metrics than those used for calculating net zero carbon dioxide emissions. They define net zero as (equal metric-weights of anthropogenically emitted CO2 to equivalent metric-boundless amounts of removed CO2.) In other words, their goal is to achieve an emissions level equal to or below zero"
