In any case, however, institutional design needs to ensure &#8216;throughput legitimacy&#8217; (Schmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>) by ensuring transparency and accountability. Moreover, both the act of delegation and the design of expert bodies charged with recommendations must publicly be regarded as contestable and reversible. Non-majoritarian expert bodes can only have a legitimate role in democratic decision-making processes where they are subject to scrutiny from a critical public sphere.</p>
