Specifically, issues of procedural climate justice as it relates to voice need to be more fully addressed; as Burnham <italic>et al.</italic> insist, more attention needs to be given to &#8220;who sits at the table, how they are allowed to participate, whose knowledge counts, and who gets to define the problem&#8221; because to this point, the federal and state entities have been the loudest voices [<xref rid="B114-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] (p. 245). Although this review focused on the Southeastern U.S., it was evident through the literature searches conducted that there were scant articles focused on climate change concerns and adaptive strategies targeting regional areas within larger national contexts. Researchers need to assess and develop climate change mitigation and adaption strategies, especially at the local and individual level, tailored to marginalized and vulnerable communities [<xref rid="B115-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. As globalization creates an interconnectedness with populations afar, issues of environmental justice related to climate change must continually be monitored among the poor and underrepresented in all countries, in addition to the inhabitants of less developed countries [<xref rid="B116-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>].</p>
