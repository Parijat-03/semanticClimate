<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It is well-established that climate change is the greatest global health threat of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. While the health impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss are increasing the demands on healthcare services and disrupting the provision of healthcare, the healthcare sector is simultaneously contributing to these intersecting planetary health challenges. By recent estimates, healthcare contributes to 4.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Therefore, healthcare professionals (HCPs) have a crucial responsibility to understand and address the drivers and health impacts of climate change. Developing this fundamental understanding positions HCPs to advocate for health system and practice transformations that prioritizes the health of patients, communities, and the planet.</p>
