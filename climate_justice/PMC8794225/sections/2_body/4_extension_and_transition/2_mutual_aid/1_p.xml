The popularization of mutual aid prior to COVID 19 speaks to growing material need in a starkly unequal society where social protections have been slashed. Mutual aid cuts against the core values of capitalist society that elevates individual competition in markets as the route to prosperity through economic growth. Mutual aid embodies the values of caretaking, sharing, reciprocity, and prioritizes human needs and collective well-being over profit (Spade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2020</xref>). Mutual aid creates a refuge from the free market and brings people together for a common purpose and has considerable potential to weave community bonds, expand organizational capacity, and build critical common sense while protecting the vulnerable.</p>
