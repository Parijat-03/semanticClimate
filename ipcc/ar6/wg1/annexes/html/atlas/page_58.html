However they fail to simulate the trends in monsoon rainfall and the post-1950 7 weakening of monsoon circulation (Saha et al., 2014). This is partially attributed to the failure of coarse 8 resolution (about 3&#176;) CMIP5 models in simulating fine resolution process such as orography, land surface 9 feedback and problems in cloud parameterization resulting in overestimation of convective precipitation 10 fraction (Singh et al., 2017). 11 12 Regional climate models (RCMs) were used to perform dynamical downscaling of the coarse resolution 13 CMIP5 models to higher resolution (50 km) over South Asia (called CORDEX South Asia) with improved 14 surface fields such as topography and coastlines, with the aim of better resolving the complexities of the 15 monsoon and other hydrological processes (Giorgi et al., 2009). 16 17 The added value obtained from CORDEX RCM simulations, relative to the driving GCMs, presents a 18 complex picture. Certain aspects of climate are better represented in CORDEX RCM simulations, such as 19 the spatial patterns of temperature (Sanjay et al., 2017d), and the spatial features of precipitation distribution 20 associated with the Indian summer monsoon (Choudhary et al., 2018). Clear improvements are also found in 21 simulating the active and break composite precipitation (Karmacharya et al., 2016). On the other hand, an 22 assessment of the CORDEX South Asia RCM ensemble showed that RCMs follow the driving CMIP5 23 GCMs in underestimating seasonal mean surface air temperature but overestimating spatial variability in 24 precipitation. The cold bias in the driving CMIP5 model is found to have amplified after downscaling over 25 almost the entire region, with larger magnitudes during winter season over the Hindu Khush Himalayan 26 region, Afghanistan and southwest Pakistan (Iqbal et al., 2017). Neither RCMs nor their driving CMIP5 27 GCMs reproduce well the observed climatology of precipitation (Mishra, 2015b) and temperature over the 28 Himalayan watersheds of the Indus Basin with substantial cold biases of 6&#8211;10 &#176;C (Hasson et al., 2019; 29 Nengker et al.,  2018). In addition, important characteristics of ISMR such as northward and eastward 30 propagation, onset, seasonal rainfall patterns, intra-seasonal oscillations and patterns of extremes did not 31 show consistent improvement (Singh  et al., 2017). Also, these RCM simulations have not indicated added 32 value in capturing the observed changes in ISMR characteristics over recent decades.  33 34 35 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 329.99; y1: 340.97; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="329.99" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.3.5.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="329.99" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 329.99; y1: 340.97; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">36 Summer precipitation changes in South Asia are consistent between CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections, but 37 model spread is large in winter precipitation change. Changes in the summer monsoon will dominate the 38 annual rainfall change over South Asia (Woo et al., 2019).  39 40 CMIP5 GCMs generally project increasing moisture convergence and summer monsoon precipitation over 41 South Asia with global warming (Mei et al., 2015). Under the RCP8.5 scenario, 23 CMIP5 GCMs showed an 42 increase in South Asian Monsoon precipitation due to anthropogenic climate change (Srivastava and Delsole, 43 2014).
