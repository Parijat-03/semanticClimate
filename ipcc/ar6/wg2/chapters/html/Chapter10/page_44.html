Historical trends from South Asia indicate that more lives are lost due to storm surge levels than the intensity of the cyclone (Niggol and Bakkensen, 2017). The number of people exposed to 1-in-100-years storm surge events is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam have the highest numbers of coastal populations exposed (Neumann et&#160;al., 2015) with Guangzhou, Mumbai, Shenzen, Tianjin, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata and Jakarta incurring losses of 1520&#160;million USD due to coastal flooding in 2005 alone (Dulal, 2019), although Jakarta is exposed to monsoonal storm surge. It is projected that by 2050, without adaptation, the annual losses incurred in these cities will increase to approximately 32&#160;billion USD (Dulal, 2019).</span></div><div left="42.23" right="295.97" top="462.63"><span x0="42.23" y0="462.63" x1="295.97" style="x0: 42.23; x1: 48.05; y0: 462.63; y1: 472.13; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Globally, six of the top ten countries/places with the highest AAL associated with tropical cyclones are in Asia (Japan, Republic of Korea, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Province of China, and India) (Mori et&#160;al., 2021a). The AAL associated with storm surge is primarily concentrated in Japan, China, Hong Kong SAR of China, and India. The AAL associated with wind and storm surge relative to the existing capital stock in the country is highest in New Caledonia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Palau, the Philippines, Fiji and the Solomon Islands, indicating less resilience. For example, in Ise Bay, Japan, the current storm surges are estimated to lead to property and business damage of approximately 100.04&#160;billion JPY with current adaptation (protective sea wall), but this can more than double to 236.49&#160;billion JPY under climate-change-induced increases in storm surge intensity (Jiang et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="42.23" right="135.21" top="294.65"><span style="x0: 42.23; x1: 46.79; y0: 294.65; y1: 304.15; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="42.23" y0="294.65" x1="135.21">10.4.6.3.6 Riverine floods</span></div><div left="42.23" right="295.95" top="270.66"><span x0="42.23" y0="270.66" x1="295.95" style="x0: 42.23; x1: 48.05; y0: 270.66; y1: 280.16; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Over one-third of Asian cities and about 932&#160;million urban dwellers live in areas with high risk of flooding (Gu et&#160;al., 2015).

Other countries from Asia among the top ten of absolute AALs are Japan, Bangladesh and Thailand. There is an increased flood risk for habitations on the deltas influenced by both riverine and coastal drivers of flooding (Szabo et&#160;al., 2016a), globally exposing 9.3% more people annually to riverine flooding than otherwise estimated without the compounded influence (Eilander et&#160;al., 2020). Simultaneously, SLR and subsidence are also expected to increase the risk due to frequent flood events for these delta regions than the longer-return periods otherwise associated with SLR (Yin et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="42.24" right="559.6" top="55.44"><span x0="42.24" y0="55.44" x1="559.6" style="x0: 42.24; x1: 45.6; y0: 55.44; y1: 62.44; width: 3.37; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: BGTYRB+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">6 Cumulative migration in high SLR scenarios is always higher, but since much of the migration has already occurred in earlier decades, the additional migration is lower in the high-SLR scenarios than the A1B scenario.</span></div><div left="306.43" right="560.17" top="702.6"><span x0="306.43" y0="702.6" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.43; x1: 308.72; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In Northern Eurasia, observed and projected climate-change impacts are especially pronounced. On land, the presence of permafrost, which occupies substantial areas of eastern Russia, Mongolia and mountain regions of China, creates specific challenges for economic development and human activities. By 2050, it is likely that 69% of fundamental human infrastructure in the Pan Arctic will be at risk (RCP 4.5 scenario)(</span><span style="x0: 378.56; x1: 385.42; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="378.56" y0="630.61" x1="451.07">medium confidence</span><span x0="451.07" y0="630.61" x1="560.03" style="x0: 451.07; x1: 453.71; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">), including more than 1200 settlements (Hjort et&#160;al., 2018). The majority of the population and the absolute majority (85%) of large settlements on permafrost are located in Russia, and 44% of those are expected to be profoundly affected by permafrost thaw by 2050 (Streletskiy et&#160;al., 2019; Ramage et&#160;al., 2021). Under RCP8.5, the climate-induced decrease of bearing capacity and, in regions with ice-rich permafrost, thaw subsidence, is projected to affect 54% of all residential buildings on permafrost with a combined worth of 20.7&#160;billion USD; 20% of commercial and industrial structures and 19% in critical infrastructure with a total worth of 84.4&#160;billion USD (Streletskiy, 2019). Transport infrastructure in Russia and China are impacted by thaw subsidence and, to a lesser degree, from frost heave, which add significant operational costs and limit accessibility to remote settlements (Porfiriev et&#160;al., 2019; Ni et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="306.43" right="560.14" top="438.64"><span x0="306.43" y0="438.64" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.43; x1: 310.82; y0: 438.64; y1: 448.14; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Especially in Russia, significant populations and fixed infrastructure assets are located in urban centres on permafrost that is degrading significantly. Two major risks associated with permafrost degradation are loss of permafrost bearing capacity and ground subsidence (Streletskiy et&#160;al., 2015). The former determines the ability to support foundations of buildings and structures and is a vital characteristic of sustainability of the economic centres, while the latter impacts the ability of critical infrastructure (roads, railroads) to provide transportation and support accessibility of remote populations and economic centres on permafrost. The proximity of some settlements to the coasts or areas with uneven topography may further increase risks associated with permafrost degradation as ice-rich coasts characterised by high rates of coastal erosion, while settlements located on slopes may experience higher rates of mass wasting processes.</span></div><div left="306.43" right="560.14" top="258.66"><span x0="306.43" y0="258.66" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.43; x1: 311.53; y0: 258.66; y1: 268.16; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Changes in climate have resulted in permafrost warming and increased thaw depth in undisturbed locations (Biskaborn et&#160;al., 2019), but in built up areas these transformations have been exacerbated by human activities (Grebenets et&#160;al., 2012). Norilsk, the largest city built on permafrost above the Arctic Circle (Shiklomanov et&#160;al., 2017b), was found to have one of the highest trends of near-surface permafrost warming (Streletskiy et&#160;al., 2012). Anomalous high temperatures and earlier snowmelt in 2020 may have contributed to oil storage collapse and the resulting spill of 20,000 tons of diesel fuel in Norilsk area (Rajendan et&#160;al., 2021). The ability of foundations to support structures has decreased by 10&#8211;40% relative to the 1960s in the majority of settlements on permafrost in Russia (Streletskiy et&#160;al., 2012) and is expected to further decrease by 20&#8211;33% by 2050&#8211;2059 relative to 2006&#8211;2015 (Streletskiy et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div></body></html>
