<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al. (2019)</xref> argued for more work by geographers to interrogate ways of connecting everyday legal activities and &#8220;the <italic>trans</italic>-scalar structural machinations of state violence.&#8221; Indeed, to situate the spatial politics of courts, multiple spaces need to be seen as interconnected. On one occasion, after a court session finished, four fellow courtroom observer-companions and I travelled together from the courthouse in downtown Vancouver to a NEB hearing in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, to see a parallel space of pipeline politics &#8211; where efforts were afoot by the Federal Government to pressure Indigenous leaders who opposed the pipeline. NEB hearings took place in a conference venue where Indigenous groups had to travel considerable distance to make presentations. Some Indigenous leaders lambasted this venue as an insulting &#8220;Hilton Hotel version&#8221; inappropriate for oral traditional evidence &#8211; highly inaccessible and not open to the public or easily open to Indigenous communities, reflecting the government's poor commitment to genuine consultation. Our seeing this &#8216;sterilized&#8217; NEB environment thus further contextualized the courthouse space. My approach was thus not just about studying the courtroom as a space in itself but also as a nodal point for interacting and interpreting wider events, places of contention and processes unfolding, and seeing solidarities and affects that challenge oil and the dominance of colonialism in governance and judicial systems.</p>
