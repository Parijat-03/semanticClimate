<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">To address climate change mitigation for air travel, a growing body of literature considers its disproportionate impact (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Brand and Boardman, 2008</xref>). There is an attitude and behavioral gap when it comes to individual considerations for air travel (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Bel &amp; Rosell, 2017</xref>). Even people who are concerned about climate change appear unwilling to change their travel behavior or purchase offsets, developing rationalizations to justify their own air travel (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Brouwer, Brander, &amp; Van Beukering, 2008</xref>). Air travelers cite professional development (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Wynes &amp; Donner, 2018</xref>), positive social benefits from experiencing new cultures, and leisure benefits as reasons for continued flight (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Becken, 2007</xref>), which are all personal, as opposed to collective, reasons that lead to unwillingness to compromise air travel (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boucher, 2017</xref>).</p>
