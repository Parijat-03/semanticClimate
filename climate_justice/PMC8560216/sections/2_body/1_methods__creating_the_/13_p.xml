The weekly, non-serial podcast launched in February 2020. Within two months of the launch, the scope of the target audience was expanded, based on the information and trends gathered through social media platforms, primarily Instagram. It was observed that there are influencers, such as adaptive athlete Vasu Sojitra (vasusojitra.com), who represents disabled and queer communities and uses their platforms to educate and raise awareness about their experiences interacting with the natural environment and how they are impacted by environmental degradation and climate change. Therefore, these guests were added to the list of possible interviewees, which is constantly expanding.</p>
