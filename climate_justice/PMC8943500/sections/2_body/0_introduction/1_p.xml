The <italic>Agenda 2030</italic> was an urgent call for rapid and collective action in order to both mitigate climate change and ensure that all humans have access to basic safety, health and education as well as a possibility to live a prosperous life void of injustices and inequalities (United Nations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). The UNSDGs were defined as targets with indicators to be reached and each goal has been more precisely described in several policy documents (UNESCO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p>
