      <td>As per the FRA, the forest rights shall be conferred free of all encumbrances and procedural requirements. Furthermore, without the\nFRA&#8217;s provision for getting the informed consent of local communities for both diversion of community forest land and for reforestation,\nthere would be legal and administrative hurdles in using existing forest land for implementation of India&#8217;s ambitious Green India\nMission that aims to respond to climate change by a combination of adaptation and mitigation measures in the forestry sector. It aims\nto increase forest/tree cover to the extent of 5 million hectares (Mha) and improve quality of forest/tree cover on another 5 Mha of\nforest/non-forest lands and support forest-based livelihoods of 3 million families and generate co-benefits through ES (Government\nof India 2010).</td>

      <td>Thus, the community forest land recognised under FRA can be used for the purpose of compensatory afforestation or restoration\nunder REDD+ only with informed consent of the communities and a decentralised mechanism for using CAMPA funds. India&#8217;s forest\nand forest restoration can potentially move away from a top-down carbon centric model with the effective participation of local\ncommunities (Vijge and Gupta 2014; Murthy et al. 2018a).</td>

      <td>India has also experimented with the world&#8217;s first national inter-governmental ecological fiscal transfer (EFT) from central to local and\nstate government to reward them for retaining forest cover. In 2014, India&#8217;s 14th Finance Commission added forest cover to the\nformula that determines the amount of tax revenue the central government distributes annually to each of India&#8217;s 29 states. It is\nestimated that, in four years, it would have distributed 6.9&#8211;12 billion USD per year to states in proportion to their 2013 forest cover,\namounting to around 174&#8211;303 USD per hectare of forest per year (Busch and Mukherjee 2017). State governments in India now have\na sizeable fiscal incentive based on extent of forest cover at the time of policy implementation, contributing to the achievement of\nIndia&#8217;s climate mitigation and forest conservation goals. India&#8217;s tax revenue distribution reform has created the world&#8217;s first EFTs for\nforest conservation, and a potential model for other countries. However, it is to be noted that EFT is calculated based on a one-time\nestimate of forest cover prior to policy implementation, hence does not incentivise ongoing protection and this is a policy gap. It&#8217;s still\ntoo early but its impact on trends in forest cover in the future and its ability to conserve forests without other investments and policy\ninstruments is promising but untested (Busch and Mukherjee 2017; Busch 2018).</td>

      <td>In order to build on the new promising policy developments on forest rights and fiscal incentives for forest conservation in India,\nincentivising ongoing protection, further investments in monitoring (Busch 2018), decentralisation (Somanathan et al. 2009) and\npromoting diverse non-agricultural forest and range of land-based livelihoods (e.g., sustainable non-timber forest product extraction,\nregulated pastures, carbon credits for forest regeneration on marginal agriculture land and ecotourism revenues) as part of individual\nand community forest tenure and rights are ongoing concerns. Decentralised sharing of CAMPA funds between government and local\ncommunities for forest restoration as originally suggested and filling in implementation gaps could help reconcile climate change\nmitigation through forest conservation, REDD+ and environmental justice (Vijge and Gupta 2014; Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013;\nBadola et al. 2013; Sun and Chaturvedi 2016; Murthy et al. 2018b; Chopra 2017; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change,\nand Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India 2010).</td>
