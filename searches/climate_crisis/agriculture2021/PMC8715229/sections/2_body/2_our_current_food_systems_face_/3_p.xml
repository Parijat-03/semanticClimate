<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0145">This development has been accompanied by an increasing integration of markets. Between 2000 and 2016 the global value of trade increased threefold, reflecting changing patterns of consumption, the rising influence of emerging economies, and the growing trade in food products between developed countries (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2018</xref>). There is a widening gap between net exporting and net importing regions, with agricultural exports tending to originate from a relatively small number of countries and the distribution of imports being more widespread (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2018</xref>). A rising number of countries are dependent on imports for their food security, while sometimes only a few countries dominate the market for a particular commodity. In several developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates have outpaced agricultural productivity gains&#8212;contrary to the global picture&#8212;and a growing trade deficit in agricultural commodities is being observed. The most populated African countries have become net grain importers (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix, 2016</xref>).</p>
