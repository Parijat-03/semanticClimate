Such advanced monitoring can be facilitated through real-time engagement via ubiquitous digital devices such as smartphones. Smartphones can serve as tools of equity by amplifying the voices of isolated citizens and communities, as well as providing citizens with timely access to resources and information [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>-<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Community-based data collection improves monitoring and adaptation to environmental changes as Indigenous communities have a wealth of knowledge and experience in coping with environmental changes [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>-<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The integration of Western methods and Traditional Knowledge using Two-Eyed Seeing approaches is critical for developing and implementing climate change solutions in partnership with Indigenous communities [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>-<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
