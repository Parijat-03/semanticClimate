<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We are
excited to hear that the team at ACS is running a series
of webinars throughout Open Access Week, accompanied by the launch
of a new &#8220;journey to open science&#8221; tool that we encourage
you to explore. Using this tool, participants can identify which open
science workflows they have already adopted and are provided with
guidance on how to take their next steps in working toward a more
open future. If you would like to join in, you can find more information
on the ACS Open Science Web site.</p>
