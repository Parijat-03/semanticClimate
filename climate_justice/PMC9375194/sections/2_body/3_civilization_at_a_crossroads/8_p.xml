The article, &#8220;How Climate Migration Will Reshape America,&#8221; presents the thoroughgoing findings of more than four dozen experts, including economists, demographers, climate scientists, insurance executives, architects, and urban planners, in order to construct computer projections of &#8220;the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years.&#8221; &#8220;What I found,&#8221; writes Lustgarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>), &#8220;was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation,&#8221; with computer models projecting that &#8220;some 162&#160;million people&#8212;nearly 1 in 2&#8212;will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environments, namely more heat and less water.&#8221; To say that this is fast becoming a pivotal and defining moment for the nation, not to mention for the rest of the world, would be something of an understatement. Lustgarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) adds that &#8220;for 93&#160;million of them, the changes could be particularly severe, and by 2070, our analysis suggests, if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels, at least 4&#160;million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe, in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life.&#8221; But much sooner than 2070&#8212;according to U.S. government projections, by 2040&#8212;extreme water shortages west of the Missouri River will already have become &#8220;nearly ubiquitous&#8221; (Lustgarten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>).</p>
