<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0145">To deflect Indigenous rights issues, oil industry promoters have sought to legitimize the contested TMX project by stating that it is &#8220;just&#8221; a &#8220;twinning&#8221; of a pre-existing pipeline built in 1951 along with some new routes. This argument rests on the premise that theft of a violent colonial &#8216;past&#8217; era justifies ongoing and new dispossession and new destruction. It also assumes that denying Indigenous jurisdiction is an acceptable way of doing &#8216;development&#8217;. As some defendants sought to remind the BC judge during the injunction hearings, in 1951 government systems were also in place to overtly continue genocide and forcibly take Indigenous children from their parents and put them in residential schools to extinguish their culture (see also <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">De Leeuw, 2016</xref>); for this and a host of other racist colonial practices, &#8220;dispossession was the goal&#8221; (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Manuel &amp; Derrickson, 2017</xref>). Revisiting histories such as those in the above statement to the court, multiple people on trial noted the existence of Indigenous law and queried the court why they were not being adjudicated according to <italic>these</italic> laws. Statements to the judge by an artist and arrestee, spoke of Indigenous legal practices engaging oral traditions, efforts by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation at regenerating sustainable futures, and Kinder Morgan's illegal activities on the land as already witnessed: &#8220;<italic>Our actions at Kinder Morgan's gates were necessary</italic>,&#8221; his statement noted, &#8220;<italic>to help press the pause button until real justice is restored.</italic>&#8221;</p>
