<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par42">Having eliminated the IOD and SOI as important covariates in the location parameter for modeling the lake level AMS, the study then investigated the combined influences of evaporation, rainfall, and discharge on the location parameter (AMS<sub>6</sub> to AMS<sub>9</sub> in Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). The results have shown that AMS<sub>3</sub> (evaporation-based model) was still the best model, and the other two covariates (rainfall and discharge) may therefore add some value to the location parameter of this model. Consequently, AMS<sub>3</sub> was considered to be nested in AMS<sub>6</sub> and AMS<sub>7</sub>. In addition, AMS<sub>1</sub> was considered to be nested in AMS<sub>8</sub>, since the based model was the second best. The results in Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> show that AMS<sub>7</sub> (combining evaporation and discharge) was the best performer of the three, with the lowest AIC, BIC, and NLL values. However, none of these demonstrated through the LR test that the addition of a covariate would improve the performance of the nested model as all <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0. Finally, AMS<sub>9</sub> (combing all three covariates) fails short of being the best model according to the AIC, BIC, and NLL values shown in Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>. The LR test was therefore used with AMS<sub>9</sub> and against AMS<sub>6</sub>, AMS<sub>7</sub>, and AMS<sub>8</sub>. The best (lowest) <italic>p</italic> value of 0.0018 for LR test was only found when AMS<sub>8</sub> was nested within AMS<sub>9</sub>. The implication is that only the addition of evaporation would be of some value in the performance of each of the combined models. The estimated models for the location parameter with combined covariates, the estimated constrained scale (<italic>&#963;</italic>) and shape parameters (<italic>&#958;</italic>), and their standard errors (<italic>se</italic>) are also shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. Physically, models AMS<sub>1</sub> and AMS<sub>2</sub> show the additive effects of rainfall and discharge to the location parameter, whereas AMS<sub>3</sub> to AMS<sub>5</sub> suggests the respective subtractive effects of evaporation, IOD, and SOI on the location parameter. In addition, the study also found that there were no significant improvements in the performance of each of these 9 NSFA models when log link functions were used in the scale parameter(&#8709;&#8201;=&#8201;log(<italic>&#963;</italic>)).<table-wrap id="Tab10"><label>Table 10</label><caption><p>Test results for models with covariates in the scale parameter (<inline-formula id="IEq29"><alternatives><tex-math id="M69">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
