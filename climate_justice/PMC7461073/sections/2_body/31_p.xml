<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Nature and biodiversity are under threat. The restoration and protection of biodiversity, however, can be an action that governments take as they come through the Covid&#8208;19 pandemic. The EU, for instance, has a 10&#8208;year plan to protect at least 30 per cent of EU land and seas by 2030. As an ambassador for the Campaign for Nature I want to see this target taken up around the world to secure a better future for the planet, its wildlife and ourselves.</p>
