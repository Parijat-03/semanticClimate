For instance, one can potentially lower the threshold to such a level that more can reach it. However, this would be a curious suggestion given that capabilities ought to be consistent with the type of &#8216;being&#8217; they refer to and the value and needs of that &#8216;being&#8217;. It would be as if one is justifying <italic>less</italic> dignity to persons. However, even if we assume that the threshold level should reflect the type of &#8216;being&#8217; that humans are, and their moral worth and sociability, there is some flexibility in where to set the threshold (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 403). While it may be obvious that some activities, such as pleasure-driving SUVs, are well beyond thresholds (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 403), it is not immediately clear where to set the threshold.</p>
