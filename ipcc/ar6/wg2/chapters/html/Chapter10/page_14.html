Furthermore, migration does not necessarily mean that people move out of risk; in fact, often they might be subjected to new risks. Notably, migrants in South and Southeast Asia have been severely affected by the compounding crises of disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is emerging evidence that inclusion of universal safety-net provisions that embed adaptation planning can reduce vulnerabilities of migrants (Sengupta and Jha, 2020; Cundill et&#160;al., 2021; Sultana, 2021).</span></div><div left="56.41" right="107.35" top="630.61"><span x0="56.41" y0="630.61" x1="107.35" style="x0: 56.41; x1: 63.97; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">While there is </span><span style="x0: 106.98; x1: 109.79; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="106.98" y0="630.61" x1="165.69">robust evidence </span><span x0="165.32" y0="630.61" x1="167.96" style="x0: 165.32; x1: 167.96; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(</span><span style="x0: 167.96; x1: 174.82; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="167.96" y0="630.61" x1="237.75">medium agreement</span><span x0="237.75" y0="630.61" x1="545.93" style="x0: 237.75; x1: 240.39; y0: 630.61; y1: 640.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) that migration exacerbates gendered vulnerability and work burdens (Banerjee et&#160;al., 2019; Singh, 2019; Rao et&#160;al., 2020), it is well established that differential vulnerability of migrants intersects with ethnicity, age and gender; political networks and social capital; and livelihoods in destination areas (Maharjan et&#160;al., 2020; Cundill et&#160;al., 2021). Across Asia, international and internal migration are changing social norms and household structures, with significant implications for local adaptive capacity (Singh, 2019; Evertsen and van der Geest, 2020; Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020; Rao et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="56.41" right="123.58" top="715.47"><span style="x0: 56.41; x1: 60.82; y0: 715.47; y1: 723.97; width: 4.41; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="56.41" y0="715.47" x1="123.58">Box&#160;10.2 (continued)</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.47" top="534.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="534.6" x1="296.47" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The current energy structure of Asia is dominated by fossil fuels. As the trend indicates, the share of coal in China&#8217;s primary energy consumption is forecasted to sharply decline from 60% in 2017 to around 35% in 2040 (BP, 2019). In contrast, India and ASEAN rely more on coal since coal may meet their soaring energy demand. Accordingly, more than 80% of the global coal will be consumed in Asia by 2050. China will surpass the USA in about 10&#160;years to become the world&#8217;s largest oil consumer. India will then replace the USA to be the second largest by the late 2040s (IEEJ, 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.48" top="414.62"><span x0="42.52" y0="414.62" x1="296.48" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 414.62; y1: 424.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Around 60% of the incremental electricity demand globally, predicted to double by 2050, will occur in Asia. By that time, the electrification rate will increase to 30%, but 40% of electricity demand will be still covered by coal (IEEJ, 2018). Asia accounts for almost half of the growth in global renewable power generation. It is hardly possible for Japan and Republic of Korea to develop additional nuclear power plants as planned, whereas nuclear generation continues to increase quickly in China and the scale will be similar to the entire generation of OECD by 2040 (BP, 2019). India and Russia&#8217;s nuclear power sectors are also growing fast (e.g., the recent launch of the Akademik Lomonosov offshore nuclear power plant in Russia).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.44" top="270.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="270.63" x1="296.44" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 270.63; y1: 280.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The rapid growth of energy demand in Asia reinforces the region&#8217;s position as the largest energy importer (BP, 2019). Around 80% of energy traded globally will be consumed in Asia, and the rate of self-sufficiency will decrease from 72 to 63% by 2050. This tendency is especially remarkable for ASEAN, which will become a net importer in the early 2020s. The self-sufficiency rate of coal will be maintained at a level of 80%, while that of oil and natural gas will decline significantly. The additional oil imports of the emerging Asian economies will be from North America, the Middle East and North Africa. The main players in Asia for the liquefied natural gas imports will extend from Japan and Republic of Korea to China and India. ASEAN has been a net exporter of natural gas but starts to expand its importation due to the increased consumption and resource depletion (IEEJ, 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.47" top="102.66"><span x0="42.52" y0="102.66" x1="296.47" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 102.66; y1: 112.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The increase in energy demand at a rapid rate in these countries thus cannot be attributed only to population growth and rising living standards, but also to increasingly extreme temperature variations.

Similarly, energy systems are influenced by the way the agriculture sector, mainly in Al Mashrek, relies increasingly on energy-intensive methods (e.g., more fertilisers, different irrigation and harvesting patterns) (Farajalla, 2013).</span></div><div left="306.19" right="560.14" top="462.67"><span x0="306.19" y0="462.67" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.19; x1: 311.29; y0: 462.67; y1: 472.17; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on energy and industrial systems. It has a particularly wide and profound impact on energy systems (energy development, transportation, supply, etc.). With global warming, the energy consumption for heating in winter decreases, while the energy consumption for cooling in summer significantly increases, but the overall energy demand shows an upwards trend (</span><span style="x0: 362.45; x1: 367.03; y0: 390.68; y1: 400.18; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="362.45" y0="390.68" x1="419.09">high confidence</span><span x0="419.09" y0="390.68" x1="560.14" style="x0: 419.09; x1: 421.74; y0: 390.68; y1: 400.18; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Sailor, 2001; Szabo et&#160;al., 2018). Such demands in summer seasons will by far exceed any energy savings from the decrease in heating demand due to warmer winters.&#160;Higher demand for cooling due to hotter temperatures has become a major challenge in the energy sector in all countries. Furthermore, decreased water levels due to lower precipitation reduces hydroelectric output. This is particularly the case for countries such as Syria and Iraq with large hydroelectric capacity (Hamid and Raouf, 2009). Additionally, the decrease in water levels negatively affects low-carbon energy systems such as concentrated solar power and thermal-generation plants that require regular cooling and cleaning.</span></div><div left="306.19" right="560.17" top="246.69"><span x0="306.19" y0="246.69" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.19; x1: 311.29; y0: 246.69; y1: 256.19; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate change adds extra pressure to current energy infrastructures in most countries where systems failures and blackouts are already common (Assaf, 2009). In the wake of extreme weather events (e.g., heatwaves), energy infrastructures remain inadequate to cope. This is particularly the case for countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine, with poor electricity infrastructures (Jordan, 2015). Extreme weather events could generate grave damage to power plants, most being located only a few metres above sea level, as well as power-transmission towers and lines. In Lebanon, a small country where there are no Indigenous energy resources, the disruption of shipping of fuel supplies due to extreme weather events is a major risk. Other extreme weather events, such as floods and sandstorms, expose energy and industrial systems in the coastal areas due to a rise in sea level. Countries of the Arabian Peninsula are projected to experience significant inland flooding as sea levels rise (Hamid and Raouf, 2009). In East Asia wet snow accretion enhanced by global warming often causes damage to electric power lines (Sakamoto, 2000; Ohba and Sugimoto, 2020).</span></div></body></html>
