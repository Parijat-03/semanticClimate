This view feeds the willful ignorance we see with COVID-19: a dismissal and ill preparedness. The science and evidence are clear: climate shocks continue to appear and&#8212;as temperatures rise&#8212;are expected to become more frequent and more severe. Their effects might be local, regional, or global. We should contemplate and consider the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to better prepare economies and societies for climate shocks.</p>
