This three-item scale was included as a covariate both to be consistent with prior research on this topic (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>) and to facilitate examination of&#160;associations between CCA and mental health symptoms above and beyond participants&#8217; direct climate change exposure. The scale assessed the extent to which individuals have experienced the impacts of climate change (e.g., &#8220;I have been directly affected by climate change&#8221;; Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Responses were reported using a Likert scale, with response options ranging from 1&#8201;=&#8201;Disagree completely to 5&#8201;=&#8201;Agree completely. Mean scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating greater experience with the impacts of climate change. Reliability was acceptable (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.79).</p>
