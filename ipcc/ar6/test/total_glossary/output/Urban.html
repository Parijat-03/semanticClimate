Urban areas exist on a continuum with rural areas and tend to exhibit higher levels of complexity, higher populations and population density, intensity of capital investment, and a preponderance of secondary (processing) and tertiary (service) sector industries. The extent and intensity of these features varies significantly within and between urban areas. Urban places and systems are open with much movement and exchange between more rural areas as well as other urban regions. Urban areas can be globally interconnected facilitating rapid flows between them &#8211; of capital investment, of ideas and culture, human migration, and disease.</p></div></dd><div>
