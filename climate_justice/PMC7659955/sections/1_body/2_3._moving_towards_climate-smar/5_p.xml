[<xref rid="B79-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] used crop simulation models; version 0810 of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model [<xref rid="B80-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and version 4.0 of the so-called DSSAT, an acronym for Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer [<xref rid="B81-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], respectively. It was observed that these software simulations that gave ideas on cultivar improvement and optimization of management practices for rice due to climate change, led to increased rice production. The EPIC models specifically yielded over 2000 kgha<sup>&#8722;1</sup> during the 30-year period under review [<xref rid="B79-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. </p>
