Others have specifically examined climate change from a children&#8217;s rights perspective and how this has been leveraged in litigation.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Despite this work, there has been little examination of young people&#8217;s efforts through the lens of an HRBA and its operational principles.</p>
