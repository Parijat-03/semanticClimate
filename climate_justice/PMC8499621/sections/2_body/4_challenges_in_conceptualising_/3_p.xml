<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Berry et al (2018) proposed that a systems approach that accounts for interrelated and interdependent factors, forming a complex whole, is important for future research thinking and leadership around climate change and mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We argue that this approach should also accommodate a structural and intersectional understanding of pre-existing inequalities in mental health. This may come from approaches which address broader inter-penetrative global socioeconomic processes such as globalisation,<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and the syndemics model of health that focuses on &#8216;interacting, co-present or sequential diseases and the social and environmental factors that promote and enhance the negative effects of disease interaction&#8217;.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
