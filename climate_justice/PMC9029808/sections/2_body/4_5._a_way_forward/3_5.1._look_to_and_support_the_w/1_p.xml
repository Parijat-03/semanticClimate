With the urgency to mitigate climate change impacts, young people have recognized the need for imminent action, and have mobilized through community action, legal pursuits, and confrontation with State and corporate emitters. Youth-led climate interventions that have held heavy emitters accountable through legal avenues of recourse and advocacy, provide useful insights for health, climate, and human rights scholars and practitioners to adopt similar approaches to reconcile human rights violations and public health threats incurred by the climate crisis. In particular, the intersection of human rights and health discussed in the sections above reveals how the impacts of climate change can be attenuated by focusing on justice and building the resilience of the most vulnerable, including children and young people. Supporting young people through funding, capacity building, collaborative research projects, employment, and opportunities to meaningfully engage in decision making can foster the pursuit of holistic and integrated approaches to climate action.</p>
