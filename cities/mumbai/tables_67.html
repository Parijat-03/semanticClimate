      <td>Approximately 60% of Mumbai&#8217;s population\nlive within walking distance of 1km from a daily\nurban recreation space.\nOpen spaces are critical for physical and\nmental health. During disaster events, open\nspaces serve as grounds for evacuation, rescue\nand recovery. During slow onset events, such as\nextreme summers or heat waves, well-shaded\nopen spaces can offer poor and more exposed\ncommunities (such as those living in informal\nsettlements) essential respite from extreme\nindoor heat stress.\nThe populations with limited access to open\nspaces are at higher risk and more vulnerable.</td>

      <td>A high percentage of Mumbai residents live in\nstructurally unstable/compromised houses.\nThe roof is the largest exposed area of a house.\nAs compared with walls and floors,\nconstructing a structurally stable and safe roof\nbuilt of concrete, burnt brick or machine-made\ntiles costs more. Hence, houses with roofs made\nof material such as thatch, mud, polythene and\nasbestos are more vulnerable to extreme\nweather conditions (such as heavy rainfall,\nstrong winds and heat waves), thereby exposing\nthe residents to a greater risk to\nclimate-induced hazards.\nPoor housing conditions result in increased risk\nand vulnerability.</td>
