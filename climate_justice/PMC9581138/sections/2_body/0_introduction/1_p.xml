<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Citizen Science (CS) is a growing phenomenon within scientific research, in which lay or non-scientists volunteer in scientific research activities. Well-known CS activities include butterfly counts, birdwatching, and monitoring air and water quality. Such projects have demonstrated the &#8220;power of the crowd&#8221; in delivering scientific, policy and social impact (Shirk et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Turrini et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The vast potential of CS has been demonstrated extensively in large scale projects which are mediated through online communities or apps that can accommodate many volunteers. Projects such as &#8220;Galaxy Zoo&#8221; which asks participants to visually classify pictures of galaxies, are quite successful regarding their scientific outcome (Golumbic et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Apart from a high number of publications, the results are valuable for further research, for example the exploration of &#8220;Hanny's Voorwerp&#8221; in Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p>
