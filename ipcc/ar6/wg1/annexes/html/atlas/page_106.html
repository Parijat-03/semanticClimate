This leads to inconsistencies 25 between observational datasets. Precipitation estimates over the Arctic Ocean are particularly uncertain as  26 they mainly rely on reanalyses or observationally-constrained products such as the merged gridded datasets 27 combining gauge measurements and satellite estimates &#8211; such as GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology 28 Centre, Schneider et al., 2014), CMAP (CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation, Xie and Arkin, 1996), GPCP 29 (Global Precipitation Climatology Project, Adler et al., 2003) &#8211; which are not well constrained over the 30 poorly observed Arctic Ocean. Reanalyses also suffer from sparse observations over the central Arctic and 31 thus their precipitation estimates depends largely on the atmospheric model used, its resolution and 32 parametrizations, and estimates for the Arctic can differ by more than 50% (Boisvert et al., 2018). A newer 33 satellite products, CloudSat, has recently become available, but it could also be biased as it is very sensitive 34 to light rain and snowfall (Behrangi et al., 2016). The lack of reliable precipitation observation datasets for 35 the Arctic thus makes it </span><span style="x0: 163.92; x1: 166.98; y0: 329.09; y1: 340.07; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="163.92" y0="329.09" x1="190.43">likely </span><span x0="190.44" y0="329.09" x1="41.45" style="x0: 190.44; x1: 193.5; y0: 329.09; y1: 340.07; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">impossible to evaluate objectively the skill of models to reproduce 36 precipitation patterns (Takhsha et al., 2018). 37 38 CMIP5 models reasonably reproduce the observed Arctic warming during the long 1900&#8211;2005 (Hao et al., 39 2018) and 1900&#8211;2014 (Chylek et al., 2016) periods. The simulated mean (40 CMIP5 models) Arctic (north 40 of 64&#176;N) warming over the 1900&#8211;2014 period is 2.7&#176;C compared to the observed values of 2.2&#176;C (NASA 41 GISS data smoothed using a 1200-km radius) or 1.7&#176;C (using a 250-km smoothing radius) (Chylek et al., 42 2016). However, a large inter-model difference in the simulated warming magnitudes is obvious and ranges 43 from 1.2&#176;C to 5.0&#176;C. Although the CMIP5 models reasonably reproduce the observed warming over the past 44 50 to 100 years, the spatial pattern is quite different from that of observations and reanalysis (Xie et al., 45 2016; Franzke et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2018). The zonal mean temperature trends indicate that the CMIP5 46 models overestimate the warming in the cold season over high latitudes in the northern hemisphere (Xie et 47 al., 2016). Possible reasons are modelled sea surface temperature biases and an overestimated temperature 48 response to the Arctic sea-ice decline. Furthermore, some models, which have a warm or weak bias in their 49 Arctic temperature simulations, closely relate the Arctic warming to changes in the large-scale atmospheric 50 circulation. In other models, which show large cold biases, the albedo feedback effect plays a more 51 important role for the temperature trend magnitude. This stark difference in model biases might indicate that 52 the dominant Arctic warming mechanism and trend may be dependent on the bias of the model mean state 53 (Franzke et al., 2017). 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
