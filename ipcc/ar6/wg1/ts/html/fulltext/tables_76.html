      <td>Since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events has emerged as a growing field of climate research with an increasing body of\nliterature. It provides evidence that greenhouse gases and other external forcings have affected individual extreme weather events\nby disentangling anthropogenic drivers from natural variability. Event attribution is now an important line of evidence for assessing\nchanges in extremes on regional scales. (Section TS.1) {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 11.1.4}</td>

      <td>The regional extremes and events that have been studied are geographically uneven (Section TS.4.1). A few events, for example,\nextreme rainfall events in the United Kingdom, heatwaves in Australia, or Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas in 2017, have been heavily\nstudied. Many highly impactful extreme weather events have not been studied in the event attribution framework, particularly in\nthe developing world where studies are generally lacking. This is due to various reasons, including lack of observational data, lack of\nreliable climate models, and lack of scientific capacity. While the events that have been studied are not representative of all extreme\nevents that have occurred, and results from these studies may also be subject to selection bias, the large number of event attribution\nstudies provide evidence that changes in the properties of these local and individual events are in line with expected consequences\nof human influence on the climate and can be attributed to external drivers. {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 11.1.4, 11.2.2}</td>

      <td>It is very likely that human influence is the main contributor to the observed increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and\nthe observed decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes on continental scales. Some specific recent hot extreme events\nwould have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system. Changes in aerosol concentrations\nhave likely slowed the increase in hot extremes in some regions, in particular from 1950&#8211;1980. No-till farming, irrigation and crop\nexpansion have similarly attenuated increases in summer hot extremes in some regions, such as central North America (medium\nconfidence). {11.3.4}</td>
