<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Recently, the Public Climate School (PCS), a multi-component school-based programme aiming to promote climate awareness and action among school students, has been developed and offered in collaboration with public schools in Germany to approximately 30,000 students each year since 2019 by Students for Future, an offshoot of the Fridays for Future movement. The content and delivery of the PCS is guided by the concept of ESD [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and focuses on, inter alia, participatory teaching and learning methods, critical thinking and imagining future scenarios [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The PCS is a complex intervention comprising several interacting components, such as live online lessons, interactive workshops and peer exchange sessions, and engages different stakeholder groups including students, teachers, school principals and the team implementing the PCS. Anticipated effects, potentially influenced by a variety of contextual factors, include increased individual and collective efficacy beliefs, increased identification with civil society groups involved in climate action and pro-environmental behavioural intentions of students. To date, however, an evaluation of this programme has not been undertaken.</p>
