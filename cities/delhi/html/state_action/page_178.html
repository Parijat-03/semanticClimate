In rural areas Rural Electrification Corporation is responsible for helping set-up small power plants under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana. This central scheme is being implemented by the Delhi government. According to the 2001 census the number of un-electrified rural households stand at 24,580 i.e. 14.5% of the rural households. In Delhi the rural population account for just 2.50% of the total population of 167.88 Lakh which is not significant. These areas are distributed over Delhi and initiating rural power scheme to set-up an independent power plant for these areas seems economically unfeasible at the moment. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="146.35"><span x0="72.02" y0="146.35" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 146.35; y1: 158.35; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi was the first State/UT to introduce kVAh billing for bulk consumers, to motivate them to maintain the power factor, and it is DERC&#8217;s policy to gradually expand the coverage of consumers under kVAh billing.
