<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Survey respondents include individuals who submitted the premodule and postmodule survey and answered the validation question(s) on the surveys correctly (<italic>n</italic>&#160;=&#160;120 in semester 2017, <italic>n</italic>&#160;=&#160;263 in semester 2018). The number of enrolled students was 581 in semester 2017 and 588 in semester 2018. The class was 70% female in 2017 and 69% in 2018. Thus, the female skew in the responses likely results, in part, from the demographic makeup of the class.</p>
