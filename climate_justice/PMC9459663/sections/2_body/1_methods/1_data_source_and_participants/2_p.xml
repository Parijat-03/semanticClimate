<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We included all eligible DHS from 2005 to 2017 (eTable in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220857-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>) that included HIV testing and geolocated information on each enumeration area. We only included surveys that evaluated the outcomes and covariates of interest selected from nationally representative samples and included variation in heavy rainfall exposure in the study window. The study was conducted from July 29, 2021, to June 14, 2022. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. Because all data were obtained from published literature, this study does not constitute human participant research and does not require institutional review board review or exemption according to the US Department of Health and Human Services (45 CFR &#167;46).</p>
