(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>), most communities interlinked to the ecovillage movement, resemble those of the &#8220;Global North,&#8221; and composed of privileged social groups with a homogenous profile, which is mainly middle or upper middle class, ethnically &#8220;white,&#8221; with higher education levels. Despite the frequently expressed interest in diversity, &#8220;apparently, there is no significant link between traditional communities and the ecovillage movement in Brazil, although it is possible to consider them &#8216;entities&#8217; that are alike in many aspects&#8221; (Dias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>, p. 83). Maybe this shows that, in some ways, there is room for future agencies and straightening relationships between ecovillages and other grassroots community-led alternatives in the &#8220;Global South&#8221; at the local and regional levels, as illustrated by the confluence between the Instituto Biorregional do Cerrado (IBC), an Ecovillage and Permaculture Center, and the largest Quilombola<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> territory in Brazil called Kalunga. Both are located in a Brazilian rural area in the Cerrado<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> biome, a biodiversity world hotspot endangered by the advance of the agribusiness frontier for large-scale monoculture commodities production (mostly soybean and corn) and are together engaging in the local political struggles in the decision-making arena, resisting along 20 years, against the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the traditional territory (Roysen and Schwab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2021</xref>).</p>
