Section&#160;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> surveys different aspects of energy justice, primarily the relation between well-being and energy consumption. Section&#160;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> presents the CA, including both thresholds and ceilings. This is followed by an application of the framework to energy justice and a short summary in Sects.&#160;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">4</xref> and <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, respectively. After defining capability thresholds and ceilings we define the distance between thresholds and ceilings. We argue that the distance between the threshold and the ceiling for each generation diminishes as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. This means that a non-tragic choice now shades into a tragic choice later. The CA, supplemented with ceilings, will be proposed as a reasonable theory for energy justice and defining what energy justice requires in practice.</p>
