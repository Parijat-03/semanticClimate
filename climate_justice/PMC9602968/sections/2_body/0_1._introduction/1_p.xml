Extreme events such as heat waves, wildfires, and drought, projected to increase in frequency, duration, and magnitude in coming years [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], alongside more gradual changes (e.g., sea level rise, changes in the geographic range, and seasonality of disease-transmitting vectors), threaten nature benefits for health (e.g., provisioning services such as agriculture, range/pasturing, forestry, and mining [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) that rural communities rely on for their economic stability, as well as social-ecological connections vital to health and well-being [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indirect health impacts, e.g., through contaminated water and food supplies [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and more direct physical (e.g., injury) and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression) impacts [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], have the potential to overwhelm the limited healthcare and public health capabilities of more remote areas [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
