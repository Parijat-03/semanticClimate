By 2050, climate scientists project that about 150 million people globally could be exposed to chronic flooding from human-induced sea level rise (IPCC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>; Kulp &amp; Strauss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). In response, city governments in urban centers are experimenting with large scale flood infrastructure as a way of adapting in place (Oppenheimer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>), as well as contemplating the controversial possibility of retreating away from rising seas (Hino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>; Koslov, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>; Siders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>). Scholars and policymakers alike have emphasized the importance of public participation in infrastructure plans, noting the desirability of including residents and other civil society actors to legitimize and bolster the procedural justice dimensions of government initiatives (Anguelovski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Oppenheimer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>; Shi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2016</xref>). Yet a challenge for sociologists in the coming decades will be to understand the possible roles for residents, community groups, and the state in collectively preparing for our warmer, wetter future: How, and to what extent, should large-scale climate policy be guided by democratic principles, and to what it extent should it be guided by technical experts with specialized knowledge such as climate scientists or engineers?</p>
