To date, climate policy has been largely designed within the context of &#8220;climate isolationism,&#8221; which refers to the common framing of climate change as a narrow, isolated, discrete, scientific problem that requires a technological solution (Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2020</xref>). Decision-makers working through a climate isolationism lens often focus in a technocratic way on achieving carbon reductions while inadvertently dismissing the social justice implications and human dimensions of these measures (Stephens Forthcoming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2021</xref>). Controversy surrounding California&#8217;s cap-and-trade program illustrates the conflict between climate justice and mainstream, technocratic policies (Basseches et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>).</p>
