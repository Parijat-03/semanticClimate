That is, social media is largely only possible because of its reliance on large database systems that afford horizontal visibility within peer groups. Thus, it is unsurprising that social media has been politically useful in the processes of political mobilisation. As evidenced in the work of groups like GetUp! (an Australian-based independent movement for progressive participation in democratic processes), along with others, groups have successfully capitalised off of internet-based technologies to disseminate their message and motivate collective action (Vromen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>). Equally, Xenos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>) have argued strongly for a positive relationship between young people&#8217;s time spent on social media and political participation. Based on a survey of young people (16&#8211;29) in the USA, UK and Australia, and drawn from online panels, they argued that social media was positively related to increase political participation and produce a good regression analysis in support of this claim.</p>
