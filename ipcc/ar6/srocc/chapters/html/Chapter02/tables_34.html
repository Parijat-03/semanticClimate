      <td>The Cordillera Blanca of Peru contains most of the glaciers in the tropics, and its glacier coverage declined significantly in the recent\npast (Burns and Nolin, 2014; Mark et al., 2017). Since the 1940s, glacier hazards have killed thousands (Carey, 2005) and remain\nthreatening. Glacier wastage has also reduced river runoff in most of its basins in recent decades, particularly in the dry season (Baraer\net al., 2012; Vuille et al., 2018). Residents living adjacent to the Cordillera Blanca have long recognised this glacier shrinkage, including\nrural populations living near glaciers and urban residents worried about glacier lake floods and glacier landslides (Jurt et al., 2015;\nWalter, 2017). Glacier hazards and the glacier runoff variability increase exposure and uncertainty while diminishing adaptive capacity\n(Rasmussen, 2016).</td>

      <td>Cordillera Blanca residents&#8217; risk of glacier-related disasters is amplified by intersecting physical and societal factors. Cryosphere hazards\ninclude expanding or newly forming glacial lakes, slope instability, and other consequences of rising temperatures, and precipitation\nchanges (Emmer et al., 2016; Colonia et al., 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017). Human vulnerability to these hazards is conditioned by\nfactors such as poverty, limited political influence and resources, minimal access to education and healthcare, and weak government\ninstitutions (Hegglin and Huggel, 2008; Carey et al., 2012; Lynch, 2012; Carey et al., 2014; Heikkinen, 2017). Early warning systems\nhave been, or are being, installed at glacial lakes Laguna 513 and Palcacocha to protect populations (Mu&#241;oz et al., 2016). Laguna\n513 was lowered by 20 m for outburst prevention in the early 1990s but nonetheless caused a destructive flood in 2010, though\nmuch smaller and less destructive than a flood that would have been expected without previous lake mitigation works (Carey et al.,\n2012; Schneider et al., 2014). An early warning system was subsequently installed, but some local residents destroyed it in 2017\ndue to political, social and cultural conflicts (Fraser, 2017). The nearby Lake Palcacocha also threatens populations (Wegner, 2014;\nSomos-Valenzuela et al., 2016). The usefulness for ground-level education and communication regarding advanced early warning\nsystems has been demonstrated in Peru (Mu&#241;oz et al., 2016).</td>

      <td>Vulnerability to hydrologic variability and declining glacier runoff is also shaped by intertwining human and biophysical drivers playing\nout in dynamic hydro-social systems (Bury et al., 2013; Rasmussen 2016; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Carey et al., 2017). Water security is\ninfluenced by both water availability (supply from glaciers) as well as by water distribution, which is affected by factors such as water\nlaws and policies, global demand for agricultural products grown in the lower Santa River basin, energy demands and hydroelectricity\nproduction, potable water usage, and livelihood transformations over time (Carey et al., 2014; Vuille et al., 2018). In some cases, the\nformation of new glacial lakes can create opportunities as well as hazards, such as new tourist attractions and reservoirs of water,\nthereby showing how socioeconomic and geophysical forces intersect in complex ways (Colonia et al., 2017).</td>
