<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0495">Natural capital needs to be accounted for in decision-making processes. The pandemic has further underlined that our food and economic systems at large are embedded in the natural system. National wealth accounts, which include natural capital alongside human and physical capital, can help build a more comprehensive assessment of economic and environmental sustainability. The World Bank, United Nations, and other organizations have led pioneering efforts to strengthen accounting approaches (e.g., <xref rid="bb0690" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">UNU-IHP and UNEP, 2012</xref>). There is an urgent need to expand such efforts and bringing them into decision-making contexts. This will not only improve the scope and measurement of natural capital, but also requires that the limits to the substitutability of natural capital are recognized (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Hepburn et al., 2017</xref>), considering that some natural capital is complementary to other forms of capital and essential to the sustainable provisioning of ecosystem goods and services. While it is difficult to determine what the critical level of natural capital is, the SDGs and other environmental targets can offer some initial guidance on how much natural capital should be deemed essential, based on collective value judgments (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Hepburn et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
