<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par47">Feinstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>) states that &#8220;the science&#8221; of science museums is often developed &#8220;with a particular group of people in mind&#8221; (p. 534). This is powerful and dangerous. Although science museums are viewed worldwide as places for learning science, research and practices tell us that, typically, the way we create these learning experiences is based on a set of norms, conventions, and practices of particular groups of people (Dawson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014b</xref>; Feinstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). It can be more difficult and less rewarding for visitors engaging in cultural practices that are unfamiliar to them, or which contradict their own practices (Rogoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2003</xref>). According to Sj&#246;str&#246;m and Eilks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2017</xref>), the views we develop on scientific knowledge depend on (and are embedded in) our own culture (including values and worldviews). If we adhere to the notion of science museums as epistemological spaces, we can (and should) consider a range of science learning experiences that honour a diversity of perspectives and knowledge systems and that engage the learner in the co-production of knowledge.</p>
