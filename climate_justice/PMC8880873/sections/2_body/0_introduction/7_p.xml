This is surprising because RPS (even after accounting for their varying stringency) create the demand for renewable energy that tribal nations are in the position to satisfy [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. What then hampers their ability to convert renewable energy demand and technical wind potential into installed capacity. We suggest the important role of administrative capacity and business experience. This is probably why we find a statistically significant association between casino footage and wind capacity. Casinos (which are owned by tribal governments) provide tribes with experience of dealing with non-tribal business partners and navigating administrative complexities. Akee et al.
