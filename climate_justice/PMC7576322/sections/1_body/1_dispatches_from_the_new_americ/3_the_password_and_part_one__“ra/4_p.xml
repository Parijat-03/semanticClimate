<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0050">The dispatches (written similarly to features you would find in <italic>The New York Times Magazine</italic> or <italic>The Atlantic</italic>) in this section focus on how life in Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, and Miami Beach, Florida have been altered for the citizens that remain in these communities and the science behind the rotting of the Sprague River Marsh. The dispatches serve to inform the reader of the harm brought to communities in climate sensitive regions, and how this further shapes the lives of citizens who remain behind. In Isle de Jean Charles, Rush recounts a conversation with a resident (Chris Brunet) about signs of environmental changes (in this case, the two of them witnessing a dolphin swimming in water that had previously been freshwater), and while for her this was a clear sign of environmental changes, for Chris &#8220;the worst destruction is taking place in our communities&#8221; (p. 25). The destruction within the community of Isle de Jean Charles are a result of how citizens have left, searching for better economic opportunity, and less vulnerability to the increasing destruction of storms.</p>
