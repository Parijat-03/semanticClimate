<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par16">To note, the desire for a curriculum like ours arose not because we wanted to discourage or diminish the existence of CCE curriculum already blended implicitly within several existing structures in schools of education (Denby and Rickards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Molthan-Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>), but to draw out an explicit curricular experience of CCE and model a new multi-lateral approach among students at schools of education. Too often, when students engage in classes in which elements of sustainable development (SD) are implicit within the content or pedagogy of the class (Denby and Rickards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>), key competencies in sustainable development (SD) are passed down in an &#8216;unconscious&#8217; or &#8216;unofficial&#8217; way, making the transition from knowledge into action difficult (Lambrechts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>).</p>
