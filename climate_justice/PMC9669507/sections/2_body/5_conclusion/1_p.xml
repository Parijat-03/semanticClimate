<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Predictive journalism offers the public the ability to explore possible future
scenarios on topics that are relevant to society and help them comprehend
uncertainties about the future. In this research, online news comments enabled us to
understand audiences&#8217; responses to COVID models in the news and more broadly to the
emerging genre of predictive journalism. Specifically, this research is a step
toward examining how this genre of journalism impacts the public&#8217;s emotions,
behaviors, and future thinking. We elaborate a discussion examining the role of
affect in future-oriented cognition around media, the notion of collective
responsibility assignment which may have implications for how groups plan the future
or think about accountability for failure, and the idea of leveraging comment
responses for improving communication of predictions. Based on our findings, we
propose future research directions around deepening our understanding of the role of
predictive journalism in shaping public opinion especially with respect to future
decisions on policies for a variety of social and political issues. In particular,
survey methods could also be developed to further understand audience responses to
predictive journalism, especially given that not all articles have comments. The
typology presented in this work opens up space for future research to validate it,
operationalize it for quantitative study, and extend it to study it in other
exceeding important domains such as election and climate forecasting.</p>
