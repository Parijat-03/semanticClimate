Urban food consumption is a large source of these anthropogenic GHG emissions (Goldstein et&#160;al. 2017). In developed countries, per capita emissions are larger in small cities than bigger ones, while the opposite is&#160;found in developing countries (Gudipudi et&#160;al. 2019).

It has been identi&#64257;ed as a major driver of land degradation, as illustrated in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Highly productive lands are experiencing the highest rate of conversion to urbanised landscapes (Nizeyimana et&#160;al. 2001; Pandey et&#160;al.&#160;2018), affecting food security. Loss of agricultural land and increased pollution and waste are some of key challenges arising from urbanisation and urban growth (Chen 2007). The proportion of urban population is predicted to reach about 70% by the middle of the century (United Nations 2017) with growth especially taking place in the developing world (Angel et&#160;al. 2011; Dahiya 2012). Urban sprawl is projected to consume 1.8&#8211;2.4% and 5% of the current cultivated land by 2030 and 2050, respectively (Pradhan et&#160;al. 2014; Bren d&#8217;Amour et&#160;al. 2016), driven by both general population increase and immigration from rural areas (Adger et&#160;al. 2015; Seto et&#160;al. 2011; Geddes et&#160;al. 2012). New city dwellers in developing countries will require land for housing to be converted from non-urban to urban land (Barbero-Sierra et&#160;al. 2013), indicating future degradation. These growing urban areas will experience direct and indirect climate change impacts, such as sea level rise and storm surges (Boettle et&#160;al. 2016; Revi et&#160;al. 2014), increasing soil salinity and landslides from precipitation extremes. Furthermore, poorly planned urbanisation can increase people&#8217;s risk to climate hazards as informal settlements and poorly built infrastructure are often the most exposed to hazards from &#64257;re, &#64258;ooding and landslides (Adger et&#160;al. 2015; Geddes et&#160;al. 2012; Revi et&#160;al. 2014). Currently, avoiding land degradation and maintaining/enhancing ecosystem services are rarely considered in planning processes (Kuang et&#160;al. 2017). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="390.83" top="171.42"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.26; y0: 171.42; y1: 181.42; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="171.42" x1="390.83">Climate change, urban heat island and threats speci&#64257;c to urban populations</span><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.8; y0: 159.52; y1: 169.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="159.52" x1="551.85">Cities alter the local atmospheric conditions as well as those of the surrounding areas (Wang et&#160;al. 2016b; Zhong et&#160;al. 2017).
