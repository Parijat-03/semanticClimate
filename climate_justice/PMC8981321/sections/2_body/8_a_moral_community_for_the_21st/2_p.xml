Much as climate justice aims to reveal the unequal spread of the climate crisis across populations, medical justice acknowledges the complicated world beyond the walls of our clinics. A social lens teaches us that health cannot be separated from wider social, economic and political factors. If our social and economic system is harming our patients, we have a responsibility to diagnose and treat that problem too.</p>
