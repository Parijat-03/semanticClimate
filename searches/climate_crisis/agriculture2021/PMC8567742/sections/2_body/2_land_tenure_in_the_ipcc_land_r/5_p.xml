Furthermore: &#8216;around 521 million ha of forest land is estimated to be legally owned, recognised, or designated for use by indigenous and local communities as of 2017&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;In 2005 only 1% of land in Africa was legally registered&#8217; (IPCC, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, p. 749). It goes on:
<disp-quote specific-use="block"><p>Much of the world&#8217;s carbon is stored in the biomass and soil on the territories of customary landowners, including indigenous people&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;making securing of these land tenure regimes vital in land and climate protection. These lands are estimated to hold at least 293 GtC of carbon, of which around one-third (72 GtC) is located in areas where indigenous peoples and local communities lack formal recognition of their tenure rights.
