<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Overall, our statistical findings provide substantial evidence to suggest that exposure to heat in Delhi is shaped by demographic vulnerability in terms of the proportions of children and households with 9 or more members, economic vulnerability in terms of lack of access to assets and electricity, and employment vulnerability related to agricultural work. Greenspace as measured by the NDVI is also related to economic factors, specifically households with assets and electricity. These findings collectively suggest that climate change vulnerability in Delhi will be defined by a combination of presence of children, household socioeconomic status, as well as dependence on agricultural occupations. In terms of the latter, Delhi&#8217;s constant growth into surrounding rural areas, and strong agricultural traditions due to location in India&#8217;s northern Green Revolution belt, shapes vulnerability to heat in terms of both economic characteristics and social identities.</p>
