In regions where large\nice sheets, such as the Fennoscandian in Eurasia and the Laurentide and Cordilleran in North America, covered\nthe land during the last ice age, the land is still slowly rising up now that the extra weight of the ice sheets is\ngone. This local recovery is compensating for global sea level rise in these regions and can even lead to local\ndecrease in sea level. In regions just beyond where the former ice sheets reached and the Earth bulged upwards,\nthe land is now falling and, as a result, local sea level rise is faster than the global rate. In many regions within\nlow-lying delta regions (such as New Orleans and the Ganges&#8211;Brahmaputra delta), the land is rapidly subsiding\n(sinking) because of human activities such as building dams or groundwater and fossil fuel extraction. Further,\nwhen an ice sheet melts, it has less gravitational pull on the ocean water nearby. This reduction in gravitational\nattraction causes sea level to fall close to the (now less-massive) ice sheet while causing sea level to rise farther\naway. Melt from a polar ice sheet therefore raises sea level most in the opposite hemisphere or in low latitudes &#8211;\namounting to tens of centimetres difference in rise between regions by 2100.</td>
