As Antadze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>) noted, a new reality in the age of the Anthropocene requires us to rethink the nature of <italic>togetherness</italic> as an openness to the other who is unknown but may suffer the unfair consequences of our own actions. The totality of climate change and global pandemic means that we have to take responsibility for the suffering of the other and develop an imaginative capacity through empathy to emotionally engage with the other. Empathy is sharing of another&#8217;s emotional state or putting oneself in someone&#8217;s shoes. However, sustainability science so far appears to turn away from empathising with the people&#8217;s sufferings in real life. Now is a time of reckoning. Scientists should hold up mirrors which reveal the contradictions and limitations of and within science, including systemic racism in science (Nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>; Thorp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>). By doing so, sustainability research should have a new normative commitment to building collective empathy for the vulnerable other.</p>
