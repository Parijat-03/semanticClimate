The scheduled age and gender proportions were based on the <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Federal Statistical Office Germany (2019)</xref>. Three panelists responded that they were 16 or 17 years old. We initially planned to only include data from participants that were at least 18 years old as these were requested from the panel provider. However, we decided to retain the data from these participants for the analyses as their participation is in accordance with the German legislation and we did not expect their response pattern to differ substantially from the participants that were at least 18 years old. The gender distribution in Germany is nearly equal (50.7% female, 49.3% male; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Federal Statistical Office Germany, 2019</xref>) and therefore was assumed to be 50:50. Due to an unknown distribution of individuals who identify themselves as non-binary, these were not included (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
