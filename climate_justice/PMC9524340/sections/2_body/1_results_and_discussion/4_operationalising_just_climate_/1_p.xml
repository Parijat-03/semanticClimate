This finding is important, as scholars and practitioners involved in both climate adaptation and mitigation have repeatedly called out the lack of concrete tools and metrics to operationalise just climate policies on the ground<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

Cities may use these instruments at one or more stages of the policymaking process, and they often involve the engagement of multiple community actors (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Policy tools and strategies to develop just climate policies.</title><p><italic>Equity tools</italic> and <italic>equity advisory boards</italic> can be implemented throughout the policy process. <italic>Justice partnerships</italic> are mainly focused on policy design and implementation. <italic>Justice indicators</italic> are used during policy evaluation.
