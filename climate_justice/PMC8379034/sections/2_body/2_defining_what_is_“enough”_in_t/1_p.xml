What level of consumption can the earth support? Many of these questions cannot be answered definitively, but &#8230; unless we see that more is not always better, our efforts to forestall ecological decline will be overwhelmed by our appetites&#8221; (Durning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1992</xref>). This issue and question of &#8220;how much is enough&#8221; represents a good conceptual frame to highlight the past, current, and future gap in terms of climate change investment and finance. More than any other issue, the failure to deliver on the promise of a secure and stable funding can only be described as the &#8220;original sin&#8221; of global climate change/sustainability governance. This is why climate change investment and finance-related issues serve as such important criteria to assess whether or not the USA and other wealthier OECD countries have lived up to their historical responsibilities under the UNFCCC Principle of Common, But Differentiated Responsibilities (Zhang and Pan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>).</p>
