Deserti&#64257;cation in China was found to have resulted in substantial losses in income, food production and jobs (Jiang et al. 2014). On the other hand, Ge et al. (2015) indicated that deserti&#64257;cation was positively associated with growing incomes in Inner Mongolia in China in the short run since no costs were incurred for SLM, while in the long run higher incomes allowed allocation of more investments to reduce deserti&#64257;cation. This relationship corresponds to the Environmental Kuznets Curve, which posits that environmental degradation initially rises and subsequently falls with rising income (e.g.,&#160;Stern 2017).

Nkonya et al. (2016a) estimated that cultivating wheat, maize, and rice with unsustainable land management practices is currently resulting in global losses of 56.6&#160;billion USD annually, with another&#160;8.7&#160;billion&#160;USD of annual losses due to lower livestock productivity caused by rangeland degradation. However, the extent to which these losses affected food insecurity in dryland areas is not known. Lower crop yields and higher agricultural prices worsen existing food insecurity, especially for net food-buying rural households and urban dwellers. Climate change and deserti&#64257;cation are not the sole drivers of food insecurity, but especially in the areas with high dependence on agriculture, they are among the main&#160;contributors. </span></div><div left="81.84" right="214.08" top="726.71"><span style="x0: 81.84; x1: 85.34; y0: 726.71; y1: 735.33; width: 3.51; font-size: 8.62; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ACCPHD+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="81.84" y0="726.71" x1="214.08">LowMediumHigh LowHigh Length stands for the magnitude of impactShades show level of con&#64257;dence</span></div></body></html>
