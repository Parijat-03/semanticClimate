To date, more than 79 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and nearly half of those infected have died from AIDS-related illnesses.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In recent decades, sub-Saharan Africa has become the epicenter of the epidemic, accounting for 39% of all new infections.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Both HIV and climate change disproportionately affect globally underdeveloped regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Climate change may be linked to HIV acquisition and onward transmission risk through complex pathways, including greater migration, higher infectious disease prevalence, access to HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy, infrastructure erosion, and food insecurity.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For example, food insecurity linked to extreme weather events may be associated with high-risk for sexual activity that puts people&#8212;disproportionately women&#8212;at higher risk of contracting HIV. Many studies from sub-Saharan Africa and other regions have reported an association between food insufficiency and inconsistent condom use with nonprimary partners, sex exchange, intergenerational sexual relationships, and a lack of control of sexual relationships.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220857r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, human migration from extreme weather events can enlarge sexual networks, amplifying the risk for HIV.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
