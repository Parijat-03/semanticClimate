The regulation creates a framework for listing officially sanctioned &#8216;sustainable&#8217; investments and for combating greenwashing. It lists environmental objectives including, <italic>inter alia</italic>, climate mitigation and adaptation (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>, art. 9). The environmental sustainability of an investment is assessed based on how it contributes to specific environmental objectives and whether it causes significant harm to <italic>any</italic> of the environmental objectives (Ibid, art. 3). Transparency requirements are created for various kinds of financial products and investments (Ibid, art. 5&#8211;8). The details (or &#8216;technical screening criteria&#8217;: Ibid, art. 19) for whether any specific economic activity contributes to environmental objectives are determined in delegated acts to be adopted by the Commission (Ibid, art. 23). On this, the Commission is being advised by a Platform on Sustainable Finance comprising key agencies and stakeholder groups (Ibid, art. 20). The first delegated act, with technical screening criteria regarding climate mitigation and adaptation, was adopted in June 2021.</p>
