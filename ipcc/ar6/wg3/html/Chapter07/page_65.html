Figure&#160;7.17 shows Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) for achieving different climate targets highlighting AFOLU mitigation strategies, resulting GHG and land-use dynamics as well as the interaction with other sectors. For consistency this chapter discusses IMPs as described in detail in chapters&#160;1 and 3 of this report but focusing on the land-use sector. All pathways are assessed by different IAM realisations and do not only reduce GHG emissions but also use CDR options, whereas </span></div></body></html>
