<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par38">Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, b, and c</xref> shows the diagnostic plots of the remaining three candidate models: AMS (GEV, MLE), POT (GPA, MLE), and the AMS (GEV, Bayesian). A visual assessment of the QQ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, upper left panels), density (lower left panels), and return level plots (lower right panels) show a better performance from AMS (GEV; MLE and Bayesian) as compared with POT (GPA, MLE). Furthermore, the density and the fitted against empirical quantile plots suggest a better fit by AMS (GEV, MLE) than AMS (GEV, Bayesian). In addition, the normal AMS (GEV, MLE) model was more acceptable than a similar type with a log link function to the scale parameter (<italic>&#963;</italic>(&#8709;&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;<italic>log&#160;&#963;</italic>)), according to the LR test where <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05. From the foregoing, the AMS (GEV, MLE) was selected for the analysis of floods both under stationary and non-stationary conditions. The modeled T-year lake levels of the AMS (GEV, MLE) with parameters (<italic>&#956;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;475.28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.24, <italic>&#963;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.74&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.16, and <italic>&#958;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;0.29&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2) are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. The results in Table 7 suggest that more frequent T = 2-year lake levels of 475.41&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.21 m ASVD, and the lake levels may reach 477.13&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5 m ASVD once in every T = 100 years. The T = 100 year level is comparable with the lake level peak of May 1980, suggesting a 100-year cycle in the lake levels of this magnitude. However, the extremely low lake levels between 1915 and 1935 (about 469 m ASVD) were not captured by the models, suggesting that they are a very rare event. The stationary model with the GEV is henceforth referred to as AMS<sub>0</sub>.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Diagnostic plots for (<bold>a</bold>) AMS (GEV, MLE); (<bold>b</bold>) POT (GPA, MLE); and (<bold>c</bold>) AMS (GEV, Bayesian)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Return levels for AMS with GEV and MLE</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">T-Year</th><th colspan="2">Level ( 95% CI)</th></tr><tr><th>AMS</th><th>POT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-year</td><td>475.41 (475.20, 475.61)</td><td>477.11 (475.97, 478.25)</td></tr><tr><td>5-year</td><td>476.03 (475.80, 476.27)</td><td>477.18 (475.41, 478.94)</td></tr><tr><td>10-year</td><td>476.37 (476.11, 476.63)</td><td>477.21 (474.75, 479.67)</td></tr><tr><td>20-year</td><td>476.65 (476.33, 476.96)</td><td>477.24 (473.80, 480.67)</td></tr><tr><td>50-year</td><td>476.95 (476.54, 477.35)</td><td>477.26 (471.92, 482.60)</td></tr><tr><td>100-year</td><td>477.13 (476.63, 477.63)</td><td>477.27 (469.82, 484.73)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
