The resulting socioecological crises have disproportionately benefited and harmed different countries and regions of the world and different segments of society (genders, ethnicities, races) (Gore and Alestig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>; Harcourt and Nelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>; Hickel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">b</xref>; Hickel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>; Sultana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2021</xref>). Those least responsible for the crises are, however, the most vulnerable and unprotected, importantly as a result of the continued marginalization and dispossession enabled by colonialism and the coloniality that followed it.</p>
