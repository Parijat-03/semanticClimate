It is a central element because many of the plans and decisions that are taken to promote projects in the territories do not always apply the right to consultation with our Peoples. This is important to highlight since Convention 169 is practically signed by all the countries of the Latin American region. It is therefore necessary to implement this legal instrument, which is now the law in all countries.</p>
