<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">But we've also realized that our collection has this hidden potential as a biorepository of historical infectious diseases and historical medical conditions. In the past twenty years, we've been able to access ancient <sc>Dna</sc> (a<sc>Dna</sc>) through technology. We've also recently discovered that paper archives are also biorepositories. We're trying to get a<sc>Dna</sc> from the letter writers who licked envelopes in 1918 and 1919. I've been reaching out to archives and finding out that not everybody saves the envelopes. They save only the letter. People have come to us wanting to donate letters from their family members from 1918 in which they're saying in the letter, &#8220;I had the flu and I'm better now&#8221; or &#8220;I'm still not feeling very well.&#8221; And if we have those envelopes, stamped by date, in these paper archives, we can test the envelope glue strip to see if the person had active influenza or had antibodies. Many of us never thought that such items would have biological and genetic information that could be used to save lives&#8212;of people living now.</p>
