In moments of crisis, people tend to focus on the daily emergencies of surviving that crisis, whatever it is, and tend to put too much trust in those in power&#8217; (Solis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>). While billions of people are unaware of WEF capture of the UN and remain subject to the discourse of a <italic>single</italic> global food system, there is nevertheless a global resistance fundamentally mistrusting corporate &#8216;techno-productivism&#8217; at the expense of human rights to (produce) food and advocating democratic territorial food systems. Arguably, this mobilizing vision has potential since the current elite response to &#8216;disaster capitalism&#8217; in promoting corporate capture of food system governance can only magnify the &#8216;disaster&#8217;, as soils, biodiversity and atmospheric health deteriorate and rural population redundancy rises.</p>
