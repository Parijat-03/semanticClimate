The SR15 de&#64257;nition further speci&#64257;es: &#8220;In the context of the assessment of climate impacts, the term risk is often used to refer to the potential for adverse consequences of a climate-related hazard, or of adaptation or mitigation responses to such a hazard, on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and infrastructure.&#8221; In SR15, as in the IPCC SREX and AR5 WGII, risk is conceptualised as resulting from the interaction of vulnerability (of the affected system), its exposure over time (to a hazard), as well as the (climate-related) impact and the likelihood of its occurrence (AR5 2014; IPCC 2018a, 2012). In&#160;the context of SRCCL, risk must also be seen as including risks to the implementation of responses to land&#8211;climate challenges from economic, political and governance factors. Climate and land risks must be seen in relation to human values and objectives (Denton et al. 2014). Risk is closely associated with concepts of vulnerability and resilience, which are themselves subject to differing de&#64257;nitions across different knowledge communities. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="147.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 147.56; y1: 157.06; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="147.56" x1="313.21">Risks examined in this chapter arise from more than one of the major land&#8211;climate&#8211;society challenges (deserti&#64257;cation, land degradation, and food insecurity), or partly stem from mitigation or adaptation actions, or cascade across different sectors or geographical locations.
