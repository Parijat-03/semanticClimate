<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It's very important that we're not extractive. Designing my project the way I did, with one hundred undergraduate students who are fairly representative of the regions of Puerto Rico, means that I'm not necessarily the front person who's going into a community. I'm training a student as part of their educational experience to go into their home community with a different set of eyes, a respectful and ethical set of eyes, but one that says, &#8220;where are the stories and where are the parts of the stories that need to be recorded, and how can I facilitate recording that?&#8221; It's important for people to hear these stories, and it's good for the speakers to know that they're listened to, because we want to enact policy change and because we're in a climate emergency. And the lessons learned from these stories are imperative for people all around the world.</p>
