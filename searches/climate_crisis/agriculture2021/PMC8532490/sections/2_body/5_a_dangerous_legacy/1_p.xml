As an international inter-governmental body, the CFS is subject to the same forces of economic and financial globalization, neoliberal trade and investment, and political authoritarianism that are reshaping multilateralism. The challenges of multi-stakeholderism in international policymaking were starkly visible in the negotiations on the CFS <italic>Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems</italic> (RAI) in 2014. Language on the right to food, importance of small-scale producers, respect for decent work and worker&#8217;s rights, elimination of discrimination against women, governance and accountability were consistently undermined by&#160;language emphasizing free trade and investment agreements and rules. Even the universally recognized rights of indigenous peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent were compromised.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref></p>
