<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate change, with its continuous increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is now disrupting lives everywhere [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite their nominal contribution to GHG emissions, the least developed countries are the most vulnerable to its consequences [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It raises concerns related to climate justice and climate governance [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To tackle the issue, the United Nations (UN) under Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)&#8212;Climate Action&#8212;175 countries initially signed the PA after the 21st conference of parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015 [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Today, 193 countries&#8212;almost all countries on earth&#8212;have joined the PA. Articles 2 and 3 of the PA require all party countries to &#8220;undertake and communicate&#8221; (p. 3) their NDCs in order &#8220;to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels&#8221; (p. 3).</p>
