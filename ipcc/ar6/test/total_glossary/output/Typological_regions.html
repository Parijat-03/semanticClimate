<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0"></p>
<p>Regions of the Earth that share one or more specific features (known as âtypologiesâ), such as geographic location (e.g., coastal), physical processes (e.g., <em>monsoons</em>), and biological (e.g., coral reefs, tropical <em>forests</em>), geological (e.g., mountains) or <em>anthropogenic</em> (e.g., megacities) formation, and for which it is useful to consider the common <em>climate</em> features. Typological regions are smaller than climatic zones (e.g., a mountain region) and can be discontinuous (e.g., a group of megacities affected by the <em>urban heat island</em> effect, or monsoon regions).</p>
