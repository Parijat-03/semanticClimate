Together, the most fundamental lesson of economics&#8212;internalization of emissions externalities&#8212;must be applied. So, as Kaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017a</xref>), a shift away from the lock-in to conventional theorizing of GPGs is warranted, toward a public economics that truly represents the global policy concerns like climate change.</p>
