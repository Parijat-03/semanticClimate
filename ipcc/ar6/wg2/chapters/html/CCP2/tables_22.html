First, they are critical nodes of global trade, economic activity and coast-dependent livelihoods, all of which are highly and increasingly\nexposed to climate- and ocean-driven hazards (FAQ CCP2.1). Second, coastal C&amp;S are also sites where some of the most pressing development\nchallenges are at play (e.g., trade-offs between expanding critical built infrastructure while protecting coastal ecosystems, high economic\ngrowth coupled with high inequality in some coastal megacities). Third, coastal C&amp;S are also centres of innovation and creativity, thus presenting\na tremendous opportunity for climate action through a range of infrastructural, nature-based, institutional and behavioural solutions (FAQ\nCCP2.2). Given these three realities of high climate change risks, rapid but contested and unequal development trajectories, and high potential</td>

Another key enabler is acknowledging the sociocultural and\npsychological barriers to climate action and incentivising people to change to lifestyles and behaviours that are\npro-climate and aligned with community-oriented values and norms. In practice, coastal C&amp;S are experimenting\nwith different strategies to change practices and behaviours, such as using subsidies and zoning policies, tax rebates\nand public awareness campaigns to promote individual and collective action. Finally, enabling CRD needs dedicated\nshort- and long-term financing to reorient current trajectories of unsustainable and unequal development towards\nclimate mitigation and adaptation action that reduces current and predicted losses and damages, especially in\nhighly vulnerable coasts such as the small island states, the Arctic and low-lying C&amp;S. Currently, adaptation finance\nis concentrated in coastal megacities and tends to be deployed for risk-proofing high-value waterfront properties\nor key infrastructures.
