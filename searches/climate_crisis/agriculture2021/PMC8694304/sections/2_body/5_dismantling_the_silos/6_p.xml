Environmental and animal welfare researchers are working with public health experts to advocate for a focus on prevention and preparedness, not solely improving preparedness. That&#8217;s necessary, but also insufficient, as this essay has sought to argue. Four Paws, an animal welfare organization based in Vienna, convened a group of experts in the lead-up to the 2021 World Health Assembly to review the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and how future pandemics could be prevented. The group, of which I was a member, concluded that &#8220;zoonoses are a clear symptom of the serious crisis between humans, animals, and the environment,&#8221; pointing to live animal markets, factory farming, and fur farms as leading risk spots for the emergence of future pandemics. The Four Paws-organized <italic toggle="yes">Future Study</italic> urges policy makers to take animal welfare seriously as part of pandemic prevention plans and the &#8220;paradigm shift&#8221; required post-COVID-19. While not a rights-based instrument, this concept of a global pandemic treaty links prevention and preparedness, animal welfare, environmental protections, health care systems, justice, and equity in provocative and yet eminently pragmatic ways.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>
