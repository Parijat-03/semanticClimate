We re-analyzed the Tobit and binary logistic regression models in the two previous sections to account for a moderating relationship between floodplain location and census tract-level racial composition and median income variables; results are found in the Supplementary Information in Tables&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref>. Among parcels outside of the floodplains, the econometric models show that climate change-attributed flooding is more likely in census tracts with more Latina/x/o residents. Previous findings relating to income, proportion Latina/x/o, and the moderating effect between these two variables hold in these models. In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we estimate (using descriptive statistics in a similar approach to that of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) that ~52% of all parcels outside of the floodplain flooded because of climate change are estimated to be Latina/x/o households compared to 38% inside of the floodplain.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Percent of Latina/x/o parcels flooded because of climate change inside and outside of floodplains (38% scenario).</title><p>Estimated percentages for residential properties in Harris County, Texas during Hurricane Harvey.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31056_Fig5_HTML" id="d32e1349"/></fig></p>
