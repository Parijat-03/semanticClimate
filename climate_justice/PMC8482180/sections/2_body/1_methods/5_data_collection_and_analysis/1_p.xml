Food-specific data, including food availability, access, acquisition practices, and connections to environmental conditions, are used to identify resources, programming, or policy solutions within the community. Impacts on health are also tracked by asking citizens about their mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. These time-stamped big data include both subjective ecological momentary assessments and objective sensor data [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
