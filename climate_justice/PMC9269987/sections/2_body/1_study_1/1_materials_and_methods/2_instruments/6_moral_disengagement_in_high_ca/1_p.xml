(2012)</xref> on moral disengagement in general, we developed a German questionnaire that measures an individual&#8217;s propensity to morally disengage in the context of high carbon behavior (MD-HCB; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Stoll-Kleemann et al., 2022b</xref>). The MD-HCB covers nine mechanisms of moral disengagement following <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz and Shariff (2012)</xref> and <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bandura (2016)</xref> with two questions each (18 items in total). An exemplary item is &#8220;In terms of my carbon emissions, I don&#8217;t want to give much consideration to people who live very far away and whom I will never meet.&#8221; The reliability was excellent, with Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.96, and the measure was found to be valid in terms of factorial, criterion, convergent, and discriminant validity (see <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Stoll-Kleemann et al., 2022b</xref>).</p>
