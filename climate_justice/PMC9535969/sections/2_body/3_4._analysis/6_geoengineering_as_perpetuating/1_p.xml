Climate change affects disproportionately the Global South, and disadvantaged populations, while not taking part in the carbon economy, are particularly vulnerable to its consequences. Groups I (environmentalists), II (university students) and III (activists) were particularly vocal about the potential devastating social and political impacts of geoengineering on the Global South:<disp-quote><p>In regards to North/South inequalities, one of the potential consequences of introducing aerosols into the stratosphere is a reduction of the global average precipitation. But which countries would suffer the immediate and most serious impacts on their economies and agriculture? It would be the South Asian countries, extremely poor countries .&#8196;.&#8196;. These would be the first to suffer severe consequences .&#8196;.&#8196;. (DM &#8211; Group I)</p><p>All those machines, those technologies, they&#8217;re made of lithium, right? With gases and metals obtained from the Global South. So, it&#8217;s that old question again: we&#8217;re helping the environment, but at what cost? (RC &#8211; Group II)</p><p>Probably, the application of these technologies on a global scale will have an impact on North/South relations and worsen the situation of poorer countries already subjected to policy conditionality.
