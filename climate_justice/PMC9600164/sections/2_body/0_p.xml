The younger generations in these countries will experience the greatest rise in climate related exposures, with vulnerabilities compounded by continuing protracted inequity driven by colonialism, poverty, challenges of governance and conflict, and marginalisation due to gender, ethnicity, and low income.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
