Although microcredit projects have been popularised in the last decades in South Asia, microcredit has established ancient roots in Europe (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Gatto, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Seibel, 2013</xref>). Microfinance programmes do, indeed, benefit both the Global South and the Global North (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gatto et&#160;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Spiegel, 2012</xref>).
