Another projection showed that the change in heat-related deaths is largest in Southeast Asia, which was a 12.7% increase at the end of the century under a high-emissions scenario (Gasparrini et&#160;al., 2017). As the proportion of older individuals in the population rises, the number of years lost due to disability increases more steeply (Chung et&#160;al., 2017b). In the 2080s, the number of annual temperature-related deaths is estimated to reach twice that in the 1980s in China (Li et&#160;al., 2018c). Over a 20-year period in the mid-21st century (2041&#8211;2060), the incidence of excess heat-related mortality in 51 cities in China is estimated to reach 37,800 (95% CI: 31,300&#8211;43,500) deaths per year under RCP8.5 (Bazaz et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.12" top="546.63"><span x0="306.56" y0="546.63" x1="560.12" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 308.86; y0: 546.63; y1: 556.13; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Increased concentrations of fine particulate matter and ozone influenced by extreme events such as atmospheric stagnations and heatwaves are projected to result in an additional 12,100 and 8,900 deaths per year due to fine particulate matter and ozone exposure, respectively, in China in the mid-century under RCP4.5 (Hong et&#160;al., 2019a).

Among these additional deaths, 9,300 and 200 deaths, respectively, are projected to occur in South Asia. The population at risk of malaria infection is estimated to increase by 134&#160;million by 2030 in South Asia under the medium-to-high emissions scenario, considering socioeconomic development. If no actions are taken, malaria incidence in northern China is projected to increase by 69&#8211;182% by 2050 (Song et&#160;al., 2016). Another study suggested a decrease in climate suitability for malaria in northern and eastern India, southern Myanmar, southern Thailand, the Malaysia border region, Cambodia, eastern Borneo and Indonesia by 2050 (Khormi and Kumar, 2016).
