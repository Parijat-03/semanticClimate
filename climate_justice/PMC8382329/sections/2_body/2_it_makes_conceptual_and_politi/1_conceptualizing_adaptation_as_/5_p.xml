Kaul et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>) also argue that publicness or privateness are social constructs, as matters of policy choice to evolving needs. Further, adaptation and its financing are an emerging field of public policy, where political-social dynamics matter. Central to this articulation is social constructivism and normative political theory (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>), which argue that the questions of norms, morality, and justice are not external, but very much intrinsic to interactions among states in the twenty-first century (Okereke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>).</p>
