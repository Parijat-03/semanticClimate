At present, rice production in Guinea-Bissau covers half of the population's internal needs (FAOSTAT, last accessed on 25 January 2022). Only among the Balanta (the major ethnic group of the country settled all along the coast) and some Diola (Felupe/Baiote) can one find households able to produce a surplus. Among all the ethnic groups that traditionally produced mangrove rice, plowing is performed by family labor and village workgroups. The elders guaranteed the highly skilled labor of dike construction and maintenance. At present, except in some Balanta and Diola (Felupe/Baiote) households, cashew nut production for export has been drastically reducing rice production because of its (much) lower labor input and the opportunity it provides to exchange the nuts directly with imported rice at the farm gate (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>; Temudo &amp; Cabral, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>).</p>
