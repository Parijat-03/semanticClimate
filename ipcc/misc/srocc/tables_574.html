      <td>conservation agriculture and indigenous tree regeneration has started to yield positive effects on the vegetation cover and led to the\nstabilisation of about 25% of the gullies by 2010 (Frankl et al. 2013). Since 1991, farmers have provided labour for SWC in January\nas a free service for 20 consecutive working days, followed by food for work for the remaining days of the dry season. Most of the\ndegraded landscapes have been restored, with positive impacts over the last two decades on soil fertility, water availability and\ncrop productivity. However, misuse of fertilisers, low survival of tree seedlings and lack of income from exclosures may affect the\nsustainability of these land restoration measures (Gebremeskel et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>in national parks and conservation areas (Cava et al. 2018). Extensive cattle ranching (limited mechanisation, low use of fertiliser and\nseed inputs) has led to pasture expansion, including clearing forests to secure properties rights, occurring mainly over 1950&#8211;1975\n(Martha et al. 2012). Despite observed productivity gains made over the last three decades (Martha et al. 2012), more than half of the\npasture area is degraded to some extent, and challenges remain to reverse grassland degradation while accommodating growing\ndemand and simultaneously avoiding the conversion of natural habitats (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). The largest share of production\nis on unfertilised pastures, often sown with perennial forage grasses of African origin, mainly Brachiaria spp. (Cardoso et al. 2016).\nThis initial intensification era was partly at the expense of significant uncontrolled deforestation, and average animal stocking\nrates remained well below the potential carrying capacity (Strassburg et al. 2014). Changes in land use are difficult to reverse since\npasture abandonment does not lead to the spontaneous restoration of old-growth savannah (Cava et al. 2018); moreover, pasture\nto crop conversion is frequent, supporting close to half of cropland expansion in Mato Grosso state over 2000&#8211;2013 (Cohn et al.\n2016). Pasture intensification through liming, fertilisation and controlled grazing could increase soil organic carbon and reduce net\nGHG emission intensity per unit meat product, but only at increased investment cost per unit of area (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2017).\nScenarios projecting a decoupling between deforestation and increased pasture intensification, provide the basis for a Nationally\nDetermined Contribution (NDC) of Brazil that is potentially consistent with accommodating an upward trend in livestock production\nto meet increasing demand (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). Deforestation in Brazil has declined significantly between 2004 and 2014\nin the national inventory, but recent data and analyses suggest that the decrease in deforestation and the resulting GHG emissions\nreductions have slowed down or even stopped (UNEP 2017).</td>

      <td>and approximately 158,000 km2 in the period 2000&#8211;2012 (Hansen et al. 2013), most of which was converted to agricultural lands (e.g., oil\npalm, pulpwood plantations). According to recent estimates, deforestation in Indonesia mainly concerns primary forests, including intact\nand degraded forests, thus leading to biodiversity loss and reduced carbon sequestration potentials (e.g., Margono et al. 2014). For\nexample, Graham et al. (2017) estimated that the following strategies to reduce deforestation and forest degradation may cost-effectively\nincrease carbon sequestration and reduce carbon emissions in 30 years: reforestation (3.54 GtCO ), limiting the expansion of oil palm\n2\nand timber plantations into forest (3.07 GtCO and 3.05 GtCO , respectively), reducing illegal logging (2.34 GtCO ), and halting illegal\n2 2 2\nforest loss in protected areas (1.52 GtCO ) at a total cost of 15.7 USD tC&#8211;1. The importance of forest mitigation in Indonesia is indicated\n2\nby the NDC, where between half and two-thirds of the 2030 emission target relative to a business-as-usual scenario is from reducing\ndeforestation, forest degradation, peatland drainage and fires (Grassi et al. 2017). Avoiding deforestation and reforestation could have\nmultiple co-benefits by improving biodiversity conservation and employment opportunities, while reducing illegal logging in protected\nareas. However, these options could also have adverse side effects if they deprive local communities of access to natural resources\n(Graham et al. 2017). The adoption of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification in oil palm plantations reduced deforestation\nrates by approximately 33% in the period 2001&#8211;2015 (co-benefits with mitigation), and fire rates much more than for non-certified\nplantations (Carlson et al. 2018). However, given that large-scale oil palm plantations are one of the largest drivers of deforestation\nin Indonesia, objective information on the baseline trajectory for land clearance for oil palm is needed to further assess commitments,\nregulations and transparency in plantation development (Gaveau et al. 2016). For adaptation options, the community forestry scheme\nHutan Desa (Village Forest) in Sumatra and Kalimantan helped to avoid deforestation (co-benefits with mitigation) by between 0.6 and\n0.9 ha km&#8211;2 in Sumatra and 0.6 and 0.8 ha km&#8211;2 in Kalimantan in the period 2012&#8211;2016; Santika et al. 2017), improve local livelihood\noptions, and restore degraded ecosystems (positive side effects for NCP provision) (e.g., Pohnan et al. 2015). Finally, the establishment\nof Ecosystem Restoration Concessions in Indonesia (covering more than 5,500 km2 of forests now, and 16,000 km2 allocated for the\nfuture) facilitates the planting of commercial timber species (co-benefits with mitigation), while assisting natural regeneration, preserving\nimportant habitats and species, and improving local well-being and incomes (positive side effects for Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People\nprovision), at relatively lower costs compared with timber concessions (Silalahi et al. 2017).</td>
