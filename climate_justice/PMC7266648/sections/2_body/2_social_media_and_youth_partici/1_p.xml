Affordances are important because of the way they encourage, allow, discourage and prevent particular behaviours. These can be deliberately or accidentally designed into a technology, be visible, or concealed (Livingstone and Das <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>). When thinking about the application of this concept to politics, this is frequently captured in the &#8220;cost&#8221; hypothesis: the internet reduces the costs of political participation and allows some &#8220;natural&#8221; human desire to be afforded in greater abundance (Negroponte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1995</xref>).</p>
