<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The precautionary principle has previously been connected to climate change and health research [<xref rid="B43-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and is well-suited to enable decision-making in situations of high uncertainty and high risks. The precautionary principle serves as justification for implementing adaptation before evaluation results have been shared [<xref rid="B44-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As a next step, the evaluation challenges need to be addressed. Based on the challenges of associating climate change adaptation to health outcomes, the proposed theoretical framework uses proxies of adaptation effects on social and cultural determinants of health.</p>
