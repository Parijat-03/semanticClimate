<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Rather than aiming to entirely avoid or simply recycle plastics, reusable plastic packaging systems are increasingly being looked to as a potential solution to plastic waste (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">Greenwood et&#160;al. 2021</xref>); a circular economy approach has the potential to reduce the yearly volume of plastics entering the oceans by 80% and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_094" ref-type="bibr">Woolven 2021</xref>). While reusable packaging may not be suitable for all products, there is a wide range of goods that have the potential to be provided on a large-scale refill or return basis. The &#8220;refill&#8221; option of such schemes normally involves taking one&#8217;s own reusable container to a store and filling it, or taking home a minimally-packaged product to refill one&#8217;s home container. The &#8220;return&#8221; option normally involves receiving a pre-packaged product and then returning the reusable container to the vendor or manufacturer, or having it collected. &#8220;Reuse&#8221; is sometimes also considered to include repurposing (i.e. buying a single-use product and later reusing it for a different purpose), but within our project, <italic toggle="yes">Many Happy Returns</italic>, packaging is considered to be strictly &#8220;reusable&#8221; only when it can be used more than once for the same purpose, i.e. through being refillable or returnable.</p>
