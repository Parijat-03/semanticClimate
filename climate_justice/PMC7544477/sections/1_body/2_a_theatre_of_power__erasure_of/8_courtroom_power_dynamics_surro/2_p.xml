<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0170">A critical issue looming throughout these 2018&#8211;2020 trials was the question of what truth and evidence, if any, matter in a colonial justice system of an extractivist state. To speak about a new &#8216;post-truth era&#8217; &#8211; now fashionable (almost clich&#233;) in geography &#8211; is, as one Indigenous activist told me, potentially quite misleading, given that colonization has long been served by post-truth narratives. At various moments in these &#8216;contempt&#8217; trials, the judge called the TMX construction a pipeline &#8220;enhancement&#8221; rather than &#8220;expansion&#8221; &#8211; distorting truth through manipulating language. Yet, certain truths were also being indelibly <italic>felt,</italic> even if words could dance around them. On August 20th, 2018, those who came to the courthouse had to travel through thick smoke from forest fires that engulfed Vancouver &#8211; an increasing impact of climate disaster; air quality in the city reached unprecedented danger levels. Some choking in the court corridor wondered if Trudeau would finally meaningfully <italic>feel</italic> fossil fuels as creating <italic>imminent peril</italic> when he comes to BC where he was scheduled to soon visit. The juxtaposition of what was transpiring outside and inside the courthouse added to the already-existing sense of absurdity in the hearings.</p>
