Furthermore, the precipitation observing network is spatially inadequate and temporally 2 inconsistent over some regions of North America, so that detection of multidecadal trends is difficult, 3 especially for regions with summertime convective precipitation maxima that may be spatially patchy 4 (Easterling et al., 2017) (Chapter 12).  5 6 These differences in observed climate change between temperature and precipitation affect the nature of 7 hazards associated with these variables. Although Figure Atlas.42: emphasizes continental temperature 8 change, the upward trend in temperature is also observed over near-coastal oceans resulting in transient heat 9 waves (</span><span style="x0: 90.54; x1: 95.41; y0: 658.97; y1: 669.95; width: 4.87; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="90.54" y0="658.97" x1="182.23">very high confidence</span><span x0="182.22" y0="658.97" x1="41.44" style="x0: 182.22; x1: 185.27; y0: 658.97; y1: 669.95; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">; Chapter 9, WG II Chapter 14). Increasing temperature is also associated with 10 sea-level rise and associated flooding hazards which have seen significant increases during the past several 11 decades (Chapters 9 and 12).  12 13 Temperature-related hazards are particularly extreme in high latitudes: sea ice and permafrost are melting 14 rapidly, presenting coastal hazards associated with increasing storminess and diminished coastal protection 15 by ice. In forested regions of North America, probability of wildfire is increasing due to warmer temperature 16 and increased dryness of vegetation (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Increased temperature is associated 17 with increasing severity of episodic, naturally occurring drought, increasing risks to water supplies and 18 ecosystem health, and exacerbating wildfire risk (Chapter 11).  19 20 Snowfall and snow cover concern a large portion of North America (Estilow et al., 2015) and have high 21 societal and environmental impacts (Fyfe et al., 2017). Snow interacts in a complex way with temperature 22 and total precipitation, and with other variables like cloud cover and humidity as well (Mioduszewski et al., 23 2014a). Snow-related reference datasets are ultimately based on in situ and/or satellite measurements (Larue 24 et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2018), which include large uncertainties due to a certain number of technical 25 challenges (Mudryk et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), and these may in turn impact long-term trends found in 26 snow datasets (Kunkel et al., 2007). 27 28 Observations suggest a rather complex evolution of the snow cover over the continent during recent decades. 29 For example, large spatial heterogeneity was found in the trend sign and amplitude of snow water equivalent 30 (SWE) in situ local records over Canada during the 1967&#8211;2016 period (Brown et al., 2019). Only a few of 31 these investigated records show statistically significant trends, but in these cases the trend tends to be 32 negative. Findings in Brown et al. (2019) are similar for snow depth but opposite for snow density (the low 33 number of statistically significant trends tend to be positive). Trends in average snow depth, snow cover 34 extent, and snow onset and retreat dates also show heterogeneous spatial patterns over the U.S. (Knowles, 35 2015). 36 37 Some characteristics of the snow cover show same-sign trends over large parts of the continent. For example, 38 Kunkel et al. (2016) found a general decrease in the annual maximum of SWE between 1961 and 2015, but 39 again with trends generally not statistically significant (see Figure Atlas.43:). Vincent et al. (2015) also 40 report a general decrease in annual maximum SWE for snow monitoring stations across Canada between 41 1950 and 2012, as well as earlier dates for the occurrence of the snow-depth peak, and shorter snow season 42 duration. For the period of 1981 to 2015, Bush and Lemmen (2019) reported regional declines in snow cover 43 fraction over Canada in all seasons but most widespread from October to December. Analogously, Knowles 44 (2015) found decreases in snow season duration at the contiguous U.S. stations between 1950 and 2010 45 (using two complementary duration metrics). Mote et al. (2018) report marked declines in April 1st SWE at 46 most monitoring sites of the western US mountains between 1955 and 2016.  47 48 Attribution of causes to snow-related changes is often a complex task, as there are regional particularities in 49 climate change (Mioduszewski et al., 2014b). For example, at high latitudes, warming-induced melting may 50 be offset by precipitation increases (Rupp et al., 2013). Some event-based attribution studies indicate these 51 complex relationships. For example, an attribution study for the record low SWE values of winter 2014&#8211;15 52 in the western U.S. concluded that circumstantial Pacific sea surface temperature patterns were about twice 53 as important as anthropogenic warming in Oregon and Washington, with relatively smaller roles for both 54 causes in California (Mote et al., 2016).
