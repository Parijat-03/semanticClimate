The development of the literature reflects, among other factors, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the outcomes of its Kyoto Protocol and the goals of the Paris Agreement {13, 14, 15}, and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development {1, 4, 17}. Literature further highlights the growing role of non-state and sub-national actors in the global effort to address climate change, including cities, businesses, citizens, transnational initiatives and public-private entities {5, 8, 13}. It draws attention to the decreasing cost of some low-emission technologies {2, 6, 12} and the evolving role of international cooperation {14}, finance {15} and innovation {16}. Emerging literature examines the global spread of climate policies, strengthened mitigation actions in developing countries, sustained reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in some developed countries and the continuing challenges for mitigation. {2, 13} </span></div><div left="56.7" right="304.71" top="342.64"><span x0="56.7" y0="342.64" x1="304.71" style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.91; y0: 342.64; y1: 352.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There are ever closer linkages between climate change mitigation, development pathways and the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Development pathways largely drive GHG emissions and hence shape the mitigation challenge and the portfolio of available responses {4}. The co-benefits and risks of mitigation responses also differ according to stages of development and national capabilities {1, 2, 3, 4, 13}. Climate change mitigation framed in the context of sustainable development, equity, and poverty eradication, and rooted in the development aspirations of the society within which they take place, will be more acceptable, durable and effective. {1, 4, 17}</span></div><div left="56.7" right="304.74" top="210.65"><span x0="56.7" y0="210.65" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.91; y0: 210.65; y1: 220.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">This report includes new assessment approaches that go beyond those evaluated in the previous IPCC WGIII reports.
