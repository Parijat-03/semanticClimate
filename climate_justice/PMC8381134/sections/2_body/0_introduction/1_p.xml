It advocates for a scientific and political focus on climate change as the foremost body of climate knowledge production; positions itself as a translator of global environmental change at multiple science-policy nodes of engagement; and provides a platform for the governments of about 195 nation-states to take an active part in the establishment of climate change research questions and priorities. Informed by the insights of IPCC reports, two significant agreements have been produced: the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the Paris Agreement in 2015. The institution has also inspired the intellectual and organizational elements of other multi-stakeholder science-policy initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). However, the IPCC which consists of an international group of scientists has faced criticism for different organizational and functional biases which include a geographical bias favoring experts from the global north, a gender bias in favor of men, a disciplinary bias in favor of the natural sciences over the social sciences and humanities, and a cosmological bias favoring western science over indigenous knowledges (Beck and Mahony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Gustafsson and Berg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; Mach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>; Mahony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>; Vardy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2017</xref>).</p>
