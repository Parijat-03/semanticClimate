For the WEF, the <italic>near-term</italic> risk involves geo-economic tensions between the US and China risking global economic growth. As below, the real risk is of China&#8217;s accumulating power as the US empire unravels, threatening corporate interests with a state-centered model of development that may be more effective in addressing Brende&#8217;s <italic>long-term</italic> risks of climate change and deepening extreme weather events. The final risk is &#8216;technology,&#8217; such as AI, biotech and cyber-related risks as blind spots not &#8216;readily understood&#8217; (Brende <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). This appears to refer to the substantial known unknowns of bio-digital engineering transforming landscapes, agricultural practices, and food varieties (Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). They are issues of central concern to food producers and their global allies who value ecological farming, as we shall see below.</p>
