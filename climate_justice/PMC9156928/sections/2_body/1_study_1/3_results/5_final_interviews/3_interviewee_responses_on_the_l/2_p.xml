They were asked why they thought most people did not attend and why they themselves did not feel compelled to attend. As personal reasons were usually merged with speculations about other people's reasons, both these answers are compiled together in <xref rid="RSOS210006TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. The most common obstacles were (1) Zoom fatigue, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic (during this study, students had been attending classes on Zoom for over a year); (2) perception of a lack of opportunities to socialize normally given the climate events were only on Zoom; (3) school workload and (4) being too busy due to other responsibilities such as a job or community organizing.
