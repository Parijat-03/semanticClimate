Raworth&#8217;s &#8216;Doughnut for the Anthropocene&#8217; provides an inventive and useful combination of both the planetary boundaries and the SDGs (Raworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). The &#8216;doughnut&#8217; concept provides a succinct integration of two sets of boundaries, an ecological &#8216;ceiling&#8217; informed by the planetary boundaries work of Rockstr&#246;m et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>) and Steffen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>) and a social &#8216;floor&#8217; or foundation, informed by the SDGs. In this way, the doughnut presents two concentric radar charts representing the social and ecological boundaries, which together determine human wellbeing (Raworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). The so-called doughnut represents a type of compass which might be applied by national regional and local policy makers to broadly frame the debate on just transitions, by helping to navigating society to &#8220;an ecologically safe and socially just space&#8221; (Raworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>).</p>
