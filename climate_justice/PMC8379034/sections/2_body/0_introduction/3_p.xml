At the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), or more popularly known as the Earth Summit, the late Maurice Strong, the UNCED Secretary General, defined one of the &#8220;success&#8221; markers at the international environmental conference &#8220;as a minimum of an extra $10 billion a year of &#8216;new money&#8217; from Western countries to finance summit commitments in the Third World&#8221; (Pearce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1992</xref> p. 4).</p>
