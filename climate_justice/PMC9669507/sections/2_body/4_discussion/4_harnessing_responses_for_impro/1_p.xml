thanking journalists for their efforts in covering the pandemic and
complementing the models attempting to cast away the uncertainty about the
future. Additional supportive comments came in the form of suggestions such as
enhancing the predictive power of the models (<xref rid="bibr11-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Diakopoulos and Naaman, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Henrich and Holmes,
2013</xref>). Despite this supportive sentiment, other comments criticized
the models and the way they were visualized. Practitioners may find some of
these comments helpful in developing new communication tools (<xref rid="bibr21-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Kay, 2022</xref>) or shaping
best practices that data journalists could follow to achieve simplicity and
clarity in visualizing forecasts and scientific data.</p>
