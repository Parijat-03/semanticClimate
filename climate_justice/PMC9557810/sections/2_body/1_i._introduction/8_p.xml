<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The remote phase of engagement evolved around the production of short films by each
school and a collective documentary, as entry points to distil the core and common
pedagogic practices that have coalesced under the umbrella of HIC-AL. In this
context, the short films and documentary acted as catalysts for horizontal
conversations on the role of popular urbanism pedagogies in nurturing struggles for
habitat rights; that is, articulating critical and political learning processes as
pathways towards strategic change to address inequalities. Supported by La Sand&#237;a
Digital &#8211; a feminist collective of filmmakers based in Mexico &#8211; this horizontal
process involved four online workshops with around 15 participants each, between
August and November 2021, in which pedagogues and communication teams from each
school developed their story from a pedagogic viewpoint. These exchanges evolved
from oral accounts to audiovisual narratives and culminated in a fifth comparative
analysis workshop through which all participants identified the practices that make
their pedagogic approaches critical and counter-hegemonic. Between the workshops,
the pedagogic reflexion involved a larger number of participants, as each school
engaged in searches through their own archives, focus group discussions, one-to-one
interviews, storyboarding and filming.</p>
