Scholars, especially those in the Global North, have a moral responsibility to make space for their colleagues from the Global South to tell their truths, as well as to be allies of the marginalized and oppressed societal groups and voices. Building coalitions and synergies between different initiatives and movements for change, which are based on different knowledge and aim to unmake the current structures and status quo together with the underlying logics, are crucial for co-designing alternative ways forward&#8212;ways forward where justice, plurality, solidarity, resilience and resistance are both the means and the ends of the processes of change.</p>
