While generally not espousing justice in explicit terms, the EU&#8217;s consistent advocacy for ambitious and legally binding outcomes has enabled it to build coalitions with the most climate-vulnerable nations, leading to key breakthroughs in UNFCCC negotiations, such as the 2011 Durban platform for a new climate agreement and the 2015 Paris Agreement. The EU&#8217;s credibility in aligning itself with climate-vulnerable nations on questions of ambition has rested on its domestic record. There has been much questioning of the limitations of &#8216;leadership by example&#8217; in the years following the Copenhagen COP (von Luckef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2019</xref>: 18). However, others contend that credible implementation remains an important component of EU claims to leadership in international cooperation. As International Relations scholar Yan Xuetong observed, the EU &#8216;provides authoritative leadership in dealing with climate change, based on its higher achievements in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the 2010s than other international actors&#8217; (Yan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2019</xref>: 16).</p>
