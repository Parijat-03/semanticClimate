The Ministry&#8217;s priorities were reduced to the flexibilization of environmental norms and rules. In 2019, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported an increase in deforestation in the Amazon region, estimating that the records of fire outbreaks in August 2019 were the highest in 7&#160;years. The Brazilian government refuted the data, and the impasse led to institutional disagreements that culminated with Ricardo Galv&#227;o&#8217;s discharge from INPE&#8217;s general direction.</p>
