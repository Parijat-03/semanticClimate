This capacity forms the foundation for social workers to adapt their expertise from non-disaster scenarios to disaster settings, where they actively serve individuals and families impacted by catastrophic events. When extreme events disrupt various societal dimensions and trigger compounded influences on disaster survivors&#8217; health and well-being, social workers must be swiftly adapted into this multi-system influence context and collaborate with professionals from multidisciplinary backgrounds to develop resident-driven interdisciplinary solutions [<xref rid="B78-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This interdisciplinary cooperation connects different community-based networks and resources, enhances multi-stakeholder community engagement, and eventually contributes to healthy, resilient, and sustainable community development [<xref rid="B77-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The benefits from the positive community development, in turn, build the individual and family&#8217;s coping capacity for potential extreme events. </p>
