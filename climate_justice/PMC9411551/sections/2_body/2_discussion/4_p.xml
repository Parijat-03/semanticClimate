The recovery of lower-income and/or minority communities is often slower and less complete or successful. Previous research has shown, for instance, that lower-income households are less likely to be insured, or receive lower compensation from their insurer, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Indeed, insurance is often essential for a fast recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. More than this, the binary nature of risk determination (i.e., location in a 100-year floodplain&#8212;or not) in U.S. flood policy would suggest that location outside of the 100-year floodplain would be linked to lower perceived risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and would experience a more difficult recovery. Indeed, Billings et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. find that for the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Our finding that among land parcels outside of the floodplains Latina/x/o neighborhoods disproportionately experienced climate change-induced impacts suggests that these differentials in risk determination, risk messaging/signaling, and the plausible likelihood of having flood insurance could all further amplify inequalities during the disaster recovery process.</p>
