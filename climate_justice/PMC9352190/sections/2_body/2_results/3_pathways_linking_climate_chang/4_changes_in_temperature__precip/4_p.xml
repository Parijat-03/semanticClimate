For instance, poor water quality promotes the spread of water-borne and food-borne diseases such as, but not limited to, typhoid, cholera, Shigella, leptospirosis, amoebic dysentery, schistosomiasis, Guinea worm, and viral hepatitis <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Compared to the general population, PLHIVs are more susceptible to contracting these climate-sensitive diarrheal pathogens as well as facing a higher risk of severe outcomes due to their weakened immune system [<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Access to clean water and sanitation facilities must therefore be prioritized in areas with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and high levels of climate vulnerability.</p>
