<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To achieve our objectives, we examine the frameworks that suggest analytic pathways for conceptualising marginalisation processes. Mittal, Pereram, and Korkeala (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) outline four structural drivers underpinning marginalisation processes: (1) an inadequate asset base &#8211; natural, physical, financial, human, social and cultural; (2) poor access to services and infrastructure &#8211; health, energy, water, transport and markets; (3) weak political voice, empowerment and institutional governance; and (4) identity-based discrimination. The converse of the first three structural drivers &#8211; assets, services and voice &#8211; equally act as &#8220;enablers&#8221; to lift people out of poverty. This is not true, the authors argue, of the fourth driver. The processes of identity-based discrimination &#8211; and the social norms which underpin and &#8220;rationalise&#8221; this &#8211; are an underlying driver hampering marginalised people from utilising the first three drivers to their advantage. This interlocking process is depicted in Figure A1 (Online Appendix).</p>
