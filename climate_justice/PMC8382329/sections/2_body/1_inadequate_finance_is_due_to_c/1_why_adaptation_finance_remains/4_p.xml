Abadie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>) explain the factors behind this, as fewer risks, known investment environments, and ancillary local benefits, such as clean air and improved infrastructure. But doing more adaptation in developed countries may actually discourage them from ambitious mitigation, an early fear that now is evident. Two decades ago Michaelowa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2001</xref>) argued that more adaptation in the Global North without adequate mitigation made the Global South worse off. This was the rationale for why the UNFCCC put a single-minded focus on mitigation, with adaptation just as an afterthought. So, in the initial years, there were closet adaptationists, who feared going public (Burton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>).</p>
