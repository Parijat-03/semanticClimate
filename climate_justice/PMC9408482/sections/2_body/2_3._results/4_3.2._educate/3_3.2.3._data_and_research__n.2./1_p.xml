Similarly, Tuvalu and Lesotho have endorsed the same need. Others, including Chad, Kiribati, and Sao TEP, need study teams capable (N2.2) of vulnerability analysis, climate risk mapping, and delivering NDC targets (Tanzania). Most of the LDPCs, including Angola and Guinea Bissau, have reported the absence of local climate data and a lack of expertise (N2.2) in the data collection. Uganda requires studies on smart and sustainable agriculture practices according to the local climate infrastructure.</p>
