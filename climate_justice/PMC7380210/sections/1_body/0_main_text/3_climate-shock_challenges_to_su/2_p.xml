There are many ways to mitigate shocks. For supply chains, we can minimize temporary shock and disruption effects while building capacity to cope with the long-term shifts. A number of supply-chain &#8220;hotspots&#8221; for potential impacts of climate shocks exist;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> these hotspots range from physical infrastructure transitions to locational and product concerns.</p>
