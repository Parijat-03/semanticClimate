Moving from the bottom to the top along the left leg, and thus increasing the weight of capability, increases the reduction target for Germany. The same holds when moving along the base from right to left, thus increasing the weight of responsibility (in this case the relevance of considering historic emissions). Conversely, increasing the weight of equality (i.e., moving down along the right-hand leg) reduces emission reduction targets, as an increase in the weighting of this dimension necessarily decreases the weight of the other two dimensions, each of which we find empirically for Germany to imply stronger reduction target increases. The lightness of the gradient in the bottom right-hand corner, indicating the least required emission reductions, implies that avoiding consideration of both capability and responsibility principles reduces emission reductions to a minimum.</p>
