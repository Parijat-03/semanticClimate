Since managed land may include carbon dioxide (CO2) removals not considered as &#8216;anthropogenic&#8217; in some of the scientific literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with CO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories.
