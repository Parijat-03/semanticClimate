Past events affected areas tens to hundreds of kilometres downstream (Carrivick and Tweed, 2016). Retreating glaciers produced lakes at their fronts in many high mountain regions in recent decades (Frey et al., 2010; Gardelle et al., 2011; Loriaux and Casassa, 2013). Lake systems in High Mountain Asia also often developed on the surface of downwasting, low-slope glaciers where they coalesced from temporally variable supraglacial lakes (Benn et al., 2012; Narama et al., 2017).

Exceptions occurred and are expected to occur in the future for few lakes where evaporation, runoff and reduced melt water in&#64258;ux in total led to a negative water balance (Sun et al., 2018a). Also, advancing glaciers temporarily dammed rivers, lake sections, or fjords (Stearns et al., 2015), for instance through surging (Round et al., 2017), causing particularly large &#64258;oods once the ice dams breached. Outbursts from water bodies in and under glaciers are able to cause &#64258;oods similar to those from surface lakes but little is known about the processes involved and any trends under climate change. In some cases, the glacier thermal regime played a role so that climate driven changes in thermal regime are expected to alter the hazard potential, depending on local conditions (Gilbert et al., 2012).

A decrease in moraine-dammed glacier lake outburst &#64258;oods in recent decades suggests a response of lake outburst activity being delayed by some decades with respect to glacier retreat (Harrison et al., 2018) but inventories might signi&#64257;cantly underestimate the number of events (Veh et al., 2018). For the Himalaya, Veh et al. (2019)161 found no increase in the number of glacier lake outburst &#64258;oods since the late 1980s. The degradation of permafrost and the melting of ice buried in lake dams have been shown to lower dam stability and contribute to outburst &#64258;oods in many high mountain regions (Fujita et al., 2013; Erokhin et al., 2017; Narama et al., 2017).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.48" top="423.61"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.48; y0: 423.61; y1: 433.11; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="423.61" x1="571.48">Floods originating from the combination of rapidly melting snow and intense rainfall, referred to as rain-on-snow events, are some of the most damaging &#64258;oods in mountain areas (Pomeroy et al., 2016; Il Jeong and Sushama, 2018). The hydrological response of a catchment to a rain-on-snow event depends on the characteristics of the precipitation event, but also on turbulent &#64258;uxes driven by wind and humidity, which typically provide most of the melting energy during such events (Pomeroy et al., 2016), and the state of the snowpack, in particular the liquid water content (W&#252;rzer et al., 2016). An increase  in the occurrence of rain-on-snow events in high-elevation zones, and a decrease at the lowest elevations have been reported (Western USA, 1949&#8211;2003, McCabe et al. (2007); Oregon, 1986&#8211;2010, Sur&#64258;eet and Tullos (2013); Switzerland, 1972&#8211;2016, Moran-Tej&#233;da et al. (2016), central Europe, 1950&#8211;2010, Freudiger et al. (2014)). These trends are consistent with studies carried out at the scale of the Northern Hemisphere (Putkonen and Roe, 2003; Ye et al., 2008; Cohen et al., 2015). There are no studies found on this topic in Africa and South America.
