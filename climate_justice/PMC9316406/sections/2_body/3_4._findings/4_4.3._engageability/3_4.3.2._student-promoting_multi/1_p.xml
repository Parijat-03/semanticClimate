GSW-specific practice always highlights community residents&#8217; collaborative engagement in post-disaster community reconstruction and recovery [<xref rid="B77-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This stimulates the trainee to re-evaluate how social workers&#8217; community-based expertise could empower grassroots efforts to promote community development in disaster settings. Specifically, the trainee recalled her previous experience in coordinating summer activities and camps for school children. This job established her connections with different community members and agencies, such as local bakeries and recreation facilities (e.g., swimming pools and indoor playgrounds). This network enhanced the school children&#8217;s summer experiences and supported their mental and health well-being. The trainee discovered that these community stakeholders she contacted actually desired to &#8216;give back&#8217; to their communities, especially by helping vulnerable dwellers but did not know how to actualize their well-wishes. This highlights the value of community-based social work interventions and the need for social work practitioners and other social service workers to access and motivate these community-based assets. When transferring into disaster settings, the established networks and connections could swiftly engage diverse stakeholders in disaster-driven community development.</p>
