<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A rule or order issued by governmental executive authorities or regulatory agencies and having the force of law.</p>
<p>Regulations implement policies and are mostly specific for particular groups of people, legal entities or targeted activities. Regulation is also the act of designing and imposing rules or orders. Informational, transactional, administrative and political constraints in practice limit the regulatorâs capability for implementing preferred policies.</p>
