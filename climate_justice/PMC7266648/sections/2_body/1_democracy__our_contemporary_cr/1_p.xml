Active definitions for democracy lie across a spectrum of performances and values, from the &#8220;minimalist&#8221; versions that captures simple measures such as voter registration and turnout, to &#8220;maximalist&#8221; definitions that include activities like associational membership, active information seeking and civic dialogue (Dahl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1971</xref>). The discussion of democracy in this article focuses on a maximalist value of equality over other values, such as maximal individual liberty. Given the recent prevenance of &#8220;collective crises&#8221; like the climate and pandemic, prioritising maximal individual liberty contrasts the necessary collective nature of contemporary, complex societies (Wildavsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>). Prioritising values like maximal individual liberty can be unsustainable and/or create inequalities that structurally undermine participation by others through self-interest (Wildavsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>).</p>
