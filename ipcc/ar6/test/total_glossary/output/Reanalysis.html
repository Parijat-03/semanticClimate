<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Reanalyses are created by processing past meteorological or oceanographic data using fixed state-of-the-art weather forecasting or ocean circulation models with <em>data assimilation</em> techniques. They are used to provide estimates of variables such as historical atmospheric temperature and wind or oceanographic temperature and currents, and other quantities. Using fixed data assimilation avoids effects from the changing analysis system that occur in operational analyses. Although continuity is improved, global reanalyses still suffer from changing coverage and biases in the observing systems.</p></dd>
