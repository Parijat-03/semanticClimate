First, it speaks to the key topic of business regulation, considering direct regulatory approaches such as strict supply regulations or bans compared to the current dominance of market approaches, raising issues of depoliticisation and non-decision. This contribution is a response to earlier calls (Pearse &amp; B&#246;hm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>) for experts and policy makers, and indeed academics, to raise the profile of such alternatives. Second, it aims to fill the gap in the business ethics literature on how direct regulation is rendered invisible as identified by Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>), by turning to the literature on market ethics in which the normalisation of market thinking is the driver of this invisibility. The work of Sandel and others reveals not just the weaknesses of MBMs in practice due to issues of fairness and corruption, but highlights how the continued proposals of MBMs reflects the invisibility of alternatives and can also be used as a &#8220;discourse of climate delay&#8221; (Lamb et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>) to avoid direct regulation, even when the MBMs are not even enacted. The work of both Felli and Sandel also reveals that this process of depoliticisation entrenches existing economic relations dominated by private actors, rendering any climate action that may threaten this economic model even more difficult.</p>
