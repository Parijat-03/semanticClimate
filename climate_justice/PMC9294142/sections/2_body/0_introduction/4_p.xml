<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This is an important issue as, more broadly, building and construction counts for 39% of carbon emissions worldwide (UN Environment and International Energy Agency, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), while operational emissions from energy used to cool, heat, and light buildings accounts for 28% of global carbon emissions (World Green Building Council, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). With this awareness, there is an emerging trend in stadium or arena design and construction to capitalize on environmental sustainability initiatives and gain either the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 Environmental Management certification or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Academic research focused on new stadia and urban development has also expanded recently (Mallen and Chard, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kellison et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Triantafyllidis et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For instance, Kellison and Hong (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) identified growing pressure faced by architects and sport franchise owners to incorporate environmentally sustainable features into new stadia design, and found that economic savings over the lifespan of the facility is a key driver in the adoption of pro-environmental architecture and design. However, we are not aware of related published research on the potential environmental impacts of shadow stadia.</p>
