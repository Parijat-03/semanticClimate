Industrial systems will suffer most from indirect impacts leading to rises in the costs of water, feeding, housing, transport and the destruction of infrastructure due to extreme events, as well as an increasing volatility of the price of feedstuff which increases the level of uncertainty in production (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016b; Lopez-i-Gelats 2014). Mixed systems and industrial or landless livestock systems could encounter several risk factors mainly due to the variability of grain availability and cost, and low adaptability of animal genotypes (Nardone et al. 2010). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="315.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 315.13; y1: 324.63; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="315.13" x1="307.6">Considering the diverse typologies of animal production, from grazing to industrial, Rivera-Ferre et al.

For instance, in China changes in precipitation were a&#160;more important factor in nomadic migration than temperature (Pei and Zhang 2014). There is some evidence that recent years have already seen an increase in grassland fires in parts of China and tropical Asia (IPCC 2012). In Mongolia, grassland productivity has declined by 20&#8211;30% over the latter half of the 20th century, and ewe average weight reduced by 4&#160;kg on an annual basis, or about&#160;8% since 1980 (Batima et al. 2008). Substantial decline in cattle herd sizes can be due to increased mortality and forced off-take (Megersa et al. 2014). Important, but less studied, is the impact of the interaction of grazing patterns with climate change on grassland composition. Spence et al. (2014) showed that climate change effects on Mongolia mountain steppe could be contingent on land use. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="471.15"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 471.15; y1: 480.65; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="471.15" x1="566.1">Conflicts due to resource scarcity, as well as other socio-political factors (Benjaminsen et al. 2012) aggravated by climate change, has differentiated impact on women.

For instance, during environmental disasters, livestock holders have been shown to be more vulnerable to food insecurity than their crop-producing counterparts because of limited economic access to food and unfavourable market exchange rates (Nori et al. 2005). Sami reindeer herders in Finland showed reduced freedom of action in response to climate change due to loss of habitat, increased predation, and presence of economic and legal constraints (Tyler et al. 2007; Pape and L&#246;ffler 2012). In Tibet, emergency aid has provided shelters and privatised communally owned rangeland, which have increased the vulnerability of pastoralists to climate change (Yeh et al. 2014; N&#230;ss 2013). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="396.98" top="231.18"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 231.18; y1: 240.68; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="231.18" x1="396.98">Projected impacts. </span><span style="x0: 400.05; x1: 404.27; y0: 231.18; y1: 240.68; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="400.05" y0="231.18" x1="566.11">The impacts of climate change on global rangelands and livestock have received comparatively less attention than the impacts on crop production.
