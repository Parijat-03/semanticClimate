This remains one of the major causes for conflicting relations between the state and sections of society that do not always recognize the state authority but rely on traditional norms and political authority. Contrary to this reality, the EU institutions and global governance organizations (World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, OECD) collaborate exclusively with state organs, while ignoring the evidence that the state does not always represent all citizens equally (Kojola and Pellow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>; Sakshi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>) and plays an important part in oppression, violence and coercion (Dunlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021a</xref>). This leads to consolidation of state control of people and territories that previously operated more independently, fostering thus state-sponsored dispossession and violence (Ramcilovic-Suominen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2021</xref>; Menton&#160;and Le Billon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>).</p>
