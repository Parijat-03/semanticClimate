Numerous community-facing events have been held including a collaboration between Northern Ireland Science Festival in which staff members from the School of Biological Sciences have presented research recognising the global and local impacts of climate change and ideas on how to mitigate these. Numerous working groups within the university strive towards better climate action, such as the QUB Students&#8217; Union (QUBSU) Climate Action Group, which communicate regularly with interested students and staff. Following the wider university&#8217;s example, the medical school should continue to establish its community partnerships and hold events related to planetary health and sustainable healthcare.</p>
