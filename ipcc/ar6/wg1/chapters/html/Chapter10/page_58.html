(2010) showed that cold anomalies in the tropical Atlantic favour wetter conditions by inducing an upper-tropospheric flow towards the equator, which, via advection of vorticity, leads to ascending motion over south-eastern South America (Figure&#160;10.12a). Monerie et&#160;al. (2019) supported this argument showing a&#160;negative relationship between south-eastern South America precipitation and the AMV index (Huang et&#160;al., 2015) using an AGCM coupled to an ocean mixed-layer model with nudged SSTs.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.78" top="582.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="582.6" x1="298.78" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The positive trend of precipitation has also been attributed to anthropogenic GHG emissions and stratospheric ozone depletion. CMIP5 models only show a&#160;positive trend when including anthropogenic forcings (Vera and D&#237;az, 2015). These results were supported by Knutson and Zeng (2018) based on univariate detection/attribution analysis of annual mean trends for the 1901&#8211;2010 and 1951&#8211;2010 periods. However, the main features of summer mean precipitation and variability of South America are still not well-represented in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; D&#237;az and Vera, 2017; D&#237;az et&#160;al., 2021). This motivates the construction of ensembles that exclude the worst performing models (Section&#160;10.3.3.4). The construction of ensembles of CMIP5 historical simulations with realistic representation of precipitation anomalies with opposite sign over south-eastern South America and eastern Brazil showed that the trend since the 1950s could be related to changes in precipitation characteristics only when simulations included anthropogenic forcings (D&#237;az and Vera, 2017). GHG emissions have been related to increased precipitation in south-eastern South America through three different mechanisms (Figure&#160;10.12a). First, GHG warming induces a&#160;non-zonally uniform pattern of SST warming that includes a&#160;warming pattern over the Indian and Pacific oceans that excites wave responses over South America (Junquas et&#160;al., 2013). Zonally uniform SST patterns of warming alone lead to precipitation signals opposite to those observed in an AGCM (Junquas et&#160;al., 2013). Second, GHG radiative forcing drives an expansion of the Hadley cell so that its descending branch moves poleward from the region, generating anomalous ascending motion and precipitation (H. Zhang et&#160;al., 2016; Saurral et&#160;al., 2019). The third mechanism by which increased GHG can contribute to increased precipitation in the region is through a&#160;delay of the stratospheric polar vortex breakdown. As depicted in Figure&#160;10.12a, both stratospheric ozone depletion and increased GHGs have contributed to the later breakdown of the polar vortex in recent decades (McLandress et&#160;al., 2010; Wu and Polvani, 2017; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019). Mindlin et&#160;al. (2020) developed future atmospheric circulation storylines (Section&#160;10.3.4.2, Box&#160;10.2) for Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes with the CMIP5 models and found that for south-eastern South America summer precipitation, increases are related to the late-spring breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. The connecting mechanism is through a&#160;lagged southward shift of the jet stream (Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019), which enhances cyclonic activity over the region (Wu and Polvani, 2017).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.81" top="78.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="78.6" x1="298.81" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A common feature among the above discussed studies is that even if global models simulate positive trends when forced with GHG and/or stratospheric ozone, these trends are in general smaller </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.31; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Figure&#160;10.12d). D&#237;az&#160;et&#160;al. (2021) showed that to capture the observed trend a&#160;multi-model ensemble of SMILEs is needed. Out of the 12 large ensembles examined (with ensemble size varying in&#160;the 16&#8211;100&#160;range), only seven simulated the observed trend within their range. This could partly be explained by model biases in mean precipitation and its interannual variability. In the sub-ensemble of six models that reproduce reasonably well the observed spatial patterns of mean precipitation and interannual variability, the ensemble mean spread is lower, and the forced response, taken as the multi-model ensemble mean, is slightly more positive than that of the six poorly performing models. The signal-to-noise ratio, estimated as the ratio of the forced response to the spread due to internal variability, is also slightly higher for the best-performing models, suggesting that selecting the best-performing models may have an influence on both attribution of the observed trend and emergence of the forced response in future (Section&#160;10.4.3).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="339.63" top="510.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="510.6" x1="339.63" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 340.12; x1: 344.7; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="340.12" y0="510.6" x1="399.9">high confidence </span><span x0="400.39" y0="510.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 400.39; x1: 403.2; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that South-Eastern South America summer precipitation has increased since the beginning of the 20th&#160;century.

Drought is a&#160;regular feature of the south-western North America&#8217;s climate regime, as can be seen in both the modern record, and through paleoclimate reconstructions (Cook et&#160;al., 2010; Woodhouse et&#160;al., 2010; Williams et&#160;al., 2020), as well as in future climate model projections (Cook et&#160;al., 2015a). Since the early 1980s, which were relatively wet in terms of precipitation and streamflow, the region has experienced major multi-year droughts such as the turn-of-the-century drought that lasted from 1999 to 2005, and the most recent and extreme 2012&#8211;2014 drought that in certain locations is perhaps unprecedented in the last millennium (Section&#160;8.3.1.6; Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014; Robeson, 2015). Shorter dry spells also happened between these multi-year droughts making 1980 to present a&#160;period with an exceptionally steep trend from wet to dry (Figure&#160;10.13a), leading to strong declines in Rio Grande and Colorado river flows (Lehner et&#160;al., 2017b; Udall and Overpeck, 2017). While robust attribution of this trend is complicated by the large natural variability in this region, the 20th&#160;century warming has been suggested to increase the chances for hydrological drought periods by lowering runoff efficiency (Woodhouse et&#160;al., 2016; Lehner et&#160;al., 2017b; Woodhouse and Pederson, 2018) and affecting evapotranspiration (Williams et&#160;al., 2020).
