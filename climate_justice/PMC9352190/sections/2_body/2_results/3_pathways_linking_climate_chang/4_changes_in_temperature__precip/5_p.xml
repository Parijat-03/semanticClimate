For instance, high temperature accelerates the larval development of <italic>Anopheles gambiae s.s.</italic> mosquitoes, a vector for malaria <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Moreover, higher levels of precipitation are found to accelerate the population growth of mosquitoes carrying dengue, scrub typhus, and Japanese encephalitis, thereby facilitating their rapid spread <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Similar with water- and food-borne diseases, mosquito-borne diseases can result in more aggressive presentations of vector-borne infections in PLHIVs <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
