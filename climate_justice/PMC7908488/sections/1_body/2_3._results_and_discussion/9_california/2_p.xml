<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Temperature disparities experienced by Latinx California neighborhoods were similarly larger than those experienced outside the state. The highest-decile block groups in terms of Latinx population in the California sample were 2.6 and 2.3 &#176;C (4.7&#176; and 4.1 &#176;F) warmer on extreme heat and average heat days respectively, compared with 1.5 and 1.3 &#176;C (2.7 and 3.1 &#176;F) for Southwestern cities outside of California. The largest differences occurred in the Inland Empire (3.6 &#176;C (6.5 &#176;F for an average heat day)), Palm Springs (3.8 &#176;C (6.9 &#176;F for an extreme heat day)), and Los Angeles (3.6 &#176;C (6.5 &#176;F for an extreme heat day)). Nighttime temperature disparities were not as great: 1.1 &#176;C (2 &#176;F) for California Latinx neighborhoods compared to 0.6 &#176;C (1.1 &#176;F) for Southwestern Latinx neighborhoods outside the state.</p>
