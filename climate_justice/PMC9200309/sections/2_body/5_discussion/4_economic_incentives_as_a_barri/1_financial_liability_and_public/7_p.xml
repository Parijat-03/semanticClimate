<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <italic toggle="yes">JAM v International Finance Corp</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] (IFC), a group of Indian villagers brought a case against IFC, the investment arm of the World Bank, before the US Supreme Court, because it had financed the construction of a coal fired plant in India, which polluted the surrounding area. Prior to this case, the IFC held immunity from such prosecutions, in the same manner enjoyed by foreign governments. This ruling overturned the IFC&#8217;s immunity from liability for its investments. Because the case involved the World Bank, such a ruling exemplifies how financial entities can be liable in law for financing harm to the environment and public health.</p>
