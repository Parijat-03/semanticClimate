As such, climate change adaptation is highly reliant on normative assessments of responsibility for health protection. These links between responsibility, climate justice, and adaptation evaluation for human health can be addressed by focusing on a normative understanding of public health&#8217;s role in advancing social justice [<xref rid="B47-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and could contribute to new evaluation approaches in health and climate change adaptation research.</p>
