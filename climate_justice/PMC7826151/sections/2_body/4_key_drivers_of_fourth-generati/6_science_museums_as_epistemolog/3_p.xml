It is one of the earliest exhibitions to challenge the status of scientific knowledge and epistemic authority. Different voices, ways of knowing, and knowledge systems are celebrated. Other displays interrogate episodes (such as slavery, eugenics, the Holocaust, and intelligence testing) in the history and practice of science. Intentionally designed to be &#8220;a provocative exhibition about bias, prejudice, and discrimination in science&#8221; (Livingstone, Pedretti, &amp; Soren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>, p. 356), <italic>A Question of Truth</italic> examines largely uncontested territory about the nature of science and examines historical repercussions and legacies of scientific pursuits, decisions, and subsequent actions.</p>
