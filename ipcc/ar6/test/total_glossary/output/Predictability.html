<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The extent to which future states of a system may be predicted based on knowledge of current and past states of the system. Because knowledge of the <em>climate systemâs</em> past and current states is generally imperfect, as are the models that utilize this knowledge to produce a <em>climate prediction</em>, and because the <em>climate system</em> is inherently <em>non-linear</em> and <em>chaotic</em>, predictability of the climate system is inherently limited. Even with arbitrarily accurate models and observations, there may still be limits to the predictability of such a non-linear system (AMS, 2021).</p>
