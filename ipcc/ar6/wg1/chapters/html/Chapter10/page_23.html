Recent studies suggest that our ability to remove biases quickly diminishes for sparse networks (Gubler et&#160;al., 2017; Lindau and Venema, 2018a). This affects early instrumental data and observations that are not strongly correlated between stations, such as wind and humidity (Chimani et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="642.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="642.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 642.6; y1: 652.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Second, in addition to systematic errors, homogenized data also suffer from random errors, introduced by the homogenization process. These errors are largest at the station level but are also present in network-averaged signals (Lindau and Venema, 2018b). These errors are determined by the break time series, as well as the noise series and the performance of the homogenization method, are spatially correlated, and have an impact on activities such as interpolation and statistical post-processing of climate simulations (Section&#160;10.2.3.1). Third, the above discussion pertains to the homogenization of monthly and annual means. Homogenization of daily variability around the mean is more difficult. For daily data, specific correction methods are used (Della-Marta and Wanner, 2006; Mestre et&#160;al., 2011; Trewin, 2013; C. Zhou et&#160;al., 2021) that are able to improve the homogeneity of test cases, although recent independent validation efforts were not able to show much improvement (Chimani et&#160;al., 2018). The difference with homogenization methods of monthly and annual means may stem from assumptions on the nature of inhomogeneities for daily data, which are not yet well understood (Chimani et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="70.85" top="402.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="402.6" x1="70.85" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 58.99; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">It is </span><span style="x0: 70.09; x1: 74.14; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="70.09" y0="402.6" x1="125.83">virtually certain </span><span x0="125.07" y0="402.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 125.07; x1: 127.89; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that statistical homogenization methods reduce the uncertainties of long-term estimates. Considering a&#160;decomposition of the long-term warming error into a&#160;bias and a&#160;noise uncertainty around the bias, the (trend) bias especially will be reduced, but also most of the noise uncertainty. This conclusion is based on our understanding of the causes of inhomogeneities and their statistical nature combined with the design principles of statistical homogenization methods, as well as on analytical (Lindau and Venema, 2018b), numerical (Venema et&#160;al., 2012; Williams et&#160;al., 2012) and empirical validation studies (Hausfather et&#160;al., 2016; Gubler et&#160;al., 2017; Killick et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="270.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="270.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The above section is about the homogenization of land stations. Satellite data has its own issues and methods for homogenization (Brinckmann et&#160;al., 2013; Huang et&#160;al., 2015; Brogniez et&#160;al., 2016). The homogenization of radiosonde data and land station data use similar methods (Haimberger et&#160;al., 2012; Jovanovic et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="145.8" top="198.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="198.48" x1="145.8" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 198.48; y1: 208.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.3 Data Scarcity</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="174.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="174.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Data scarcity arises largely due to the lack of maintenance of observing stations, inaccessibility of the data held in national networks, and uneven spatial distribution of stations that lead to a&#160;low density in many regions. This is particularly problematic when trying to assess regional climate change, for which a&#160;high density of observational data is desirable. Although in several regions numerous stations provide (monthly) data covering more than 100&#160;years for both temperature and precipitation (GCOS, 2015), large areas of the world remain sparsely covered. The post-1990 decline in the total number of stations contributing to the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre&#160;(GPCC) monthly product may be related to delays </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.78; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">because GPCC is the result of a&#160;single time scale, single Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and single data collection centre.

(2017) made some assumptions about GPCC-available gauges and indicated that only 1.6% of Earth&#8217;s surface lies within 10&#160;km of a&#160;rain gauge, and many areas of the world are beyond 100&#160;km from the nearest rain gauge. Data scarcity is especially critical over Africa (Nikulin et&#160;al., 2012; Dike et&#160;al., 2018) but the apparent data scarcity could be due to reasons other than actual paucity of data, as stated earlier. For instance, over South Africa, the number of weather stations collecting daily temperature used in the fourth version of the Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset (CRUTEM4, Osborn and Jones, 2014) has significantly declined since 1980 (Archer et&#160;al., 2018). Although CRUTEM4 has now been replaced by CRUTEM5 (Osborn et&#160;al., 2021) it has yet to take advantage of the significant international efforts to curate and make available improved global holdings (Rennie et&#160;al., 2014) which increased the global available station count for monthly mean temperatures. This includes additional stations from many African countries. The apparent decline in stations since the 1980s could also be due to countries not contributing their data to the SYNOP/CLIMAT networks for reasons other than having non-operational stations.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="402.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="402.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.61; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Even in Europe, precipitation station density in the widely used E-OBS gridded dataset varies largely in space and time across regions (Prein and Gobiet, 2017). This variability is partly due to the reluctance of some data owners to share their data with an international effort. Regardless of the reason, low station density is a&#160;major source of uncertainty (Isotta et&#160;al., 2015). Kirchengast et&#160;al. (2014) and O and Foelsche (2019) found that at least 2 to 5 (12) stations are required for capturing the area-averaged precipitation amount of heavy summer precipitation events on a&#160;daily (hourly) basis with a&#160;normalized root-mean-square error of less than 20%. Like the E-OBS dataset, gridded daily temperature and precipitation datasets are being developed for other regions of the world. Examples include south-east Asia (SA-OBS, Van den Besselaar et&#160;al., 2017), and Latin America and West Africa (ICA&amp;D, Van den Besselaar et&#160;al., 2015). Despite the uneven distribution of stations in space and time, the value in these initiatives is illustrated by the large number of studies in which the data product is used. This is the case, for instance, in the work of Condom et&#160;al. (2020) over the Andes, a&#160;region with prominent data scarcity, and the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses project over West Africa (AMMA; e.g.,&#160;Lebel and Ali, 2009). There have been efforts to reduce data scarcity through initiatives such as the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI, Thorne et&#160;al., 2011), GHCND, and the Expanding Met Office Hadley Centre ISD with quality-controlled, sub-daily station data from 1931 (HadISD, Dunn et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="102.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="102.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Data scarcity arising from changing coverage in observation station networks results in substantial problems for climate monitoring (e.g.,&#160;trend analysis of extreme events requires high temporal and spatial resolutions) or model evaluation (Section&#160;10.3.3.1).
