Much of the economic inequality in regard to homeownership that exists today&#8212;as well as the segregation between people of color (especially African-Americans) and white Americans with respect to living areas&#8212;can be directly traced to slavery and the long succession of deliberately racist laws and policies that followed after. Rothstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>) observed that not long after the end of the Civil War, the South adopted segregation laws (Jim Crow laws), and segregationist laws and policies soon spread to many other parts of the country where formerly enslaved people had moved after the Civil War. Where small towns often expelled black populations altogether, larger cities adopted overtly racist ordinances, such as prohibiting African-Americans from purchasing homes in white areas (Rothstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>). Throughout the early 1900s, zoning and land use laws were similarly used to advantage white people and to disadvantage black people with respect to land and homeownership, such as by allowing development of industrial and other commercial uses (such as bars, prostitution, or liquor stores) in an area if African Americans began to move into the area, contributing to the destruction of neighborhoods and the creation of slums (Rothstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>).</p>
