Here the idea is that the public sector should not be directing funds where the private sector is already investing. Rather, limited public investments should be directed towards transformative technologies and markets &#8211; and to attract new and additional private sector financing (Escalante et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). In the process of planning, financing and implementing adaptation actions in the context of agricultural and rural development, two key concepts differentiate climate finance from traditional ODA; <italic>new and additional resources</italic> calls for funding to be clearly oriented towards quantifiable and measurable climate targets that can be distinguished from traditional development resources, and <italic>agreed full incremental costs</italic> requires a technical analysis that directly attributes the partial or full cost of an intervention to climate change drivers (Brown et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>).</p>
