As temperatures continue to rise in the South, combined with the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, what the computer models project is a fairly substantial migration northward toward the Mountain West or the Northwest and the Northeast, as well as the Upper Midwest. &#8220;With time,&#8221; writes Lustgarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>), &#8220;the bottom half of the country grows inhospitable, dangerous, and hot&#8221; so that &#8220;something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest&#8212;from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California&#8212;decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment.&#8221; But what about those who do not, or more importantly <italic>cannot</italic>, make the move northward, whether due to health conditions and/or financial constraints? Lustgarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) is clear about the data, with their important implications for pastoral theology and spiritual care: not surprisingly, those who stay behind will be &#8220;disproportionately poor and elderly.&#8221;</p>
