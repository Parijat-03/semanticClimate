Keith and his colleagues aimed to conduct a series of scientific balloon flights to test the cooling capacity of SRM <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> in Sweden in June 2021 (<xref rid="bibr30-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Temple, 2021</xref>), but this was cancelled due to opposition from environmentalists, scientists and indigenous communities.<sup>

</sup> Regarding CDR projects, the Swiss company Climeworks developed a CO<sub>2</sub> air capture technology able to store it in geological formations. Other geoengineering techniques include bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation (<xref rid="bibr31-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Waller et al., 2021</xref>). BECCS captures and stores CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from the combustion of biomass, permanently removing it from the atmosphere (<xref rid="bibr8-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2018</xref>). Afforestation projects &#8211; such as the Haryana cooperative afforestation project (India) or the Guangxi watershed project (China) &#8211; &#8216;increase the plant and soil sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> through photosynthesis&#8217; (<xref rid="bibr36-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Other proposals being discussed include the construction of space reflectors or the genetic manipulation of plants to enhance their ability to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (<xref rid="bibr24-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Oxford Geoengineering Programme, 2018</xref>).</p>
