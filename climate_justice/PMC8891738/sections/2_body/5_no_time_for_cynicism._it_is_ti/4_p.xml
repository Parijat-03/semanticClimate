Similarly to all of the previous revolutions aligned with the discovery of new energy sources, installation of energy infrastructure and development of new end-use technologies were the factors that drove industrialization, employment, innovation and empowerment. In my discussions and consultations with youth representatives, always two pillars come up as necessary to support their full and meaningful involvement. First of all, there is a need to enhance access to quality future-proof skills. Skills for the job market of tomorrow are still not being tought sufficiently at educational institutions, creating education-employment gap and closing many job opportunities for young graduates, especially from developing world. Furthermore, very often entrepreneurial attidutes are not nurtured sufficiently during education and training programmes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn23">23</xref> Secondly, the environment is not enabling young innovators and entrepreneurs with optimal regulation, access to finance and technology exchange to foster young women and men to take calculated risks of starting their own business and exploring their idea, that leads to innovation and job creation.</p>
