This is because the Ancient Greek notion of <italic>eudaimonia</italic> plays a major role in both virtue ethics and <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Sen, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Sen, 1999</xref> Capability Approach. For thinkers such as Aristotle, eudaimonia meant living well (or wellbeing) and was to be achieved through virtuosity and especially by seeking to bring out the best in oneself (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Ryff and Singer, 2008</xref>). After all, in ancient Greek the prefix <italic>eu</italic> means good or well, whereas <italic>daimon</italic> is a noun with multiple and complex meanings that often refers to a quasi-divine, moral mode of being that people can inhabit.</p>
