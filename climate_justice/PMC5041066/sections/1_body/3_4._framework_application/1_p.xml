Adaptation planners could also profit from application of this framework to assist them in design and evaluation of measures. Policymakers and researchers can choose indicators from each domain most relevant to their research question. The framework stresses the role of determinants of health in climate adaptation, and targets the connections between adaptation and the domains as opposed to the less easily assessable associations between adaptation and health outcomes.</p>
