Climate change introduces new questions for scholars interested in such inequality in urban settings. While environmental injustice refers mainly to unequal exposure to industrial pollution, the concept is increasingly applied to unequal vulnerability to climate threats, at both the global and local levels. Globally, the countries most responsible for emitting carbon dioxide are best resourced to protect themselves, whereas nations with the lowest carbon footprints generally possess few resources to do so (Ciplet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Harlan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>; Roberts &amp; Parks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2006</xref>). Locally, a similar pattern holds. In U.S. cities, poor neighborhoods such as the Lower East Side are typically more exposed to heat waves, more prone to catastrophic flooding, and more likely to experience morbidity and mortality during extreme events (de Sherbinin &amp; Bardy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>), even as residents in these neighborhoods are least responsible for urban carbon emissions (Rice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2019</xref>; Wachsmuth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>).</p>
