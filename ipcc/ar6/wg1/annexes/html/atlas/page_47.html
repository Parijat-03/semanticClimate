These 2 projections are supported by CMIP5 model results under different RCP scenarios. CMIP5 projections over 3 North Asia show that temperatures will rise more in boreal winter (DJF) than in boreal summer (JJA).  4 5 In North Asia, all CMIP5 models project an increase in precipitation in both the winter half year and summer 6 half year.

More 20 intense climate warming was observed in spring in East Siberia and over the Russian Far East, strengthening 21 from south to north territories with linear trend of 0.8&#176;C&#8211;1.2&#176;C per decade for the 1976&#8211;2014 period (Frolov 22 et al., 2014; Ippolitov et al., 2014; Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015). Trends of annual averaged temperature 23 in the northern part of the region during the last decades were twice as strong as that averaged over the globe 24 (Frolov et al., 2014; Mokhov, 2015; Sherstyukov, 2016). This tendency has been accompanied by winter 25 cooling in mid-latitude regions and well-pronounced in Western and Eastern Siberia, especially in its 26 southern part (Cohen et al., 2014; Ippolitov et al., 2014; Gruza et al., 2015; Kharyutkina et al., 2016; 27 Overland et al., 2016; Perevedentsev et al., 2017; Wegmann et al., 2018). This phenomenon has been called 28 &#8216;warm Arctic &#8211; cold Eurasia (Siberia)&#8217; or WACE (WACS) &#8211; the appearance of a cold anomaly over Siberia 29 was observed in conjunction with warming over the Arctic region (see Section Atlas.5.9.2), in particular over 30 the Barents-Kara sea region, where the last 15 years warming trend is larger than 2.5&#176;C per decade (Outten 31 and Esau, 2012; Semenov et al., 2012; Overland et al., 2016; Semenov, 2016; Wegmann et al., 2018; 32 Meleshko et al., 2019; Susskind et al., 2019). While the temperature decrease is strongly correlated with the 33 Barents-Kara sea ice loss, recent studies by (Blackport et al., 2019; Clark and Lee, 2019) have shown that 34 both phenomena are caused by a midlatitude circulation variability. Negative temperature trends in winter in 35 Siberia were also observed in the whole troposphere for the 1981&#8211;2010 period based on radiosonde 36 observations (Komarov et al., 2010). However, the trend of winter temperature decrease has moderated in 37 recent years, from &#8211;0.6&#176;C per decade for the 1976&#8211;2012 period to &#8211;0.3&#176;C per decade for the 1976&#8211;2018 38 period (Frolov et al., 2014; ROSHYDROMET, 2019). Extremality of cold days has also strengthened in the 39 south of Siberia, but in general, the total number of days with frost became less and in spring the situation 40 was reversed. The tendency to warming extends over the whole Asian territory of Russia and reached values 41 of 1.2&#176;C per decade, compensating the cooling in winter (Frolov et al., 2014). Temperature trends and means 42 derived from reanalysis datasets (JRA-25, MERRA) correctly represented temperature variability shown in 43 observational data over the Asian territory of Russia for the 1976&#8211;2010 period (Loginov et al., 2014). 44 45 Precipitation increased over the whole territory with a mean trend of 0.8 mm/month per decade for Russia in 46 the 1976&#8211;2012 period (Frolov et al., 2014). The highest precipitation increase predominantly was observed 47 over some regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East with estimated trends of 5&#8211;15 mm per decade for the 48 1976&#8211;2014 period (Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015) or 5% per decade for the 1976&#8211;2018 period 49 (ROSHYDROMET, 2019), which is also seen in Figure Atlas.29:. Decreasing tendency was observed in the 50 centre of Western Siberia, in the north of Eastern Siberia, the Baikal and Transbaikal regions, the Amur 51 River region and Primorye territories. The highest decrease in annual precipitation sums was observed over 52 the southern and north-eastern part of the Russian Far East namely over the Kamchatka and the Chukchi 53 Peninsulas up to &#8211;20 mm per decade for the 1976&#8211;2014 period (Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015) or 15&#8211;20% 54 per decade for the 1976&#8211;2018 period (ROSHYDROMET, 2019). 55 </span></div></body></html>
