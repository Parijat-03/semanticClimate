Analysis of data on the occurrence of varied natural hazards from 1900 to 2019 has shown that tropical cyclones, riverine floods and droughts have increased significantly, and the impacts of these events on coastal communities are also severe and destructive. The UN&#8217;s average score for SDG Goal 14 (Life Under Water) for Asia was estimated as 46 among the scores of 40 nations, and the Ocean Health Biodiversity index was comparatively high (average 87.9); however, the indices show that more region-specific action plans are required to achieve the UN 2030 goal for Life Under Water.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.1" top="474.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="474.63" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.98; y0: 474.63; y1: 484.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Apart from the human impacts, the ecology and resource abundance of coastal waters have been found to be impacted by extreme events.

For seagrass beds the pollution stress was found to increase by 2.6% (from 39.7 to 42.3%) when climate factors were added. Assuming the pollution levels remain at the 2014 levels, different scenarios including RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 were worked out for the Bohai Sea, and the results indicated amplification of the impacts on the ecosystem. Pollutants like petroleum hydrocarbons, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus were the major pollution stressors (Lu et&#160;al., 2018). In the future, policies that focus strictly on pollution control should be changed and take into account the interactive effects of climate change for better forecast and management of potential ecological risks (Lu et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.1" top="66.62"><span x0="42.52" y0="66.62" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.09; y0: 66.62; y1: 76.12; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Projected changes in catch potential (in percent) by 2050 and 2100 relative to 2000 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, based on outputs from </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.16" top="714.63"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.63" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 309.2; y0: 714.63; y1: 724.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">food-web models, indicate that the marine and coastal resources of most Asian countries will be impacted with varying intensity (FAO, 2018b).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.15" top="666.63"><span x0="306.56" y0="666.63" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.49; y0: 666.63; y1: 676.13; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Better management of resources through projections of resource distribution, abundance and catch is required; however, lack of data (e.g., oceanographic surveys) and scientific knowledge is a constraint to this aim (Maung Saw Htoo et&#160;al., 2017).

Likelihood of reduced catch was observed, and Bahrain and Iran were found to be more vulnerable to climate change (Wabnitz et&#160;al., 2018). Projected changes in fish catches can impact the supply of fish available for local consumption (i.e., food security) and exports (i.e., income generation) (Wabnitz et&#160;al., 2018). As per (UNESCAP, 2018a), over 40% of coral reefs and 60% of coastal mangroves in the Asia-Pacific region have already been lost, and approximately 80% of the region&#8217;s coral reefs are currently at risk.</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.17" top="426.66"><span x0="306.56" y0="426.66" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.49; y0: 426.66; y1: 436.16; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regionally, the escalation in thermal stress estimated for the different global warming scenarios is greatest for Southeast Asia and least for the Pacific Ocean (Lough et&#160;al., 2018).

Modelling results indicate that even under RCP scenarios, the functional traits of coral reefs can be affected (van der Zande et&#160;al., 2020) and coral communities will mainly consist of small numbers of temperature-tolerant and fast-growing species (Kubicek et&#160;al., 2019).

In the southern Persian Gulf, increased disturbance frequency and severity has caused progressive reduction in coral size, cover and population fecundity (Riegl et&#160;al., 2018), and this can lead to functional extinction. Connectivity required to avoid extinctions has increased exponentially with disturbance frequency and correlation of disturbances across the metapopulation.
