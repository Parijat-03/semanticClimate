<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0600">As vaccination efforts further progress, the spread of COVID-19 will hopefully be contained and countries will be able to reset their economies in the near future. But returning to previous paradigms would not make us immune to the risk of future pandemics arising from the spillover events of zoonotic diseases facilitated by wildlife consumption and trade, land use change, and environmental degradation. In a world under changing climate, food and nutritional security are projected to get under further pressure (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>). Hence the rapid transition toward sustainable food systems is essential for averting risks to and emerging from the agriculture and food sectors. The economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainable food systems need to be anchored in a strengthened focus on resilience, centered upon serving the most vulnerable. The recovery process represents a unique opportunity to do so.</p>
