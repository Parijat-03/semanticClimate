<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">An equilibrium climate experiment is a <em>climate model</em> experiment in which the model is allowed to fully adjust to a change in <em>radiative forcing</em>.</p>
<p>Such experiments provide information on the difference between the initial and final states of the model, but not on the time-dependent response. If the forcing is allowed to evolve gradually according to a prescribed <em>emissions scenario</em>, the time-dependent response of a climate model may be analysed. Such an experiment is called a transient climate experiment.</p>
