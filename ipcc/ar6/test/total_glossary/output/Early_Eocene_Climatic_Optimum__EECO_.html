<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The EECO is a period of geological time that occurred about 53 to 49 million years ago, during the Eocene Epoch. Continental positions at this time were somewhat different to present due to tectonic plate movements. Geological data indicate that the EECO was a period of relatively high atmospheric CO2 concentrations (about 1150â2500 ppmv) and relative warmth (<em>global mean surface temperature</em> was about 10â18 Â°C above the 1850â1900 reference), and polar <em>ice sheets</em> were absent.</p></dd>
