A Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of 82 mld capacity was constructed at Okhla. By 1956, the capacity of this plant was augmented to 164 mld. Additional STPs were later constructed at coronation pillar (55 MLD) and at Keshopur (55 MLD) in 1957 and 1960 respectively. The treatment capacity increased from 273 MLD in 1961 to 1,273 MLD in 1993. The present sewage treatment capacity in Delhi stands at around 2,330 MLD. Presently, the urban area of Delhi is served by a  gravity collection sewerage system involving a large network of branch sewers, intercepting  sewers, peripheral and trunk sewers, of about 6,000 km length. As per DJB there are 28 main trunk sewers with size ranging from 700 mm to over 2,400 mm diameter with a total length of around 140 km.  </span></div><div left="90.02" right="490.42" top="585.6"><span x0="90.02" y0="585.6" x1="490.42" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 98.03; y0: 585.6; y1: 597.6; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Table 20: Electricity Consumption of water pumping/treatment plans (ekWh) </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.28" top="276.46"><span x0="72.02" y0="276.46" x1="508.28" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 83.35; y0: 276.46; y1: 288.46; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">While the balance length comprises peripheral sewers with smaller diameter that form the linkage between trunk sewers and the smaller internal sewers in colonies with the smallest internal sewers having diameter of 150 mm. There are 36 major pumping stations of capacities ranging from 6 MLD to 455 MLD. In the past the emphasis was for the provision of drinking water supply only to both urban &amp; rural areas. As a result, growth in sewerage facilities has not been commensurate with the sewage generation. Even today, only about 60% of the population of Delhi is served by the sewerage system. For the purposes of sewerage and drainage, Delhi can be divided into six zones 1) Rithala, 2) Coronation Pillar 3) Keshopur 4) Okhla 5) Trans Yamuna and 6) Outer Delhi. Besides this, there are newly developed areas or urban extensions mostly contiguous with urban limits such as Narela, Pappan Kalan, Nazafgarh, Ghitroni, Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli &amp; Sarita Vihar. At present STPs are located at 17 different places in Delhi with a cumulative treatment capacity of 2,330 MLD (512.5 MGD). </span></div><div left="77.66" right="189.59" top="533.0"><span x0="77.66" y0="533.0" x1="189.59" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 84.86; y0: 533.0; y1: 542.96; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Name of Water Pumping/ Treatment Plant Electricity Consumption on water treatment/pumping (ekWh) 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2016-17 </span><span x0="77.66" y0="505.76" x1="188.14" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 505.76; y1: 515.72; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">120 mgd Wazirabad Water Works 5,86,39,396 5,81,73,432 5,87,66,928 5,57,08,592 4,76,30,850 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="367.38" top="478.88"><span x0="77.66" y0="478.88" x1="367.38" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 478.88; y1: 488.84; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">200 mgd Haiderpur 6,19,60,980 6,19,39,206 6,17,98,740 6,77,38,260 5,64,18,180 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="180.44" top="451.88"><span x0="77.66" y0="451.88" x1="180.44" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 451.88; y1: 461.84; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">20+6 MGD Okhla Water Works 68,21,282 72,48,840 75,29,084 66,33,380 95,01,820 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="169.79" top="424.98"><span x0="77.66" y0="424.98" x1="169.79" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 424.98; y1: 434.94; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">140 MGD WTP Sonia Vihar  1,89,79,380 4,06,61,340 53,5,51,050 5,07,63,600 4,99,04,010 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="367.38" top="397.98"><span x0="77.66" y0="397.98" x1="367.38" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 397.98; y1: 407.94; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">90 MGD Chandrawal WTP  2,91,22,959 2,84,95,0,141 2,70,47,130 2,81,22,264 2,79,65,965 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="487.51" top="371.1"><span x0="77.66" y0="371.1" x1="487.51" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 371.1; y1: 381.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">100 mgd Bhagirathi     2,22,20,790 </span></div><div left="77.66" right="487.51" top="347.34"><span x0="77.66" y0="347.34" x1="487.51" style="x0: 77.66; x1: 82.64; y0: 347.34; y1: 357.3; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">40 mgd Nangloi 88,74,720 82,48,000 82,98,000 94,36,900 1,84,86,808 20 mgd Bawana --- --- --- --- 40,58,790 50 mgd Dwarka --- --- --- --- 1,31,38,194 1 mgd CWG Village --- --- --- --- 5,65,046 Total     24,98,90,453 </span></div></body></html>
