However, this trend cannot be considered as a long-term one 5 because of the high multidecadal variability (William Landsea, 2015). For the northeast Pacific cyclogenetic 6 region, no significant trends in intense TCs have been found (Walsh et al., 2016), but interdecadal variability 7 in TC occurrence over the Pacific coast of Mexico is very important and is likely to be related to the PDO 8 (Raga et al., 2012; Pazos and Mendoza, 2013). The variation of TC intensity in the region is affected by the 9 detected poleward migration trend of the location of the moment of maximum intensity of TCs (Kossin et al., 10 2014).  11 12 13 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.4; y0: 608.27; y1: 619.25; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="608.27" x1="273.3">Atlas.5.5.1.3 Assessment of model performance </span><span x0="27.66" y0="608.27" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 608.27; y1: 619.25; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">14 The ability of climate models to simulate the climate in this region has improved in many key aspects 15 (Karmalkar et al., 2013; Fuentes-Franco et al., 2014, 2015, 2017; Vichot-Llano et al., 2014; Vichot-Llano 16 and Mart&#237;nez-Castro, 2017; Mart&#237;nez-Castro et al., 2018). Particularly relevant for this region are increased 17 model resolution and a better representation of the land-surface processes. 18 19 Regional climate models (RCMs) forced with a reanalysis product and atmosphere-only global climate 20 model (AGCM) provide time-slice simulations with a reasonably good performance over the core Mexican 21 monsoon and southwest United States regions (Bukovsky et al., 2013).

The PRECIS model 24 is also skilful at reproducing the observed temperature trends in the whole region, but it has problems 25 reproducing trends of precipitation in the tropical parts of the domain, underestimating precipitation 26 (Karmalkar et al., 2013; Centella-Artola et al., 2015). The simulated rainfall climatology of the central 27 Caribbean basin captures the bimodal characteristics of rainfall in the Caribbean, southern Mexico and part 28 of the Central America isthmus (Cavazos et al., 2019) though overestimating the late season peak rainfall 29 and displacing the rainfall maximum to November. The placement of the November-December-January 30 rainfall maximum south of Jamaica is interesting and suggests that the model may be over- or 31 underestimating the strength of the CLLJ.

Recent results show that the RCA4 model (Samuelsson et al., 2011) also reproduces well climate 35 patterns and features in the region (Cavazos et al., 2019). Using CORDEX output, Cerezo-Mota et al. (2015) 36 evaluated the capability of four RCMs &#8211; RCA 3.5 (Samuelsson et al., 2011), HadGem3-RA (Hewitt et al., 37 2011), REMO (Jacob, 2001) and RegCM4 &#8211;, using ERA-Interim as driving data, to reproduce the climate of 38 the North American Monsoon region, including the northern part of Mexico. They especially analysed two 39 years of extremely low and high precipitation within the period of simulations, with good results in the 40 reproduction of the key climatic features of the region. Cabos et al. (2018) applied the ROM oceanic model 41 (Sein et al., 2015) coupled with the REMO model to the Central America isthmus and Mexico to simulate 42 the climate in the region, showing improvements in the reproduction of the onshore and offshore 43 precipitation and of regional climate features such as the MSD and CLLJ. The PRECIS model also showed 44 skill in reproducing the observed negative trends in consecutive wet days (CWD) and negative trends in 45 extreme rainfall events (R95p) over the Caribbean, as other extreme precipitation and temperature indexes, 46 including their correct regional distribution (McLean et al., 2015). 47 48 About RegCM4, there is </span><span style="x0: 167.64; x1: 173.13; y0: 164.63; y1: 175.61; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="167.64" y0="164.63" x1="240.28">high confidence </span><span x0="240.3" y0="164.63" x1="41.45" style="x0: 240.3; x1: 243.36; y0: 164.63; y1: 175.61; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">that the model provides consistent reproductions of the main 49 climate features of the region, for horizontal resolutions of 50 and 25 km and different combinations of 50 physical parameterizations (</span><span style="x0: 180.72; x1: 184.99; y0: 139.37; y1: 150.35; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="180.72" y0="139.37" x1="253.68">robust evidence)</span><span x0="253.68" y0="139.37" x1="41.45" style="x0: 253.68; x1: 256.43; y0: 139.37; y1: 150.35; width: 2.74; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">, including climatic features such as the MSD and CLLJ 51 (Mart&#237;nez-Castro et al., 2006, 2016, 2018; Diro et al., 2012; Vichot-Llano et al., 2014). 52 53 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.63; y0: 101.33; y1: 112.31; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="101.33" x1="322.21">Representation of tropical cyclones in numerical models </span><span x0="27.66" y0="101.33" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 101.33; y1: 112.31; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">54 55 </span></div></body></html>
