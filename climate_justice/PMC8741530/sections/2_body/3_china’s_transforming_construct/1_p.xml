When China went into the first decade of 2000s, China&#8217;s then President Hu Jintao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>) still firmly insisted to represent China as a &#8216;major developing country&#8217; with &#8216;poor&#8217; and &#8216;underdeveloped&#8217; material capability and mainly positioned China as a &#8216;participant&#8217; in international affairs. Hu&#8217;s administration persistently opposed any suggestions for revising China&#8217;s developing country identity and rejected the idea of &#8216;G2&#8217; that the USA and China co-lead the world (Brzezinski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). In line with this developing country identity, China kept a low profile in international affairs (Men H&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>; Pu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).</p>
