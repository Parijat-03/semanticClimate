The vulnerability assessment and the climate action plan that is designed for the state can therefore serve as a model for other mega-cities in the country. In this vulnerability assessment therefore, fragile urban systems in the form of sectors are considered. This will ensure that the city/state (urban) nature of Delhi is well highlighted throughout this study.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.36" top="609.99"><span x0="72.02" y0="609.99" x1="526.36" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 609.99; y1: 621.99; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is a non-coastal city and therefore is not particularly affected by sea-level rise. It is however affected by the increasing number of hot days and the increase in intensity of rainfall that is projected for northern India as part of the PRECIS model that has been adopted for this study. These projections have shown that the annual temperature of Delhi is slated to increase by 1-4 degrees Celsius along with the intensity of rainfall by 2050. These changes in climate can lead to large scale damage to life and property in the years to come.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.01" top="502.8"><span x0="72.02" y0="502.8" x1="526.01" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 502.8; y1: 514.8; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is the capital of India and a state with one of India&#8217;s highest (of any other state) rate of growth of GDP. The formulation and implementation of a comprehensive climate change action plan is crucial to maintain this growth in GDP and the rising standards of living in the city. This climate change action plan can also serve to define a plan for sustainable development of the state of Delhi, through demand and supply side management of resource intensive activities. This would help Delhi maintain its economic robustness in the decades to come and help improve living conditions for large populations currently living in informal settlements, without adequate access to basic amenities. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.2" top="363.82"><span x0="72.02" y0="363.82" x1="526.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 363.82; y1: 375.82; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The actions recommended as part of this vulnerability assessment need to be well integrated into the city&#8217;s development strategy. This would help ensure efficient implementation of the climate action plan and that adequate funding is appropriated for these activities. Additionally, the plan can also be implemented in congruence with the eight missions described under the National Action Plan for Climate Change. This will help better integration of national and state level policies for combating the impacts of climate change. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="178.34" top="250.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="250.27" x1="178.34" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 250.27; y1: 262.27; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.1Methodology </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.04" top="222.67"><span x0="72.02" y0="222.67" x1="526.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 222.67; y1: 234.67; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Delhi vulnerability assessment was prepared for the Delhi government as part of Delhi&#8217;s State Action Plan for Climate Change.
