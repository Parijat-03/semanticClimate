At least in one region, a concrete example for responding to and translating the Paris Agreement in a transboundary mountain setting, is reported. In 2015, through policy measures afforded by the Alpine Convention for the European Alps, the ministers for the environment of the Alpine countries established the Alpine Climate Board, who at the XV Alpine Conference in April 2019, presented a climate target system that includes strategic targets for &#8216;climate-resilient Alps&#8217; (Hojesky et al., 2019). The implementation and monitoring of these initiatives, however, remains to be assessed on an evidentiary basis. Furthermore, mechanisms afforded through the workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism, speci&#64257;cally its work area under &#8216;Non-economic loss and damage&#8217;, are prospects relevant to address impacts to cultural and intrinsic values associated with losses in the high mountain cryosphere (UNFCCC Secretariat, 2014; Serdeczny, 2019).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="519.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.92; y0: 519.55; y1: 529.05; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="519.55" x1="307.58">Monitoring and reporting on progress towards sustainable development through the implementation of the SDGs (UN, 2015) is receiving some research attention in the context of mountain regions (Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Gratzer and Keeton, 2017; Bracher et al., 2018; Wymann von Dach et al., 2018; Kulonen et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2019), noting key mountain speci&#64257;c considerations to improve the conditions under which the SDGs may serve a purpose in the mountain context. For example, previous research has identi&#64257;ed a need for disaggregated data for SDG indicators and targets at subnational scales, with relevant area units that are both within country boundaries and/or across borders in transboundary settings (Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Bracher et al., 2018; Wymann von Dach et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the use of non-standardised proxy data can further limit the potential for comparisons between countries and within regions (Bracher et al., 2018; Kulonen et al., 2019). On substance, assessments of the economic performance of livelihood options, combined with robust socioeconomic data for mountain systems, are still lacking in many parts of the world, compromising the ability for meaningful comparison and aggregation of data and knowledge for monitoring and reporting on progress of SDGs at regional or global scales (Gratzer and Keeton, 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.56" top="255.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 255.58; y1: 265.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="255.58" x1="307.56">Disasters associated with natural hazards in high mountains are placing many communities and their potential for sustainable development at risk (Wymann von Dach et al., 2017; Keiler and Fuchs, 2018; Vaidya et al., 2019).

There are clear knowledge gaps in the distribution and characteristics of cryospheric variables, in particular the extent and ice content of permafrost in mountains, but also current glacier ice volumes, trends in lake and river ice, and the spatial and temporal variation of snow cover. These knowledge gaps persist despite a wealth of new data since AR5 especially from Earth observation satellites, which overcome much of the remoteness and inaccessibility of high mountains yet still face challenges for observations in mountains such as dealing with cloud cover and rugged terrain. Along with improved capacities to generate and&#160;integrate diverse observation data, initiatives such as citizen science (e.g.,&#160;Dickerson-Lange et al., 2016; Wikstrom Jones et al., 2018) or Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Section&#160;1.8.2, Cross Chapter Box&#160;4 in Chapter&#160;1) can also complement some observations that are based on conventional instruments and models. Radiative forcing effects of light absorbing particles, and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics, is a key knowledge gap for the attribution of changes in high mountain snow and glaciers, and the&#160;understanding of regional feedbacks (Section&#160;2.2.2,&#160;Box&#160;2.2).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="111.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 111.57; y1: 121.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="111.57" x1="566.12">These observational knowledge gaps currently impede efforts to quantify trends, and to calibrate and evaluate models that simulate the past and future evolution of the cryosphere and its impacts.
