The Paris Agreement Article 2.1c explicitly links achieving this goal with the level of financing. It also rightly linked the need for adaptation with the level of mitigation (Article 7.4). In view of this renewed focus on adaptation and its expansive governance space, agencies such as the World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, UNFCCC, the GEF, and GCF have the potential collectively to set new norms, including the expanded GPG framing of adaptation.</p>
