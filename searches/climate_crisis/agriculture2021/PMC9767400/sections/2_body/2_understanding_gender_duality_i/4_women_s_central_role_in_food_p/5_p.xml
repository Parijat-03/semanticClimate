Furthermore, as key players in food production and consumption, women's effective participation in agricultural activities is fundamental to the local food systems. As such, the current gender disparity in access to productive resources, markets and services in agriculture becomes a challenge to the sustainability and resilience of the food systems through which food security needs are met. Addressing gender inequality, particularly women's inability to access and control land and productive resources, is seen as a significant step towards enhancing food access and availability at the community and the household level.
