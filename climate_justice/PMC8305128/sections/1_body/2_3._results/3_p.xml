<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There is spatial coincidence between high average overcrowding (average 2.5 to 4.9 people per room&#8212;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>I) and incidence and mortality due to COVID-19, particularly in the south-central and the far northern Chilean communes. This spatial coincidence is also present when looking at the proportion of houses built before 2000, that is, before the implementation of the housing norm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>H); since they were built without thermal insulation requirements, they are more exposed to the cold and therefore need more heating, which in south and south-central Chile involves the use of firewood with the consequent impact on indoor pollution.</p>
