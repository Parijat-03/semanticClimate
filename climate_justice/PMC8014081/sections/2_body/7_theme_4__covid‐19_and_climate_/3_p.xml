The physical and social environment in which individuals, communities, and populations reside in the 21st century in the midst of the current pandemic and climate change are important to examine. Their recommendations are that current COVID&#8208;19 responses yield important efforts for future resilience designs in the built environment as well as frameworks and practices to address community health amidst climate change with lessons learned. Jin (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) described the importance of renewable energy research to address the intersection of climate change and COVID&#8208;19. The focus was on a message of <italic toggle="yes">we are all in this together and the time to act is now</italic>. Jin noted that &#8220;a pandemic and climate change are both existential challenges facing the whole human race who share this planet together. Neither Coronavirus nor climate see country borders&#8221; (p. 1709). Other key messages offered by Jin are <italic toggle="yes">that it is essential to act now before it is too late; that science and facts matter; that international collaboration is critical; and we must respect mother nature</italic>.</p>
