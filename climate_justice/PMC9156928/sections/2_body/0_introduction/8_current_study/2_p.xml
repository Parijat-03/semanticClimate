The aim of this study was not to test any particular theory, but rather to develop a novel methodology that clearly identifies which particular psychological factors may cause climate activism. To do this, we introduced two novel tools: (1) an intensive video intervention attempting to boost 11 psychological factors, and (2) a behaviour-tracking methodology to measure actual participation in Zoom activism events organized by two climate organizations.</p>
