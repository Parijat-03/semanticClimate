These include: (1) natural capital and ecosystem service restoration and resilience; (2) clean energy infrastructure; (3) efficiency-retrofits for buildings; (4) clean technology research and development; and (5) education and training to address COVID-19-related unemployment and decarbonisation shifts. The COVID-19 crisis has forced many businesses to increase adaptability given rapidly changing circumstances.<xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr"><sup>103</sup></xref> Governments can use this momentum to steer economies towards more sustainable, environmental, and human health-promoting futures. In addition to subsidy redirection, governments can take this opportunity to introduce new or strengthen existing carbon-trading and other regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector support of biodiversity and ecosystem health. Such initiatives could allow aid budgets to be allocated to biodiversity conservation (where compatible with poverty alleviation and development), provision of landholder payments for preserving ecosystem services, and increased tax benefits for landholders facilitating conservation through land covenants or easement.<xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr"><sup>92</sup></xref>
