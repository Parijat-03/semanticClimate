Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] used a difference-in-differences approach to benchmark companies&#8217; SBTs against their previous internal targets to assess whether SBT adoption leads to more ambitious targets. They found targeted percentage reduction in emissions to increase 21% to 25% on average after companies set an SBT, depending on target coverage (percent of emissions covered by the target). However, since Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] also found a strong positive correlation between targeted percentage reduction and timeframe (for all target-setting companies), it is not clear if the targeted reduction rate (reduction per year) increases after companies set an SBT. Given the voluntary nature of SBT adoption and the inability to use an experimental design that randomly assigns companies to internal target and SBT groups, the authors warn against concluding that SBT adoption causes increased ambition.</p>
