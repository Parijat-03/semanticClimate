We did not use subscription case law sources, including Westlaw, Thompson Reuters, and Lexis Nexus, RELX, as these databases are not open access and a costly subscription can limit access for prospective climate litigants especially in low-income countries. Perhaps, restricted access to legal sources exacerbates the problem of climate injustice, as it is a reality that those disproportionately impacted by climate change have least access to justice.</p>
