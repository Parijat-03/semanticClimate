<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Stadium or arena-anchored development projects remain an important part of urban redevelopment planning worldwide (Johnson and Whitehead, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Crompton, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Rosentraub, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It has been argued that urban redevelopment through sport stadium or arena projects results in both positive and negative outcomes for cities and their residents (Rosentraub, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Grant Long, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, while most attention is placed on the planning, scope, and construction of the new sports facility, less emphasis is on the facility or space left behind. <italic>Shadow stadia</italic> are vacated sites or venues such as arenas and stadiums once occupied by major professional or amateur sports franchises. When a facility is deemed obsolete by a team and its owners, it is effectively at the end of its lifecycle. When claiming obsolescence, team owners may decry the building unsafe or unfit (Unger, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Holstege, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), that their revenue expectations are not being met (Shapiro et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), or the facility is lacking modern upgrades to maintain it as a state-of-the-art facility (deMause, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
