<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0075">Fifth, a social green approach sees planetary degradation as inseparable from questions of social, economic, and political inequalities. This approach attributes both environmental degradation and poverty to the effects of large-scale industrialism, corporate control of the economy and hegemonic globalization of the ideologies of capitalism and consumption. In this approach, considerations of justice are often central. The focus is, for instance, on the protection and promotion of local economies, including through fair trade and targeted funding. Equally important is a focus on the restitution of land and resource rights of indigenous peoples and other rural communities, as reflected in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas (UNDROP). UNDROP promises to make important headways toward the pursuit of justice for the world's poor and marginalized communities that depend on environmental resources. In this sense, this approach offers crucial elements of a progressive strategy for planetary justice. Even so, the social green approach to planetary justice fails to address critical challenges. First, the significant faith that social greens place in decentralization and localization does not address the potential for local tyrannies and participatory exclusions (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ostrom, 2010</xref>) and the challenges that the poor and marginalized groups may face within decentralized and localized interventions. Second, social greens' advocacy of structural reforms at various levels is necessary but not enough. Pro-poor planetary justice would require proactive structural interventions at both local and global levels, meant to empower poor people to benefit from and partake in governing environmental transformations.</p>
