Procreative parenting can be conceptualized as a capability that is not only valuable but also incommensurable with any other capability. From this perspective, people do not want to have a child in the same way that they want to travel or engage in a hobby: rather, they want to have a child because they want to be a mother or a father&#8212;to be the person to whom a child goes if the child falls and gets hurt and needs to be comforted. In many peoples&#8217; lives, children are both the givers and the receivers of the most intense love. Those who want children because they value the capability of parenting want them because of the unique relationship that they expect children will give them: a relationship that is characterized by a unique emotional intensity, and generally also by unconditional love when they are young, and a deep love respecting the person they are becoming when they grow up.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn26">26</xref> This relationship is also unique in its relation to the dependency of one person (the child) on the other person (the parent), which is complete at birth but decreases as the child develops. In addition, parenthood changes and matures one&#8217;s identity: being a mother or a father has implications for various domains of one&#8217;s life and drastically changes one&#8217;s priorities, the structure of one&#8217;s freedoms, and one&#8217;s responsibilities. Procreating and raising children thus provides a unique window onto life; it is an existential experience that is not experientially commensurable with other experiences.</p>
