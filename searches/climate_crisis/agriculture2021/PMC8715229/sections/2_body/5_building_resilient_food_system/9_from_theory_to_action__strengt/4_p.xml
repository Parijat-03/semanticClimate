<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0570">With climate change under way, advancing technologies that improve the productivity and diversity of traits of crops and livestock will need to be a key component to adapting to changing environmental conditions. The environmental, socioeconomic, and ethical implications of the technological possibilities and advances need to be carefully assessed and balanced with efforts to identify and upscale available sustainable land management practices that help to protect and sustain the environment. Scenario planning exercises, integrated assessments, and other modeling and methodological tools can help better understand the long-term consequences of strategic choices (<xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">OECD and IIASA, 2020</xref>), as long as underlying assumptions are clearly communicated, and data and information are transparent.</p>
