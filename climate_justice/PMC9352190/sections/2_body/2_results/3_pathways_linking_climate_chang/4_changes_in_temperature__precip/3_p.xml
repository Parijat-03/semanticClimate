Studies suggest that an increase in surface water temperature causes dissolved oxygen levels to drop, phosphate levels to rise, and phytoplankton growth surges to occur, all leading to compromised water quality <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50334" id="interref0007">[</ext-link>

Meanwhile, increases in either the amount or frequency of precipitation also leads to soil degradation <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The capacity of soil to absorb nutrients, pesticides, and other substances is thereby reduced, which ultimately degrades water quality as well <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
