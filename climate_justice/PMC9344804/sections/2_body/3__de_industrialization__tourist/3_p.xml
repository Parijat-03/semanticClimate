In the nineteenth century, the railway and the port enabled the establishment of industries, which remained mainly at the margins of the island and in vicinity to traffic connections (Mancuso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>: 68), such as the area where the <italic>Stazione Marittima</italic> is located. This former industrial hub today features cruise terminals. To meet growing demand, the Italian government and local politicians started the construction of Marghera on the other side of the lagoon in 1917. This structural transformation led to the relocation of industry from island to mainland. A&#160;leading figure in the touristification of Venice was Giuseppe Volpi, who pursued his interests as an industrial entrepreneur, hotelier, and Fascist minister. After 1950, the petrochemical sector became especially important for the development of Marghera. Since the late 1960s, disputes concerning dangerous work conditions and environmental degradation have reinforced the ongoing struggle between safeguarding the historical center on the one hand and expanding industrial development on the other (Zazzara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>). During the industrial crisis of the 1970s, politics shifted direction, and the island&#8217;s value as a&#160;tourist destination was rediscovered (Petri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1988</xref>: 112). This led to a&#160;politically and economically driven deindustrialization and touristification of the island, which took place at the expense of the environment and the residents, and which continues to influence the area to this day.</p>
