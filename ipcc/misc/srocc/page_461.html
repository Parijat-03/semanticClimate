However, it focused primarily on food production systems due to the prevalence of studies on that topic (Porter et al. 2017). It highlighted that a&#160;range of potential adaptation options exist across all food system activities, not just in food production, and that bene&#64257;ts from potential innovations in food processing, packaging, transport, storage, and trade were insuf&#64257;ciently researched at that time. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="555.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 555.54; y1: 565.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="555.54" x1="313.26">The IPCC WG III AR5 chapter on Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) (Smith et al. 2014) assessed mitigation potential considering not only the supply, but also the demand side of land uses, by consideration of changes in diets; it also included food loss and waste. AR5 focused on crop and livestock activities within the farm gate and land use and land-use change dynamics associated with agriculture. It did not take a&#160;full food system approach to emissions estimates that include processing, transport, storage, and retail.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.56" x1="313.22">The IPCC WG II AR5 Rural Areas chapter (Revi et al. 2014) found that farm households in developing countries are vulnerable to climate change due to socio-economic characteristics and non-climate stressors, as well as climate risks (Dasgupta et al. 2014). They also found that a&#160;wide range of on-farm and off-farm climate change adaptation measures are already being implemented and that the local social and cultural context played a&#160;prominent role in the success or failure of different adaptation strategies for food security, such as trade, irrigation or diversi&#64257;cation. The IPCC WG II AR5 Urban Areas chapter found that food security for people living in cities was severely affected by climate change through reduced supplies, including urban-produced food, and impacts on infrastructure, as well as a&#160;lack of access to food. Poor urban dwellers are more vulnerable to rapid changes of food prices due to climate change.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="267.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.59; y0: 267.57; y1: 277.07; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="267.57" x1="313.24">Many climate change response options in IPCC WG II and WG III AR5 (IPCC 2014b) address incremental adaptation or mitigation responses separately rather than being inclusive of more systemic or transformational changes in multiple food systems that are large-scale, in depth, and rapid, requiring social, technological, organisational and system responses (Rosenzweig and Solecki 2018; Mapfumo et al. 2017; Termeer et al. 2017). In many cases, transformational change will require integration of resilience and mitigation across all parts of the food system including production, supply chains, social aspects, and dietary choices. Further, these transformational changes in the food system need to encompass linkages to ameliorative responses to land degradation (Chapter&#160;4), deserti&#64257;cation (Chapter&#160;3), and declines in quality and quantity of water resources throughout the food-energy-water nexus (Chapter&#160;2&#160;and Section&#160;5.7). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="87.6"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 87.6; y1: 97.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="87.6" x1="313.24">The IPCC Special Report on global warming of&#160;1.5&#176;C found that climate-related risks to food security are projected to increase with global warming of&#160;1.5&#176;C and increase further with 2&#176;C (IPCC 2018a). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="509.06" top="735.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 735.42; y1: 745.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.42" x1="509.06">1.1.4.2 Food systems and the Paris Agreement</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.79" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="711.52" x1="571.79">To reach the temperature goal put forward in the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to well below 2&#176;C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to&#160;1.5&#176;C, representatives from 196 countries signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) in December 2015. The Agreement put forward a&#160;temperature target of limiting warming to well below 2&#176;C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to&#160;1.5&#176;C.

Richards et al. (2015) analysed 160 Party submissions and found that 103 include agricultural mitigation; of the 113 Parties that include adaptation in their NDCs, almost all (102) include agriculture among their adaptation priorities. There is much attention to conventional agricultural practices that can be climate-smart and sustainable (e.g.,&#160;crop and livestock management), but less to the enabling services that can facilitate uptake (e.g.,&#160;climate information services, insurance, credit). Considerable &#64257;nance is needed for agricultural adaptation and mitigation by the least developed countries&#160;&#8211; in the order of 3&#160;billion USD annually for adaptation and 2&#160;billion USD annually for mitigation, which may be an underestimate due to a&#160;small sample size (Richards et al. 2015). On the mitigation side, none of the largest agricultural emitters included sector-speci&#64257;c contributions from the agriculture sector in their NDCs, but most included agriculture in their economy-wide targets (Richards et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="453.72" top="315.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.0; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 5.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="315.57" x1="453.72">Carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</span><span style="x0: 453.71; x1: 455.99; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="453.71" y0="315.57" x1="458.27">. </span><span style="x0: 460.9; x1: 466.35; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="460.9" y0="315.57" x1="571.77">A&#160;key aspect regarding the implementation of measures to achieve the Paris Agreement goals involves measures related to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) through bioenergy (Sections&#160;5.5 and&#160;5.6).
