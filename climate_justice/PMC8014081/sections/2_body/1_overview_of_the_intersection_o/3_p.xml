<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As discussed by Schwartz (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), the intersection of climate change and COVID&#8208;19 has emerged as the most complex and threatening public health challenge ever encountered&#8212;surpassing the Influenza Pandemic that emerged in 1918 when environmental degradation had not yet accelerated. Further Schwartz suggests: <disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="phn12866-blkfxd-0002"><p>The question that haunts my mind is, how would the United States handle such a pandemic outbreak if it occurred as the coronavirus did in China, just as some kind of major climate change crisis was also stressing the American healthcare system. Are we prepared? I don't think so, do you? The reality is that not only America but the world is utterly unprepared for these outbreaks, and when one adds the migrations that climate change will compel things look very bleak indeed (p. 141).</p></disp-quote>
