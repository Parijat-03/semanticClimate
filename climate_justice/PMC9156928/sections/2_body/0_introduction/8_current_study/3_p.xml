Although our review of the literature revealed more than a dozen possible psychological factors, we settled on just 11. These both had the most correlational evidence with activism behaviour, and fit our intuitions as climate activists of being relevant. The main goal of our study was to see which psychological factors changed in response to the intervention and to identify which of those changes predict shifts in behaviour. The main measure of activism behaviour in this study was event participation (objectively recorded). We embedded a study team member in the UCSD Green New Deal and SD350 climate groups and verified participation in events held by both organizations. Additionally, self-reported environmental education and leadership behaviour was collected, along with other pro-environmental behaviours relevant to climate change. Finally, a semi-structured interview based on the confirmatory results provided qualitative data about activists' own experiences and perceived barriers.
