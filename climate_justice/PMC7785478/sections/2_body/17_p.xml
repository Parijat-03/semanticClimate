Mann, IPCC author and Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State, responded, &#8220;Putting pressure on our elective representatives to act. We need to put a price on carbon and incentivize renewable energy to accelerate the transition underway from fossil fuels to green energy. But we cannot do that as individuals. Only our policymakers can do that. That means we must vote in politicians who favor action, vote out those who don&#8217;t, and put as much pressure as possible (in the form of activism, letter-writing, organizing, you name it) on our policymakers to act now&#8221; (Hagan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>).</p>
