Since then the wetlands&#8230; have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold.&#8221; (p. 71). Rush then discusses the current impact sea level rise is having on residents in south Florida, such as flooding caused simply by high tides, and projects those impacts into the future. Rush describes how discriminatory banking practices in the past, such as redlining, have made it difficult for low to middle-income cities (where the majority of citizens are people of color) to build and maintain strong property tax bases and provide basic services, much less mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
