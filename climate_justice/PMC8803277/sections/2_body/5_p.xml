Undoing the path dependency that global capitalism has put us on&#8212;one that has literally colonized the planet&#8212;requires that we direct focus on the inequitable distribution of power that, while global in reach, has been highly localized in function and consequence. That power, which coincides with the highest carbon-emitting nations of the world, has served to accumulate unsustainable wealth through the dispossession of the world&#8217;s poor from their own lands, resources, and traditions (Lee &amp; Masuda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>).</p>
