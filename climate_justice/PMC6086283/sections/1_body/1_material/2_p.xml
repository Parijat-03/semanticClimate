<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par10">The report <italic>Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</italic> is the result of a process that was launched in 2012 at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro. The member states agreed to develop a set of SDGs that should succeed the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) established in 2000. While the MDGs were mainly geared toward the developing countries, the SDGs apply for all nations. A 30-member Open Working Group (OWG) of the General Assembly was tasked with preparing a proposal for the sustainable development goals. The OWG was established on January 22, 2013. In a new representational mechanism, several countries shared most of the OWG seats. The outcome document of the Rio Conference <italic>The Future We Want</italic> stated that, at the outset, the OWG was to decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community, and the UN system in its work. The aim was to provide an integrated set of diverse perspectives and experience. On this basis, the intergovernmental negotiations were completed at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York (September 25&#8211;27, 2015) and the SDGs were adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
