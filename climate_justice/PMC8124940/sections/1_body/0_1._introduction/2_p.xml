<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">India is an especially useful context for examining climate injustice since a significant increase in mean temperature between 1986 and 2015 has been recorded [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (p. 22). Furthermore, several climate models project that heatwaves in India will occur earlier in the year, last longer, and increase in both frequency and intensity [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While prolonged exposure to temperatures above 35 &#176;C has the potential to exceed human adaptive capacity, the highest temperatures during heatwaves in India are likely to go well beyond this and reach around 50 &#176;C [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As population and built-up surface continue to expand in major urban areas in India [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], it becomes imperative to analyze whether socially vulnerable populations reside in areas exposed to higher levels of heat.</p>
