Similarly, Rutz and colleagues describe the opportunities for researchers to examine the impacts of COVID&#8208;19, climate change, and the effects of human activity. They described the <italic toggle="yes">great pause</italic> during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and critical importance of engaging in climate change action. In the sole research article found in this integrative review of the intersection of climate change and COVID&#8208;19, Li and colleagues (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) studied air quality changes during the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown in the Yangtze River Delta Region of China. They offered insight into the impact of human activity and air pollution and suggested that national lockdown policies in China resulted in significantly reduced air pollutant emissions with improved air quality. Furthermore, they found that human activities&#8212;which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution&#8212;were limited with a resulting improvement in climate change related impacts such as air quality.</p>
