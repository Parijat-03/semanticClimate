Relying on a single index to guide equity-oriented adaptation may be too restrictive. Complementing existing approaches is important to fully assess community vulnerability to extreme heat. Here we have considered ways to increase robustness in vulnerability screening through intersection of CES with other relevant indices. Previous work on social vulnerability indices has aimed to address measurement uncertainty and bias by varying aspects of index construction via Monte Carlo simulations to generate a &#8220;frequency distribution of social vulnerability ranks for each tract&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One study showed that a multiplex network analysis could be used to strengthen indicator selection by considering their relative weights, interdependencies, and interactions [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Another assessed and validated index design choices through a global sensitivity analysis [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Beyond quantitative checks, qualitative methods build robustness into community screening when conducting equity-oriented adaptation work. &#8220;Ground-truthing&#8221; and implementing community-based participatory research methods are essential complements and provide validity checks to data-based, quantitative representations of vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Other techniques such as case studies, expert elicitation, etc. can provide context-specific information and illuminate dynamics and hierarchical structures that might be over looked under quantitative approaches alone [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. CEJA&#8217;s report provides further recommendations for how to supplement and expand CalEnviroScreen specifically for different policy endeavors [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
