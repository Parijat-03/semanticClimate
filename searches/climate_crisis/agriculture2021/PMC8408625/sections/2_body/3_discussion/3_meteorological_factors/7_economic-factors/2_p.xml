<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0195">In terms of economic factors associated with WNV infections, higher GDP growth, higher spending, growth on environmental factors - such as agriculture, forest, fisheries - and waste water management are negatively associated with WNV incidence, consistently with concepts laid out in the conceptual framework. In other words, populations living in locations harder hit by economic slowdown and austerity could have been more exposed to mosquitoes, for instance drops in income make it difficult to afford mosquito repellents, air conditioning and upkeep of homes leading to the creation of mosquito habitats. General cuts to waste water management and hazard prevention efforts, such as spending on flood defenses, essential works like sanitation and upkeep of infrastructure, could have also led to the creation of mosquito breeding habitats, e.g. potholes, blocked drains <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, many studies report strong associations between agriculture <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and WNV incidence. In general, cuts and lower spending in this sector, may have led to degradation on farms and the wider environment which may have benefited mosquitoes through the creation of habitat or lack of measures to control their abundance. The literature is scarce on this topic which makes it very difficult to compare our findings with other sources of information, so our interpretations of such results can only be speculative.</p>
