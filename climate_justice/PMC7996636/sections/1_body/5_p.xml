<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Researchers and policymakers are also beginning to recognize the connection between climate change, pollution, environmental risks and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (<xref rid="czaa165-B11" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="czaa165-B2" ref-type="bibr">Campbell-Lendrum and Pr&#252;ss-Ust&#252;n, 2019</xref>); HPSR could help expand these understandings. Equipping health sector actors to become strong advocates on climate change is critical given the many linkages across determinants of health&#8212;clean air, safe drinking water, enough food and secure shelter (<xref rid="czaa165-B21" ref-type="bibr">Watts <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Until recently health has not featured prominently within the international climate change agenda (<xref rid="czaa165-B23" ref-type="bibr">Workman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="czaa165-B13" ref-type="bibr">Ossebaard and Lachman, 2020</xref>). HPSR can help the health sector contribute to improved governance developing coherent and sensitively designed, cross-sectoral policies and programmes, which could produce major co-benefits for people and planet (<xref rid="czaa165-B27" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). For example, multisectoral collaboration and action for health are critical, but capacities for multisectoral action for health are underdeveloped and limited (<xref rid="czaa165-B17" ref-type="bibr">Rasanathan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>); this is especially the case for climate change.</p>
