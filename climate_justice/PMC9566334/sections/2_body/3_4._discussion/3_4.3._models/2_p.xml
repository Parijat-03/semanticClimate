For example, the gentrification of a neighborhood with an influx of affluent White populations would not necessarily lower the SUHI intensity of the affected area unless there was an emphasis placed on greening [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This discussion is simply demonstrative of the trends and differences in thermal exposure, as measured by SUHI intensity, of the different demographic groups. Variations in Black population percentage have the strongest effect on the model suggesting a higher degree of inequitable thermal exposure among the urban Black population than all demographic groups examined. These results unequivocally support Hsu et al. [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and suggest their findings hold through time. Specifically that Black residents experience the highest average SUHI exposure, Hispanics the second highest and non-Hispanic Whites with the lowest degree of exposure [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The present observation for Asian populations also supports the findings of Jesdale et al., where Asian populations were more likely than the White population to live in more stressful thermal environments but less likely than the Black population [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, Jesdale et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found a lower probability for Hispanics to be in stressed thermal environments. Findings here contradict this observation and find Hispanics to be highly likely to reside in thermally extreme environments based on the prevalence categorization.</p>
