Between 2011 and 2019, the average reported scope 1 target (including internal targets, SBT commitments, and approved SBTs) increased from an 18.5 to a 30.5% reduction, but the average target timeframe also increased from 5 to 11&#160;years, indicating (as in Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]) a possible trade-off between targeted emission reduction and timeframe. They also found that companies tend to report a higher percentage emission reduction in the initial years after setting a target than in later years, with a higher initial reduction observed for companies setting internal targets than those committing to or setting an SBT. The difference between this finding and that of Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] (related to SBT impacts on investments) suggests that SBT commitments are less substantive than approved SBTs (since Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] group committed and approved SBTs together). Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] further found that companies with lower initial emissions tend to achieve larger percentage reductions and are more likely to further strengthen their commitments, which aligns with Freiberg et al.&#8217;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] finding that companies are more likely to set SBTs if they had set and achieved more ambitious internal targets.</p>
