Since 1991, farmers have provided labour for SWC in January as a free service for 20 consecutive working days, followed by food for work for the remaining days of the dry season. Most of the degraded landscapes have been restored, with positive impacts over the last two decades on soil fertility, water availability and crop productivity. However, misuse of fertilisers, low survival of tree seedlings and lack of income from exclosures may affect the sustainability of these land restoration measures (Gebremeskel et&#160;al. 2018).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="386.47" top="615.42"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.26; y0: 615.42; y1: 625.42; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="615.42" x1="386.47">B.

Extensive cattle ranching (limited mechanisation, low use of fertiliser and seed inputs) has led to pasture expansion, including clearing forests to secure properties rights, occurring mainly over 1950&#8211;1975 (Martha et&#160;al. 2012). Despite observed productivity gains made over the last three decades (Martha et&#160;al. 2012), more than half of the pasture area is degraded to some extent, and challenges remain to reverse grassland degradation while accommodating growing demand and simultaneously avoiding the conversion of natural habitats (de Oliveira Silva et&#160;al. 2018).

This initial intensi&#64257;cation era was partly at the expense of signi&#64257;cant uncontrolled deforestation, and average animal stocking rates remained well below the potential carrying capacity (Strassburg et&#160;al. 2014). Changes in land use are dif&#64257;cult to reverse since pasture abandonment does not lead to the spontaneous restoration of old-growth savannah (Cava et&#160;al. 2018); moreover, pasture to crop conversion is frequent, supporting close to half of cropland expansion in Mato Grosso state over 2000&#8211;2013 (Cohn et&#160;al. 2016). Pasture intensi&#64257;cation through liming, fertilisation and controlled grazing could increase soil organic carbon and reduce net GHG emission intensity per unit meat product, but only at increased investment cost per unit of area (de Oliveira Silva et&#160;al. 2017). Scenarios projecting a decoupling between deforestation and increased pasture intensi&#64257;cation, provide the basis for a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Brazil that is potentially consistent with accommodating an upward trend in livestock production to meet increasing demand (de Oliveira Silva et&#160;al. 2018). Deforestation in Brazil has declined signi&#64257;cantly between 2004 and 2014 in the national inventory, but recent data and analyses suggest that the decrease in&#160;deforestation and the resulting GHG emissions reductions have slowed down or even stopped (UNEP 2017).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="407.96" top="363.42"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.26; y0: 363.42; y1: 373.42; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="363.42" x1="407.96">C.

The importance of forest mitigation in Indonesia is indicated by the NDC, where between half and two-thirds of the 2030 emission target relative to a&#160;business-as-usual scenario is from reducing deforestation, forest degradation, peatland drainage and &#64257;res (Grassi et&#160;al. 2017). Avoiding deforestation and reforestation could have multiple co-bene&#64257;ts by improving biodiversity conservation and employment opportunities, while reducing illegal logging in protected areas. However, these options could also have adverse side effects if they deprive local communities of access to natural resources (Graham et&#160;al. 2017). The adoption of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certi&#64257;cation in oil palm plantations reduced deforestation rates by approximately 33% in the period 2001&#8211;2015 (co-bene&#64257;ts with mitigation), and &#64257;re rates much more than for non-certi&#64257;ed plantations (Carlson et&#160;al. 2018). However, given that large-scale oil palm plantations are one of the largest drivers of deforestation in Indonesia, objective information on the baseline trajectory for land clearance for oil palm is needed to further assess commitments, regulations and transparency in plantation development (Gaveau et&#160;al. 2016).
