<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0270">Ultimately, if courtroom ethnography offers avenues for challenging &#8220;petroleum colonization&#8221; (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Valdivia, 2008</xref>) and de-centring the logics of settler-colonial laws through alternatives voices, dilemmas thus also emerge. Critical attention will be needed in the years ahead on legal geographies, social movements and changing political ecologies of ongoing climate disaster. But writing about setter-colonial courtroom proceedings requires commitment to epistemologies of difference and ontologies of care that are already subordinated by Eurocentric &#8216;justice&#8217; systems. <italic>Starting</italic> with a settler-colonial courtroom space, even if showing its own inconsistencies and violence, risks mirroring its form and further denying agency to spaces of Indigenous law as the rightful starting points of the conversation. Methodological lesson-learning during the process of courtroom ethnography underscores the importance of building relations that transcend courtroom milieus, exploring a myriad of histories, solidarities, and forms of expression that give meaning to value systems that link social and ecological justice, destabilizing assumptions about legal contestation, civil disobedience and jurisdictional authority. Now, in the midst of a resurgence of Indigenous legal scholarship, political geography as a field needs urgently to heed calls for engaging Indigenous values and law more centrally, to better understand struggles faced in land and water protection, to disrupt ongoing colonial violence, and to guide fundamentally different visions for &#8216;climate justice&#8217; and the spatial politics of the future.</p>
