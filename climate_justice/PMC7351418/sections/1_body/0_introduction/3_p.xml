<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0010">In the United States, the Obama Administration addressed the issue of potential job and revenue losses in its&#160;POWER&#160;+&#160;Plan several years ago. A 2019 Bill in Colorado, HB19-1314, created a new institution called the &#8220;Just Transition Office&#8221; within the Department of Labor and Employment. While its focus is in coal plant and mine closures, the institutional framework could be applied in the future to other aspects of the energy transition <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Present challenges including the 2020 oil crash and the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated job losses in other parts of the energy sector, especially in oil and gas <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Whether these will remain permanent features of the energy landscape is not clear, but some level of consolidation and job loss was occurring prior to the virus&#8217; spread <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The need for a &#8220;just transition,&#8221; a managed shift toward a low-carbon energy system that prioritizes secure, family-sustaining jobs and healthy communities, is urgent given emergent risk multipliers for those on the front lines of a shifting energy and labor landscape. We consider the roots of the notion of just transitions as they grew out of labor and environmental justice movements and examine existing institutions, processes, and policy initiatives that presently support the implementation of a just transition.</p>
