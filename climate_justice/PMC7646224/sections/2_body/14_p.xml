Although the carbon tax was accompanied by some minor increases in welfare payments intended to offset its impact, the public largely rejected the tax perceiving it as an effort to kill jobs and further disempower the working class (Mercer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). Within 2&#160;years of the carbon price being enacted, the Liberal&#8211;National Coalition opposed the incumbent party responsible for the tax and ran on a platform to &#8216;axe the tax&#8217;. The anti-tax coalition decisively won. The whole debacle&#8212;rooted in a flawed and siloed approach to climate policy&#8212;ultimately proved politically costly and setback the climate movement in Australia for decades.</p>
