presentations on the science of climate change and the gaps in climate change
education and communication in the health professions (see <xref rid="table1-23821205211061019" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The second
week connected climate change to human health outcomes, including global
warming, extreme heat, and vulnerable populations. Weeks 3 through 7 addressed
air quality, excessive precipitation, water- and vector-borne disease, mental
health, extreme weather events, and disaster preparedness. Week 8 focused on the
importance of climate communication and future solutions, including health
professional advocacy and policy involvement. The rich contextual experience
offered in this introductory course followed the educational principles and
guidance provided by health and science, technology, engineering and math educators.<sup>
