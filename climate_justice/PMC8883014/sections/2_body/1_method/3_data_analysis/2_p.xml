The analysis was exploratory, and so we adopted an inductive approach focusing on what was meaningful to participants about climate change rather than exploring their accounts through a specific theoretical lens. We used reflexive thematic analysis to develop rich experiential themes that could capture latent features of the data and offer nuanced insights into participants&#8217; subjective experiences. Following Braun and Clarke&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>) six-stage process, we familiarized ourselves with the dataset, and then developed initial codes and themes, using half the accounts. We reviewed these themes against the data, and then analyzed the remaining half of the open comments, reviewing and developing themes throughout. All findings presented below provide theoretical sufficiency (i.e., reaching a sufficient depth of understanding for the researcher to build a theory, and have been reviewed against the data to ensure their redundancy (i.e., that they reflect the views of several participants). One author (LB) undertook analysis and engaged in regular debriefing with others in the research group (SS, SC, SL).</p>
