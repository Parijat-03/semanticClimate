<p>In the contemporary socio-geopolitical environment, there is impetus to innovate and adapt
pedagogical practices. Social work educators are seeking to empower a new generation of
practitioners who are adaptable to changing conditions and circumstances and are critical
thinkers, capable of practical action in disrupted times. This paper focuses on social work
knowledge, practice and pedagogies to explore some new spaces, and on opportunities as well as
constraints in preparing social work students for the contemporary practice context. The link
between social justice and environmental and community sustainability is a central theme and
connects to developments in social work education internationally (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Beltr&#225;n, Hacker and Begun, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulos, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Naranjo, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Ranta-Tyrkk&#246; and N&#228;rhi, 2021</xref>). We are in an
era of geopolitics and currently in the midst of new challenges as we face the repercussions of
a global pandemic and an impending climate emergency. Community development writers urge
immediate action to respond to these challenges drawing on a community development approach

educators have long argued that social workers play a crucial role in working with groups and
communities using fundamental practice principles of community empowerment and social and
environmental justice (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Forde and Lynch, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bay,
