      <td>Integrated water management is the process of\ncreating holistic strategies to promote integrated,\nefficient, equitable and sustainable use of water for\nagroecosystems. It includes a collection of practices\nincluding water-use efficiency and irrigation in arid/semi-\narid areas, improvement of soil health through increases\nin soil organic matter content, and improved cropland\nmanagement, agroforestry and conservation agriculture.\nIncreasing water availability, and reliability of water for\nagricultural production, can be achieved by using different\ntechniques of water harvesting, storage, and its judicious\nutilisation through farm ponds, dams, and community\ntanks in rainfed agriculture areas can benefit adaptation.</td>
      <td>These practices can reduce aquifer and surface\nwater depletion, and prevent over-extraction, and the\nmanagement of climate risks. Many technical innovations,\ne.g., precision water management, can have benefits for\nboth adaptation and mitigation, although trade-offs are\npossible. Maintaining the same level of yield through use\nof site-specific water management-based approach could\nhave benefits for both food security and mitigation.</td>

      <td>Forest management refers to management interventions\nin forests for the purpose of climate change mitigation.\nIt includes a wide variety of practices affecting the\ngrowth of trees and the biomass removed, including\nimproved regeneration (natural or artificial) and a better\nschedule, intensity and execution of operations (thinning,\nselective logging, final cut, reduced impact logging, etc.).\nSustainable forest management is the stewardship and\nuse of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that\nmaintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration\ncapacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and\nin the future, relevant ecological, economic and social\nfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that\ndoes not cause damage to other ecosystems.</td>
      <td>Sustainable forest management can enhance the carbon\nstock in biomass, dead organic matter, and soil &#8211; while\nproviding wood-based products to reduce emissions in\nother sectors through material and energy substitution.\nA trade-off exists between different management\nstrategies: higher harvest decreases the carbon in the\nforest biomass in the short term but increases the carbon\nin wood products and the potential for substitution effects.\nSustainable forest management, also through close-\nto-nature silvicultural techniques, can potentially offer\nmany co-benefits in terms of climate change mitigation,\nadaptation, biodiversity conservation, microclimatic\nregulation, soil erosion protection, coastal area protection\nand water and flood regulation. Forest management\nstrategies aimed at increasing the biomass stock levels\nmay have adverse side effects, such as decreasing the\nstand-level structural complexity, biodiversity and resilience\nto natural disasters. Forest management also affects albedo\nand evapotranspiration.</td>

The combination\nof reduced GHG emissions and biophysical effects results\nin a large climate mitigation effect, with benefits also at\nlocal level. Reduced deforestation preserves biodiversity\nand ecosystem services more efficiently and at lower\ncosts than afforestation/reforestation. Efforts to reduce\ndeforestation and forest degradation may have potential\nadverse side effects, for example, reducing availability of\nland for farming, restricting the rights and access of local\npeople to forest resources (e.g., firewood), or increasing the\ndependence of local people to insecure external funding.</td>

      <td>Reforestation is the conversion to forest of land that has\npreviously contained forests but that has been converted\nto some other use. Forest restoration refers to practices\naimed at regaining ecological integrity in a deforested\nor degraded forest landscape. As such, it could fall under\nreforestation if it were re-establishing trees where they\nhave been lost, or under forest management if it were\nrestoring forests where not all trees have been lost.\nFor practical reasons, here forest restoration is treated\ntogether with reforestation.</td>
      <td>Reforestation is similar to afforestation with respect\nto the co-benefits and adverse side effects among\nclimate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification,\nland degradation and food security (see row on Afforestation\nbelow). Forest restoration can increase terrestrial carbon\nstocks in deforested or degraded forest landscapes and can\noffer many co-benefits in terms of increased resilience of\nforests to climate change, enhanced connectivity between\nforest areas and conservation of biodiversity hotspots.\nForest restoration may threaten livelihoods and local\naccess to land if subsistence agriculture is targeted.</td>
