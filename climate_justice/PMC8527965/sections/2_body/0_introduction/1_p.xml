Human relationships with nature have transformed and amplified losses to biodiversity, ecosystem integrity, flora and fauna species, and land productivity. Human society is increasingly faced with the widespread impacts of anthropogenic climate change. While biophysical and social systems will continue to change and adjust to these stressors (Adger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>), barriers and limits to adaptation have emerged (Dow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; Spires et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014</xref>). As a consequence of reaching an &#8220;adaptation frontier&#8221; (Preston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>, p. 1011), whereby socio-ecological systems can no longer exist in a safe operating space before reaching a limit, loss and damage will continue to accelerate across &#8220;social and ecological domains&#8221; as a result of climate change (Barnett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>, p. 976). Climate change loss and damage is diverse and complex in nature and does not necessarily follow a linear and teleological script.</p>
