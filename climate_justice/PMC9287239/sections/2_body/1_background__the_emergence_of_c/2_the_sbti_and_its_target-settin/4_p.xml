Companies must set SBTs for scope 3 emissions if they account for at least&#160;40% of total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions (which is often the case), and the targets must cover at least two-thirds of scope 3 emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Companies can use target-setting methods other than the ACA and SDA methods (subject to certain constraints), and scope 3 targets are still allowed to align with a 2&#160;&#176;C scenario in addition to the well-below 2&#160;&#176;C or 1.5&#160;&#176;C scenarios. Companies may also set supplier or customer engagement targets instead of direct scope 3 emission reduction targets. With engagement targets, companies commit to motivating selected suppliers and customers to set SBTs for their scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p>
