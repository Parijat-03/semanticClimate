<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because California represents a large proportion of our sample and is distinct from the rest of the Southwest in terms of its climate and demographics, we examined a subset of the data representing California cities and compared it with data for the rest of the Southwest. We ran additional regression models that separated California neighborhoods from the rest of the sample. We found that California&#8217;s urban regions had much larger temperature differences between the wealthiest and poorest neighborhoods than regions in the rest of the Southwest. For extreme heat days, the poorest decile of California neighborhoods in each region were 2.6 &#176;C (4.7 &#176;F) hotter on average than the wealthiest decile neighborhoods, compared to a mean difference of 1.7 &#176;C (3.1 &#176;F) in other Southwestern urban areas. For average heat days, the mean difference was 2.5 &#176;C (4.5 &#176;F) in California metropolitan areas, compared with 2.1 &#176;C (3.8 &#176;F) in other southwestern cities. Nighttime thermal differences in California were 1.3 &#176;C (2.2 &#176;F) on average, compared to 1 &#176;C (1.8 &#176;F) for Southwestern urban regions outside the state.</p>
