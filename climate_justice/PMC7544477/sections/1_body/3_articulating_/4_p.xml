<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0205">Prosecutorial discourses here, in targeting land and water defenders, revolved around settler-colonial logics that assume the desirability of resource extraction; though unsurprising, the abrasive words were spectacularly incongruent to the demeanour of those being targeted. Prosecutors in early December 2018 aggressively stated &#8211; as if fact &#8211; that women elders showed &#8220;no concern for the community&#8221; when they stood on the road in Burnaby mountain to resist the pipeline expansion. The defendants were said by the prosecutors to have engaged in &#8220;excessive lawlessness&#8221;, &#8220;foolish bravery,&#8221; with &#8220;no concern for the impact of their actions on community resources.&#8221; Prosecutorial language here &#8211; apparently copy-and-pasted from other legal cases to show precedent in a colonial system that works precisely through logics of territorial and social de-contextualization &#8211; suggested that the words &#8220;community resources&#8221; and &#8220;concern&#8221; have no meanings besides those favouring an oil company's use of state resources to enforce an injunction. Using this jargon, the Crown prosecutor spent more than an hour detailing, uninterrupted, legal precedents on sentences, to ensure that no appeals could succeed.</p>
