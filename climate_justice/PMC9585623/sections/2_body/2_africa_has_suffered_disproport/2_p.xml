In 2018, devastating cyclones impacted 2.2 million people in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In west and central Africa, severe flooding resulted in mortality and forced migration from loss of shelter, cultivated land, and livestock (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Changes in vector ecology brought about by floods and damage to environmental hygiene have led to increases in diseases across sub&#8208;Saharan Africa, with rises in malaria, dengue fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Lyme disease, Ebola virus, West Nile virus and other infections (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Rising sea levels reduce water quality, leading to water&#8208;borne diseases, including diarrhoeal diseases, a leading cause of mortality in Africa (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Extreme weather damages water and food supply, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, which causes 1.7 million deaths annually in Africa (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, malnutrition has increased by almost 50% since 2012, owing to the central role agriculture plays in African economies (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Environmental shocks and their knock&#8208;on effects also cause severe harm to mental health (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In all, it is estimated that the climate crisis has destroyed a fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries most vulnerable to climate shocks (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
