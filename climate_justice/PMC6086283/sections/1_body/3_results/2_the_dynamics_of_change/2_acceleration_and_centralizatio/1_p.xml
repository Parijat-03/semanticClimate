<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par31">The UN documents focus on the implementation of the macro-level techno-scientific ideal of informational transparency on the meso-level. In the PA, implementation is seen as an &#8220;accelerating&#8221; (PA, 10.5) process. It can &#8220;mobilize&#8221;, &#8220;scale up&#8221;, &#8220;catalyze&#8221; and &#8220;increase&#8221; meso-level &#8220;climate actions&#8221;. These processes again depend on &#8220;collaborative approaches to research and development, and facilitating access to technology&#8221; (PA, 10.5). But the regulative &#8220;incentives&#8221; deriving from accelerative &#8220;mechanisms&#8221; refer exclusively to the meso-level national states as parties of the agreement (PA, 5). They do not relate to non-Party stakeholders&#8217; activism on the micro-level. Equally so, the accelerative pattern of implementation applies for the &#8220;follow-up and review framework&#8221; of the SDGs (SDGs, 36&#160;pp.) depending on a unique universal and &#8220;global indicator framework&#8221;. Therefore, this macro&#8211;meso process of SD can be considered a highly centralistic top-down control mechanism that is assumed to mechanically trickle down and accelerate even collective action on the micro-level.</p>
