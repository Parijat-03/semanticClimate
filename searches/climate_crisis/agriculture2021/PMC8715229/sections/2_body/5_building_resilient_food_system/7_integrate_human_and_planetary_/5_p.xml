The emphasis on nutritional security and human health has direct implications for the types of food crops that are grown, and the demand for livestock and aquaculture, which requires an alignment of thinking about land use management (<xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez, 2020</xref>). Sanchez notes that a global shift to the EAT Lancet healthy diet recommendations to meet the needs of 10 billion people by 2050 would demand less land than currently used by the agricultural sector. Other assessments and research initiatives have further highlighted the importance of healthy diets in reducing the pressure on soils and the environment and bending the curve on biodiversity loss (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Lecl&#232;re et al., 2020</xref>), illustrating the benefits of integrating human and planetary health concerns in food systems.</p>
