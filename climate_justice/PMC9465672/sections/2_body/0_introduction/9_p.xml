In the next section, we present the methodology. Then, we focus on the specific case of Djobel island, using a "people and pixels"&#160;approach (e.g., National Research Council, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1998</xref>) to the study of socio-environmental change to portray land use-cover changes (LUCC) and to call for an intervention that takes into account local knowledge, coping strategies and livelihoods, people's cosmological beliefs and religious practices, as well as their community identity and political structure (see also Brown et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Moreover, in a scholar-activist tradition and using Robinson's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010</xref>: 1) words, our aim is to "amplify the voices of those people who have done least to cause climate change, but who are affected most severely by it"</p>
