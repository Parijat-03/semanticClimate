This perspective argues that reality is subjective and that &#8220;truth&#8221; in social life is a construct reflecting our own experiences&#8212;historical, cultural, and experiential. In International Relations, constructivists emphasize a shift away from neoclassical, rationalist, and interest-based accounts to factor in the role of knowledge, norms, and values in shaping positions of nation-states, which are guided not just by material power, but also by discursive power and ideational elements (Haas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>).</p>
