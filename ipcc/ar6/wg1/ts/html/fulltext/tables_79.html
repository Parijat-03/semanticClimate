Climate services are\ngrowing rapidly and are highly diverse in their practices and products. The decision-making context, level of user engagement and co-\nproduction between scientists, practitioners and intended users are important determinants of the type of climate service developed\nand their utility for supporting adaptation, mitigation and risk management decisions. They require different types of user&#8211;producer\nengagement depending on what the service aims to deliver (high confidence), and these fall into three broad categories: website-\nbased services, interactive group activities and focused relationships.</td>

      <td>A significant innovation in the AR6 WGI Report is the Atlas. Part of its remit is to provide region-by-region assessment on changes in\nmean climate and to link with other WGI chapters to generate climate change information for the regions. An important component\nis the new online interactive tool, the Interactive Atlas, with flexible spatial and temporal analyses of much of the observed, simulated\npast and projected future climate change data underpinning the WGI assessment. This includes the ability to generate global maps\nand a number of regionally aggregated products (time series, scatter plots, tables, etc.) for a range of observations and ensemble\nclimate change projections of variables (such as changes in the climatic impact-drivers summarized in Table TS.5) from the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5, CMIP6) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment\n(CORDEX). The data can be displayed and summarized under a range of SSP-RCP scenarios and future time slices and also for different\nglobal warming levels, relative to several different baseline periods. The maps and various statistics can be generated for annual mean\ntrends and changes or for any user-specified season. A new set of WGI reference regions is used for the regional summary statistics\nand applied widely throughout the report (with the regions, along with aggregated datasets and the code to generate these, available\nat the ATLAS GitHub: https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas).</td>
