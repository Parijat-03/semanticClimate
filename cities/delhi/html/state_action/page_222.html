Insufficient observational and scientific information database discourages attempts to assess the climate change implications for the state. Further there is a lack of clear understanding of important processes like desertification, which requires the monitoring of various parameters such as changes in water quality &amp; quantity, biomass, biodiversity, soil salinity etc. No specific studies have been conducted to monitor this process in the state. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.21" top="607.47"><span x0="72.02" y0="607.47" x1="526.21" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 607.47; y1: 619.47; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Scale and spatial distribution of the data: Meteorological data has to be available at adequate scales for models to provide outputs that are policy relevant. There is little or no meteorological data available at the district level. A high number of observations network is essential for validating the modelling outputs. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.24" top="533.88"><span x0="72.02" y0="533.88" x1="526.24" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 533.88; y1: 545.88; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Digitization of information: Socio economic information containing in district statistical handbook is not available in digital format for all years as well as the GIS and remotely sensed data. There is no digitized database at the state level, and no databases at the district level for socio economic data. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.34" top="460.44"><span x0="72.02" y0="460.44" x1="526.34" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 460.44; y1: 472.44; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Fragmented knowledge base: Existing data and information is fragmented at multiple sources. There is a lack of systemic institutional mechanism for collating, synthesizing and delivering knowledge products for decision making on climate change. Poor connectivity between diverse knowledge generation communities is a hindering knowledge exchange process. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.23" top="386.98"><span x0="72.02" y0="386.98" x1="526.23" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 386.98; y1: 398.98; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Inventorize traditional knowledge: While the benefits of traditional knowledge to enhance resilience of communities to climate change are acknowledged, there have been limited efforts to inventorize and scale up traditional knowledge. It is important to assimilate the traditional knowledge systems and reference them to the social contexts of the region. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="313.54"><span x0="72.02" y0="313.54" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 313.54; y1: 325.54; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Capacity building: Capacity building at various levels, including strengthening the base, creating centres of excellence in priority areas in existing institutions; and setting up new institutions in gap areas that allows a for leveraging the global and national knowledge base is important. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="478.78" top="231.79"><span x0="72.02" y0="231.79" x1="478.78" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 231.79; y1: 243.79; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">17.5Strategies for State Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change </span></div><div left="72.02" right="253.25" top="204.07"><span x0="72.02" y0="204.07" x1="253.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 204.07; y1: 216.07; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Key Strategy 1: Knowledge creation  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.09" top="178.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="178.27" x1="526.09" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 178.27; y1: 190.27; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 1: Facilitate studies related to climate change vulnerability and impact assessments for better preparedness - The overall aim will be to develop a cross-sectoral adaptation strategy based on the analysis of the projected climate change impacts and the assessment of vulnerability in the following key sectors: Hydrology and water resources Agriculture and animal husbandry, Desertification, Forestry and biodiversity, Livelihoods, Human health. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.29" top="88.85"><span x0="72.02" y0="88.85" x1="526.29" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 88.85; y1: 100.85; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 2: Study on Climate projections using scientific Models- There is need to assess likely future growth scenarios in the state using an optimization energy environment modelling </span></div></body></html>
