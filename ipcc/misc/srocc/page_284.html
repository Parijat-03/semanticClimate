Similarly, drought and overgrazing led to loss of biodiversity in Pakistan to the point that only drought-adapted species can now survive on the arid rangelands (Akhter and Arshad 2006). Similar trends were observed in desert steppes of Mongolia (Khishigbayar et al. 2015). In contrast, the increase in annual moistening of southern European Russia from the late 1980s to the beginning of the 21st century caused the restoration of steppe vegetation, even under conditions of strong anthropogenic pressure (Ivanov et al. 2018). The seed banks of annual species can often survive over the long term, germinating in wet years, suggesting that these species could be resilient to some aspects of climate change (Vetter et al. 2005). Yet, Hiernaux and Hou&#233;rou (2006) showed that overgrazing in the Sahel tended to decrease the seed bank of annuals, which could make them vulnerable to climate change over time. Perennial species, considered as the structuring element of the ecosystem, are usually less affected as they have deeper roots, xeromorphic properties and physiological mechanisms that increase drought tolerance (Le Hou&#233;rou 1996). However, in North Africa, long-term monitoring (1978&#8211;2014) has shown that important plant perennial species have also disappeared due to drought (</span><span style="x0: 93.43; x1: 97.64; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="93.43" y0="459.56" x1="159.06">Stipa tenacissima </span><span style="x0: 159.82; x1: 164.22; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="159.82" y0="459.56" x1="175.65">and </span><span style="x0: 176.41; x1: 181.86; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="176.41" y0="459.56" x1="252.83">Artemisia herba alba</span><span style="x0: 252.83; x1: 255.47; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="252.83" y0="459.56" x1="307.32">) (Hirche et al. 2018; Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel 2013).

Over 30% of the endemic bird areas are located within these regions, which is also home to 25% of vertebrate species (Maestre et al. 2012; MEA 2005). Yet, many species within drylands are threatened with extinction (Durant et al. 2014; Walther 2016). Habitat degradation and deserti&#64257;cation are generally associated with biodiversity loss (Ceballos et al. 2010; Tang et al. 2018; Newbold et al. 2015). The &#8216;grazing value&#8217; of land declines with both a&#160;reduction in vegetation cover and shrub encroachment, with the former being more detrimental to native vertebrates (Parsons et al. 2017). Conversely, shrub encroachment may buffer deserti&#64257;cation by increasing resource and microclimate availability, resulting in an increase in vertebrate species abundance and richness observed in the shrub-encroached arid grasslands of North America (Whitford 1997) and Australia (Parsons et al. 2017). However, compared to historically resilient drylands, these encroached habitats and their new species assemblages may be more sensitive to droughts, which may become more prevalent with climate change (Schooley et al. 2018). Mammals and birds may be particularly sensitive to droughts because they rely on evaporative cooling to maintain their body temperatures within an optimal range (Hetem et al. 2016) and risk lethal dehydration in water limited environments (Albright et al. 2017).
