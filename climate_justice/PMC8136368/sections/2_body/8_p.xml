Oxfam have calculated that the 26 richest people in the world (including Bill Gates) currently own the same amount of wealth as those 3.8 billion poorest people collectively.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> When it comes to carbon emissions, 50% of which are directly related to lifestyle are emitted by the richest 10% of people in the world. The poorest 50% of our global society emit just 10% of the pollution<sup>7</sup>. The book also does not acknowledge the other major environmental disasters that are also occurring such as pollution, deforestation, habitat destruction and extinctions. All of these, like climate change, are caused by our fixation on consumption and the drive by companies such as Microsoft to try and sell us more stuff.</p>
