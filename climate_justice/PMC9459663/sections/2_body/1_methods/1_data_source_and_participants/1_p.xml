<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In a cross-sectional design, we combined survey data on 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa participating in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); the eTable in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220857-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref> provides country-specific surveys and years. Demographic and Health Surveys are cross-sectional, nationally representative household surveys conducted worldwide that use a stratified 2-stage cluster sampling design selecting enumeration areas and households within each enumeration area.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> All female individuals of reproductive age (15-49 years) from selected households are invited to participate in the survey. Male individuals aged 15 to 59 years are recruited from households included in the nationally representative household survey. Selection criteria are country-specific; in some surveys, all men are sampled and in others, a proportion of households (eg, a third to half of randomly selected among the nationally representative household sample) are selected for the men&#8217;s survey. The men&#8217;s age range is higher since men in the households of women of reproductive age (eg, partners) may have larger age ranges.</p>
