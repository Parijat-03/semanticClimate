In this respect, modelling frameworks can help explore the benefits of different technological configurations towards energy autonomy <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, as well as the ways in which envisaged innovations can be adopted by and diffused into households of different profiles <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. From a modelling perspective, research can also delve into policy instruments and market models that target low-carbon investment or purchasing decisions <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref> based on consumer preferences, explore policies that go beyond market models <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, as well as simulate real-life behaviour and modal shifts <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. In doing so, demand-side insights can complement supply-side research, by better informing tipping points or barriers for electrification strategies, evolution of infrastructure and introduction of low-carbon or carbon&#8211;neutral fuels.</p>
