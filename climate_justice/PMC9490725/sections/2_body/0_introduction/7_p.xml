It reveals how the dominance of MBMs reflects the existing policy environment biased by market thinking, which entrenches existing economic power and acts as a discourse of climate delay. Making a link between the work of Felli and Sandel shows how focusing on MBMs is attractive to policymakers because it allows them to avoid difficult decisions regarding the energy transition. Accepting the failure of market-based thinking would require that policymakers consider alternative economic approaches such as degrowth that would require limits on the market, something that neither policymakers nor private firms are prepared to accept.</p>
