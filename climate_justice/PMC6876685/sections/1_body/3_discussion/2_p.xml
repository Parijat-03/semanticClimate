<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Climate change already affects individuals, populations, and ecosystems and will continue altering the lives of today's college students. Do students understand these effects? Are they concerned? And do they think humans can&#8212;and will&#8212;take action to fight climate change? Our survey indicates that participants entered this course accepting that climate change is occurring, and that their understanding of and concern about climate change increased during the course. Even more notable, perhaps, is what did not change: These students entered and left the course pessimistic about whether humans would successfully address climate change, despite their having the means to do so. As we discuss in this section, meaningfully increasing students' climate literacy requires not only increasing student knowledge, but also preparing and inspiring them to make use of that knowledge. Introductory science coursework can and should support these efforts; our climate future depends, in part, on the kind of climate literacy our pedagogy supports. </p>
