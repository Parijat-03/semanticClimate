<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">carbon budget</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><div><p class="definition" style="font-weight: bold">Refers to two concepts in the literature:<br>(i)&#160;an assessment of carbon cycle <em><a href="#source" class="mention">sources</a></em> and <em><a href="#sink" class="mention">sinks</a></em> on a global level, through the synthesis of evidence for <em>fossil fuel</em> and cement emissions, emissions and removals associated with <em><a href="#land_use" class="mention">land use</a></em> and <em><a href="#land-use_change" class="mention">land-use change</a></em>, ocean and natural land sources and sinks of <em><a href="#carbon_dioxide" class="mention">carbon dioxide (CO2)</a></em>, and the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration.</p><p>This is referred to as the global carbon budget;<br>(ii)&#160;the maximum amount of cumulative net global <em><a href="#anthropogenic" class="mention">anthropogenic</a></em> CO2 emissions that would result in limiting <em><a href="#global_warming" class="mention">global warming</a></em> to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate <em>forcers</em>. This is referred to as the Total Carbon Budget when expressed starting from the <em><a href="#pre-industrial" class="mention">pre-industrial</a></em> period, and as the remaining carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date.<br><br><br><br>
</p></div><p>Note 1: Net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anthropogenic CO2 emissions minus anthropogenic CO2 removals. See also <em><a href="#carbon_dioxide_removal" class="mention">Carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</a></em>.<br>Note 2: The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions is reached at the time that annual net anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach zero.<br>Note 3: The degree to which anthropogenic climate forcers other than CO2 affect the total carbon budget and remaining carbon budget depends on human choices about the extent to which these forcers are mitigated and their resulting <em><a href="#climate" class="mention">climate</a></em> effects.<br>Note 4: The notions of a total carbon budget and remaining carbon budget are also being applied in parts of the scientific literature and by some entities at regional, national, or sub-national level. The distribution of global budgets across individual different entities and emitters depends strongly on considerations of equity and other value judgements.</p><p></p></dd><div>
