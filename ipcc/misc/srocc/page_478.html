In 2015, 14.5&#160;million people were assisted through disaster-risk reduction, climate change and/or resilience building activities (WFP 2018). However, there is no agreement on how to better use emergency food aid, since it can come with unintended consequences for individuals, groups, regions, and countries (Barrett 2006). These may include negative dependency of food recipients (Lentz et al. 2005) or price increases, among others. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="591.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="591.54" x1="307.6">Some authors state that tied food aid provided as &#8216;in kind&#8217; by the donor country hampers local food production (Clay 2006), although others found no evidence of this (Ferri&#232;re and Suwa-Eisenmann 2015).

Agroecological, social, and cultural contexts are considered throughout.

However, if unabated climate change continues, limits to adaptation will be reached (SR15). In the food system, adaptation actions involve any activities designed to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience of the system to climate change. In some areas, expanded climate envelopes will alter agroecological zones, with opportunity for expansion towards higher latitudes and&#160;altitudes, soil and water resources permitting (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="591.55"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 591.55; y1: 601.05; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="591.55" x1="566.08">More extreme climatic events are projected to lead to more agrometeorological disasters with associated economic and social losses. There are many options for adapting the food system to extreme events reported in IPCC (2012), highlighting measures that reduce exposure and vulnerability and increase resilience, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (IPCC 2012). Adaptation responses to extreme events aim to minimise damages, modify threats, prevent adverse impacts, or share losses, thus making the system more resilient (Harvey et al. 2014a). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="471.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.61; y0: 471.56; y1: 481.06; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="471.56" x1="566.11">With current and projected climate change (higher temperature, changes in precipitation, &#64258;ooding and extremes events), achieving adaptation will require both technological (e.g.,&#160;recovering and improving orphan crops, new cultivars from breeding or biotechnology) and non-technological (e.g.,&#160;markets, land management, dietary change) solutions. Climate interacts with other factors such as food supplied over longer distances and policy drivers (Mbow et al. 2008; Howden et al. 2007), as well as local agricultural productivity.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="363.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.86; y0: 363.57; y1: 373.07; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="363.57" x1="566.12">Given the site-speci&#64257;c nature of climate change impacts on food system components together with wide variation in agroecosystems types and management, and socio-economic conditions, it is widely understood that adaptation strategies are linked to environmental and cultural contexts at the regional and local levels (</span><span style="x0: 547.98; x1: 552.56; y0: 315.58; y1: 325.08; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="547.98" y0="315.58" x1="566.09">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 356.93; x1: 359.57; y0: 303.58; y1: 313.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="356.93" y0="303.58" x1="566.11">).
