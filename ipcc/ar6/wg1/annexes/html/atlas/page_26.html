The reason for using bias adjustment for some of the results displayed in Figure Atlas.23: is that the 27 historical simulations of the climate models used to generate these projected changes often validate poorly 28 when compared with observations. If the mean of the distribution of daily maximum temperatures is shifted 29 by a few &#176;C then even if the shape of the distribution is well captured the frequency of exceedance of a high 30 threshold event will be significantly biased. In order to correct results from the models for these biases and to 31 provide a basis for a reasonable comparison between them, this issue is generally addressed by applying bias 32 correction to the model data based on comparing distributions from the historical simulations with 33 observations. As there are several approaches to bias adjustment and no clearly preferred method (see 34 Chapter 10) the results in Figure Atlas.23: should be taken as indicative of the direction of change and of the 35 relative impact of different future scenarios with </span><span style="x0: 272.7; x1: 275.75; y0: 339.29; y1: 350.27; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="272.7" y0="339.29" x1="341.69">low confidence </span><span x0="341.7" y0="339.29" x1="41.44" style="x0: 341.7; x1: 344.75; y0: 339.29; y1: 350.27; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">in the absolute values.

Its structure aligns most closely with that of the regional chapters and cross-chapter papers in 46 the WG II report, with sections on Small Island States, the main continental and polar regions (subdivided 47 where relevant) and case studies relevant to typological domains. It focuses on assessing observed, attributed 48 and projected changes in mean surface air temperature and precipitation and the regional evaluation of global 49 and regional models, drawing out and illustrating key findings which can be explored further in the 50 Interactive Atlas. In particular, changes in mean and extreme temperatures and precipitation are displayed in 51 the Interactive Atlas in terms of a number of illustrative indices (including some of the indices assessed in 52 Chapter 12, thus supporting and extending the assessment performed in this chapter) and allowing for a 53 regional analysis of the results. This also builds and expands on and complements the assessment of 54 extremes in Chapter 11. The Interactive Atlas then presents the different regional information that has been 55 assessed in these chapters and in the CORDEX and other region-specific literature assessed in the Atlas, 56 </span></div></body></html>
