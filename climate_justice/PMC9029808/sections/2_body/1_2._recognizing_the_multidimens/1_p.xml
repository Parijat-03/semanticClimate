<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The climate crisis has been increasingly acknowledged by the scholarly and health community as one of the greatest threats to public health and human rights [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There is ample research showing how climate change is already affecting people&#8217;s physical and psychological health, through both direct exposure to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms, and floods, and indirect disruption to food systems, water security, and health care services [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Worldwide temperature and humidity increase is causing a rise in cases of vector-borne diseases (such as dengue, chikungunya virus, Lyme disease), diarrheal diseases, and foodborne diseases [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Climate-associated health risks are expected to further burden climate-vulnerable communities, in particular people from low-income backgrounds, racialized groups, Indigenous people, women, children, older adults, and those already suffering from chronic disease [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Variabilities in temperatures, especially heatwaves, and exposure to climate hazards particularly impact maternal and neonatal health, including higher rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth, and neonatal stress, leading to adverse child health in the long term [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Vector-borne diseases are associated with sociodemographic factors, including economic status, housing quality, and susceptibility, which puts that same population at greater risk [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under high emission scenarios, it is estimated that 48,000 more children under 15 years of age could die of diarrhea in 2030 [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cases of asthma, the most common chronic disease among children and adolescents worldwide, are increasing due to rising temperatures [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Extreme weather events can also limit young girls&#8217; access to sexual and reproductive health services, leading to an increase in unwanted pregnancies, complications and death during childbirth, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, the World Health Organization has stressed that &#8220;the climate crisis threatens to undo the last fifty years of progress in development, global health, and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities both between and within populations&#8221; [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Projections show that between 2030 and 2050 there will be an additional 250,000 deaths per year due to climate change-induced heat, undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal diseases, with more than half of this mortality being in Africa [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
