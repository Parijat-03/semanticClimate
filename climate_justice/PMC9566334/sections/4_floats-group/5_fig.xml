Line of best fit is determined by ordinary least squares univariate linear regression. n = 711,616. Gray lines are 95% credibility values. Dased line is the line of best fit derived from ordinary least squares linear regression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijerph-19-12314-g006" position="float"/></fig>
