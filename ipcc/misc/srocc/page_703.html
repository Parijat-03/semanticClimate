Climate change reduces the functionality, stability, and adaptability of ecosystems (Pecl et al. 2017). For example, drought affects cropland and forest productivity and reduces associated harvests (provisioning services). In additional, extreme changes in precipitation may reduce the capacity of forests to provide stability for groundwater (regulation and maintenance services). Prolonged periods of high temperature may cause widespread death of trees in tropical mountains, boreal and tundra forests, impacting on diverse ES, including aesthetic and cultural services (Verbyla 2011; Chapin et al. 2010; Krishnaswamy et al. 2014).

However, the multiplicity of approaches and the resulting variability in projections make it dif&#64257;cult to get a&#160;clear picture of the future of biodiversity under different scenarios of global climatic change (Pereira et al. 2010). Biodiversity is also severely impacted on by climate change induced land degradation and ecosystem transformation (Pecl et al. 2017). This may affect humans directly and indirectly through cascading impacts on ecosystem function and services (Millennium Assessment 2005). Climate change related human migration is likely to impact on biodiversity as people move into and contribute to land stress in biodiversity hotspots now and in the future; and as humans concurrently move into areas where biodiversity is also migrating to adapt to climate change (Oglethorpe et al. 2007).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="526.56" top="735.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.09; y0: 735.42; y1: 745.42; width: 5.37; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.42" x1="526.56">Climate and land change increases risk to respiratory and&#160;infectious disease</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="699.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="699.52" x1="571.78">In addition to risks related to nutrition articulated in Figure&#160;7.1, human health can be affected by climate change through extreme heat and cold, changes in infectious diseases, extreme events, and land cover and land use (Hasegawa et al. 2016; Ryan et al. 2015; Terrazas et al. 2015; Kweka et al. 2016; Yamana et al. 2016).

In the Amazon, research shows that deforestation (both net loss and fragmentation) increases malaria, where vectors are expected to increase their home range (Alimi et al. 2015; Ren et al. 2016), confounded with multiple factors, such as social-economic conditions and immunity (Tucker Lima et al. 2017; Barros and Hon&#243;rio 2015). Deforestation has been shown to enhance the survival and development of major malaria vectors (Wang et al. 2016).
