Interestingly, these practices and movements are often located in history and art museums. For example, the Center for Empathy and the Visual Arts within the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Center for Empathy and the Visual Arts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">n.d.</xref>) focuses on research and institutional practices (for staff and visitors alike) that foster and promote empathy and global awareness through the arts. In another example, the Empathy Museum (Empathy Museum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">n.d.</xref>) includes traveling participatory art projects that focus on issues of prejudice, inequality, and conflict through the lens of empathy. Their primary goal is to help visitors &#8220;see&#8221; the world through others&#8217; perspectives and experiences. We argue that it is equally compelling and necessary to locate and foster empathy in the context of science museums (and broadly speaking, in the science education field) in part because of a dominant tradition of (re)presenting science as objective, and void of context (e.g., social, cultural, environmental, political, and ethical). Fourth-generation science museums can develop spaces and practices that invite visitors to take part, feel deeply, and better understand others.</p>
