<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The biophysical coverage of <em>land</em> (e.g., bare soil, rocks, forests, buildings and roads or lakes). Land cover is often categorised in broad land-cover classes (e.g., deciduous forest, coniferous forest, mixed forest, grassland bare ground). <br>[Note: In some literature, land cover and land use are used interchangeably, but the two represent distinct classification systems. For example, the land cover class woodland can be under various land uses such as livestock grazing, recreation, conservation, or wood harvest.]</p></dd>
