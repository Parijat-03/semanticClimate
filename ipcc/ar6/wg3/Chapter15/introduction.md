Finance for climate action (or climate finance), environmental finance (which also covers other 
 environmental priorities such as water, air pollution and biodiversity), and sustainable finance (which 
 encompasses issues relating to socio-economic impacts, poverty alleviation and empowerment) are 
 interrelated rather than mutually exclusive concepts (UNEP Inquiry 2016a; ICMA 2020a). Their 
 combination is needed to align mitigation investments with multiple SDGs, at a minimum, minimize 
 the conflicts between climate targets and SDGs not being targeted. From a climate policy perspective, 
 climate finance refers to finance “whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or enhance 
 resilience to the impacts of climate variability and projected climate change” (UNFCCC 2018a).
However, as pinpointed in the AR5, significant room for interpretation and context-specific 
considerations remain. Further, such definition needs to be put in perspective with the expectations of 
 investors and financiers.
 
Specifying the scope of climate finance requires defining two terms: what qualifies as “finance” and as 
“climate” respectively. In terms of what type of finance to consider, options include considering 
investments or total costs , stocks or flows, gross or net (the latter taking into account 
 reflows and/or depreciation), and domestic or cross-border, public or private . In terms 
 of what may be considered as “climate”, a key difference relates to measuring climate-specific finance 
 (only accounts for the portion finance resulting in climate benefits) or climate-related finance (captures 
total project costs and aims to measure the mainstreaming of climate considerations). One should even 
consider the investments decided for reasons unrelated with climate objectives but contribute to these
