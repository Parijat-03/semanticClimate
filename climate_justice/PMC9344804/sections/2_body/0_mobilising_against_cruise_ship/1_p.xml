<disp-quote><p>Immense floating boxes pass through the basin of San Marco: they are white, they call them ships, and as a&#160;matter of fact they should be, but compared to the splendid ships of the past [&#8230;] their only function is to carry passengers, as many as possible.</p><p>These ships have neither refinement nor good taste, they are inspired by the casinos of Las Vegas, and on board they keep what they promise: a&#160;resort-like holiday, [&#8230;] guests in sandals and shorts, oozing with sun cream. Cruise passengers who are part of the perhaps 30&#160;or more million visitors a&#160;year that suffocate Venice, increasingly turning it into a&#160;kitsch postcard of itself, because the Stazione Marittima is by now one of the main gateways to the kind of &#8220;hit and run&#8221; tourism that the authorities only in words say they want to oppose to. [&#8230;] Many Venetians no longer want them and are mobilizing [&#8230;] but large ships cannot be banned just because they are ugly or disgraceful. They are actually rather harmful and dangerous for the city and its people, despite the Port Authority&#8217;s claims to the contrary.
