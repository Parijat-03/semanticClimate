The complementary relation of both pathways envisages first, a modal shift towards sustainable effective and efficient transport systems, and second a substitution towards alternative drives in the remaining vehicles. In this paper, we limit the presentation to the &#8220;alternative drive&#8221; pathways due to a lack of space. The results of the &#8220;multi- and inter-modality pathway&#8221; will be published separately. For the &#8220;alternative drive&#8221; pathway, the target formulation reads as follows:<disp-quote><p id="Par22">The transformation path &#8220;alternative drives&#8221; contributes substantially to a climate-friendly and sustainable transport system in the remaining motorized private transport (MPT) in 2050. With the focus on changes on the supply side due to technology development, the penetration of the vehicle fleet with highly efficient alternative drive technologies supplemented by the provision of a climate-neutral fuel mix is centre stage. Alternative drive refers to the diffusion of purely battery electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and fuel cell vehicles as well as further efficiency improvements in conventional drives powered by climate-neutral liquid and gaseous fuels (first- and second-generation biofuels, biomass to liquids, power to liquids, power to gas), which also contributes to a climate-neutral MPT. The technology mix of the vehicle fleet and the fuel consumption in 2050 will differ considerably from the year 2021.</p></disp-quote></p>
