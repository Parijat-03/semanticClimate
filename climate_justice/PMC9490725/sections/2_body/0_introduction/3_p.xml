The first is the study of regulation in business ethics, which has seen a trend away from command-and-control approaches towards voluntary regulation (Andrade et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Bowen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>) and CSR (Herzog, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>; Roth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). Looking specifically at the regulation of carbon emissions, governments around the world are turning towards market-based solutions (Skovgaard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2019</xref>) with only limited attention given to direct regulation or bans (Green &amp; Denniss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). Due to the many drawbacks of MBMs, some authors have called for renewed attention to direct regulation (Pearse &amp; B&#246;hm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2014</xref>). Part of the challenge to this renewed attention is that the literature also shows how such alternatives have been depoliticised and rendered invisible. A gap in the business ethics literature was identified by Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>), who argued that the reasons why some instruments reach the discussion stage and others never do has been under-addressed.</p>
