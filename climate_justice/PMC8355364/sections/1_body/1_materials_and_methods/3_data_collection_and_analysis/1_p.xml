<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The interviews were conducted by the first author of this article. The following basic principles were to be observed when conducting the interviews: As little guidance as possible, because the goal of the interviews was to get the interviewees to narrate freely; situational adjustment of the question sequence and wording; asking clarifying follow-up questions if necessary; no evaluative comments as interviewer; and only minimal expressions of empathy (such as nodding the head). The interview itself consisted of eight parts, each of which began with an introductory question: (1) &#8220;How did you get into your (first) initiative?&#8221; (2) &#8220;Tell me about the first day, your first time in your (first) initiative?&#8221; (3) &#8220;How is it today? Tell me about yourself and your initiative work today&#8221; (4) &#8220;How would you describe your progress in your initiative?&#8221; (5) &#8220;Looking back, what do you take away from your time in your initiative until today?&#8221; (6) &#8220;What will happen to you and your initiative in the future?&#8221; (7) &#8220;What do you have to say about climate change?&#8221; and (8) &#8220;What has not yet been asked and said that would be relevant today?&#8221; The interview guide also contained suggestions for possible follow-up questions that could be adapted to the situation. Taken as a whole, the questions aimed not only to capture the status quo but also to reflect subjective perceptions of developments.</p>
