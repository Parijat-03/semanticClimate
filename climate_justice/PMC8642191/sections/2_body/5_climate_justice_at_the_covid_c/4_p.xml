To access this facility, each Member State must submit to the Commission a recovery and resilience plan (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021d</xref>, Art. 18.1). At least 37% of the plan&#8217;s total allocation must be dedicated to climate action, which the Commission is to assess based on a detailed methodology set out in Annex VI of the RRF regulation (Ibid, Art. 19.3(e)). Plans must also observe the &#8216;no significant harm&#8217; principle of the taxonomy regulation and be consistent with territorial just transition plans (Ibid, Art. 17.3, 18.4(e)).</p>
