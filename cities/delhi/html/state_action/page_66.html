Energy services in the residential sector mainly includes cooking, space heating, lighting &amp; major appliances. The different energy sources used to meet these services includes electricity, LPG, natural gas and kerosene. For a city like Delhi, which is largely urban &amp; still in the developing stage, the energy intensity of households is likely to increase with a rise in per capita income of people. Historical trends have shown an increase in per capita consumption of energy with an increase in per capita income.   </span></div><div left="72.02" right="167.06" top="601.59"><span x0="72.02" y0="601.59" x1="167.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 601.59; y1: 613.59; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Transport Sector: </span><span x0="166.94" y0="601.59" x1="508.26" style="x0: 166.94; x1: 174.27; y0: 601.59; y1: 613.59; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The basic assumption for the projection of energy need in the transport sector is that energy demand in the transport sector is directly proportional to number of vehicles, type of vehicles &amp; GSDP growth rate keeping other factors constant. Road transport is the major travel mode in Delhi, though some shift has come with expansion of Metro Rail service in Delhi and NCR. The major mode of transport in Delhi includes buses, metro rail, cars, two-wheeler &amp; autos. The various fuels consumed in the transport sector include petrol, diesel and CNG. The total number of vehicles in Delhi has gone up from 3.3 million in 2000-01 to 9.25 million in the year 2015-16. Historical trends have shown a rise in number of personal vehicles with a rise in per capita income of people. Though this trend is likely to continue, it is expected that with expansion of Metro and better bus transport the growth of private individual vehicles will be controlled. With a rise in aggregate number of vehicles the total fuel requirement will also increase in the future, nevertheless introduction of new technology will play important role.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="180.62" top="383.26"><span x0="72.02" y0="383.26" x1="180.62" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 383.26; y1: 395.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Commercial Sector: </span><span x0="183.38" y0="383.26" x1="508.23" style="x0: 183.38; x1: 190.71; y0: 383.26; y1: 395.26; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The basic assumption for the projection of energy need in the commercial sector is that energy demand in the commercial sector is directly proportional to population &amp; GSDP growth rate keeping other factors constant. The growth of commercial activities is closely related to the growth of other sectors. The commercial sector includes service businesses, such as shops and stores, hotels and motels, restaurants, and hospitals, as well as a wide range of facilities, such as public schools, specialized governmental facilities, and religious organizations. In the commercial sector the major sources of energy consumption are electricity and cooking gas. Over the next 15 years commercial energy demand will continue to rise, as a result of increasing commercial activities from growing population and higher per capita income of people. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="165.62" top="212.47"><span x0="72.02" y0="212.47" x1="165.62" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.69; y0: 212.47; y1: 224.47; width: 4.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Industrial Sector: </span><span x0="165.38" y0="212.47" x1="508.24" style="x0: 165.38; x1: 172.71; y0: 212.47; y1: 224.47; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The basic assumption for the projection of energy need in the industrial sector is that energy demand in the industrial sector is directly proportional to the type of commodities produced by industries in Delhi. Industrial energy consumption can be divided into two sub-sectors: energy-intensive industries and light (or non-energy-intensive) industries. In Delhi, majority of industries are non-energy intensive industries and as a result the consumption of energy in industrial sector in Delhi is less as compared to other sectors. In the industrial sector the major sources of energy consumption includes electricity and fuels like soft coke, LDO etc. Over the next 15 years the aggregate industrial energy demand is expected to increase but at a rate lower than that of other sectors &amp; </span></div></body></html>
