Toward these ends, I instituted a number of changes to build upon the fine works of my predecessor, the late Dr. Carolyn Saari. Specifically, I expanded the editorial board and consulting reviewer pool to include international social work luminaries, thereby establishing the <italic>CSWJ</italic> as a global entity, one more responsive to the needs of a cross-cultural readership. As part of that expansion, I continually sought reviewers with expertise in different evidence-based practice modalities, problem areas, theoretical perspectives, and vulnerable client populations to better tailor the review process to meet the didactic needs of the writers, some of whom were first time authors. To further enhance the quality and standing of the <italic>CSWJ</italic>, I employed a double-blind review process, increased the number of reviewers from two to three, and reduced the turnaround time from submission to decision.</p>
