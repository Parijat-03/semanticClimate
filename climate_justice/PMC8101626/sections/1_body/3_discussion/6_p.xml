<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In summary, the migration of IDWeek 2020 to a virtual medium still allowed for educational and topical conversation on the Twitter platform. We urge users to be thorough when evaluating information on Twitter, given the sometimes superficial nature in the assessment of evidence. However, Twitter can be useful when trying to keep abreast of the rapidly changing landscape of medical literature, and we believe the information gained from our analyses can help a general Twitter user identify accounts of interest and uncover valuable information for IDWeek organizers as they plan future conferences. Despite the loss of the personal and humanistic feel to previous IDWeeks, social networks allowed individuals to engage in a network far beyond their in-person ones. Given the increasing Twitter activity at medical conferences, we expect Twitter to continue to play a significant role in engaging the Infectious Diseases community in the future.</p>
