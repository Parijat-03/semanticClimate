This article provides insights into how layers of overlapping disadvantage are being challenged in one community in northern Bangladesh. The hypothesis guiding our empirical research and analysis is that although the wheat&#8211;maize innovation processes in the community are primarily directed at middle-income male farmers, women from different income classes and ethnicities are seeking inclusion. The research questions are: (1) what strategies do women develop to participate in innovation processes as individuals and through organisations? and (2) what do women gain from securing inclusion? Collectively, these research questions set out to explore how women deploy their agency to lift themselves out of poverty by securing a role in wheat&#8211;maize innovation processes and whether these strategies differ depending on the type of marginalisation &#8211; as women, indigenous minorities or low and middle-income farmers. In the conclusion, we build on Kabeer&#8217;s (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) work to define women&#8217;s empowerment through the concepts of agency and power to help us interpret the findings. We expect this analysis and findings to help understand how agricultural research partners can work to strengthen the contribution and voices of the women who have long experienced differing forms of marginalisation; and support their resistance.</p>
