The discussion, instead of focussing exclusively on the specificities of geoengineering, framed these applications within a wider context coupling concerns with the economy, technology, society and ethics, and participants often shared their struggles regarding the meaning(s) and definition(s) of geoengineering:<disp-quote><p>I would need a clarification about what we&#8217;re talking about .&#8196;.&#8196;. I have some troubles debating geoengineering when I don&#8217;t know the science very well. (DM &#8211; Group I)</p><p>I feel that the notion of geoengineering itself is at stake. (.&#8196;.&#8196;.) What are we talking about when we talk about geoengineering? (ASM &#8211; Group IV)</p></disp-quote></p>
