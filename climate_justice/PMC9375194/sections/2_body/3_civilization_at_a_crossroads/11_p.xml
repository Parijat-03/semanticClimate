Despite more heat and less water, as well as intensifying natural disasters, including wildfires and hurricanes, Americans press on with business as usual, in pursuit of the so-called American dream. For example, the neighboring states of Nevada and Arizona, both dependent on water from the Colorado River, have become more and more populous, even as the water level of Lake Mead plummets dramatically to its lowest level since the 1930s. &#8220;The sense that money and technology can overcome nature has emboldened Americans,&#8221; but alas, &#8220;it will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo&#8221; (Lustgarten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). Flood insurance is currently skyrocketing for homes located in flood-zones and along waterfronts. For now, however, it is still very much business as usual, with Americans still flocking to waterfront property along the coasts and to the bright sunshine of desert regions. It is more than a little ironic that &#8220;in much of the developing world, vulnerable people will attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming, seeking cooler temperatures, more fresh water, and safety,&#8221; whereas emboldened Americans have largely &#8220;gravitated <italic>toward</italic> environmental danger, building along coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless deserts of the Southwest&#8221; (Lustgarten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>).</p>
