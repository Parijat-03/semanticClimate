The lead authors reached out to me stating that they needed more &#8220;inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;representation&#8221; from social scientists working with the human dimensions of climate change that prioritized &#8220;local/indigenous knowledge.&#8221; They added that while the IPCC institutional mandates around knowledge production were quite rigid, there was a degree of processual freedom that was slowly emerging which allowed certain unique customizations within individual chapters of the report. I probed further asking how they hoped to incorporate and represent the narratives rooted in such knowledges, especially since the rubric set up to disseminate individual pieces of scholarship seemed to be unaware of the contentious nature of climate knowledge production that I had encountered in the Himalayas. Additionally, I wanted to understand if there was space within their frameworks of detection and attribution to adequately represent the diversity of climate change narratives that emergently constituted their conceptual bounding of &#8220;local&#8221; and &#8220;indigenous.&#8221; Each narrative within this pantheon reflected the intersectional subject positions of its bearers and revealed their unique engagements with transforming social-ecological assemblages and systems. Ultimately, I was unsure about the functional value and the moral (and political) ramifications of presenting and in many ways extracting the required &#8220;data&#8221; from emergent and more-than-material renditions of climate-society relationships from critical social science and humanities scholarship. It seemed the lead authors were genuinely interested in pluralizing the process of knowledge production, while simultaneously being held accountable by a specific epistemic mandate. These conversations materialized over many months which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic adding emotional and physical burden for a multi-disciplinary team of scholars spread across the world. Three significant points emerged through these conversations. First, there is an emerging desire within the IPCC to engage with knowledges that are rooted in worldviews that differ significantly from euro-modern science. However, the rules of engagement are still being explored and are unlikely to remain constant across different reports. Second, some lead authors do understand and acknowledge the fundamental differences between indigenous knowledges and western science, and the disciplinary divergences between biophysical sciences and critical social science and humanities. Thus, they recognize the difficult (and possibly unethical) task of equitably representing them through a singular analytical framework. The inclusion of various social science and humanities scholarship in their reports is seen as a significant positive transformation towards addressing the dissonance. Third, while the IPCC process is open to engagement with different narratives of climate-society relationships, at present, such engagement is not a significant consideration when designing analytical pathways for the detection and attribution of climate change impacts. As I gradually became aware of these contingencies, I faced a key ethical dilemma: to engage with the IPCC with a transformational agenda, given its various shortcomings, or to walk away from it and allow its epistemological biases to endure?</p>
