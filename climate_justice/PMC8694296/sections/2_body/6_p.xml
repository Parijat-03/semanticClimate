Patterson, in his paper &#8220;The Right to Health and the Climate Crisis: The Vital Role of Civic Space,&#8221; expresses concern at the lack of community participation in climate crisis discussions. He notes the restrictions placed on civic space&#8212;such as bans on public gatherings and protests&#8212;throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and he fears that these restrictions could continue into the future when they are no longer needed to reduce the spread of disease. Patterson calls for human rights, public health, and environmental activists to collaborate to address climate change and to defend the civic space necessary for their participation in climate discussions. Recognizing the interrelatedness of all human rights, he contends that the right to health provides a valuable opportunity for engaging a broader range of advocates in the response to the climate crisis, while warning that civil and political rights&#8212;such as the rights to information, to participation, to freedom of association, and to peaceful assembly&#8212;must also be protected if these actors are to contribute meaningfully and be heard.</p>
