<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0015">Labor and environmental justice organizations have already provided many tools and theories, examined below, that can be applied to ensure that the current energy transition is equitable. To better understand these tools and theories, however, it is necessary to consider the origins of just transition frameworks. The concept of a just transition originated with the U.S. labor movement of the 1970&#160;s and broadened as labor organizations forged alliances with environmental justice groups starting in the 1990&#160;s. Initially the concept emerged in response to increased regulation of pollutive industries in the wake of the National Environmental Policy Act and the establishment of federal Superfund law in the U.S. Labor unions like the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers (OCAW), long vocal about the environmental impacts of their work, faced widespread job losses despite heavily funded cleanup efforts at contaminated work sites. Led by OCAW and others, workers demanded a &#8220;superfund for workers&#8221; and a &#8220;superfund for communities&#8221; that included not only worker retraining and community support, but also broader efforts to plan and design a more environmentally-friendly approach to industrial production <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Current labor organizations in the U.S. that advocate for just transition frameworks include the BlueGreen Alliance, the Labor Network for Sustainability, and the Just Transition Alliance.</p>
