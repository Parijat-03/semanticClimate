They tend to offer &#8220;a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas&#8221; (McManus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1992</xref>, p. 164). Their origin, often linked to Oppenheimer&#8217;s conceptualization of the Exploratorium museum of science (Amodio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>; Schiele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014</xref>), involves the possibility of providing first<italic>-</italic>hand experiences with scientific phenomena, generating opportunities for freedom and exploration of the space, and engaging with new ways of teaching and learning about science. In short, their primary goal is to present scientific concepts and experiences through hands-on displays (primarily addressed to children and youth) and to enhance public understanding of science (Friedman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>).</p>
