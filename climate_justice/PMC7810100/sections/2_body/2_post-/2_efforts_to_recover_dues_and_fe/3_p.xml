These authorizations typically are in effect for a specified time period (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 11). Employees have sought untimely revocation post-<italic>Janus</italic>, again arguing that they would not have joined the union and executed these authorizations had they not been required to pay fees (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 11). The courts have rejected these claims on the same grounds &#8211; the employees voluntarily chose to join the union, authorize dues deduction, and accept the benefits of membership (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 12).</p>
