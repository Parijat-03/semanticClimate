As the roles of gender and diversity in climate adaptation have not yet been sufficiently explored, particularly in higher-income contexts [<xref rid="B59-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B62-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], their contribution to climate justice through adaptation could be considered. Gender equality is a normative goal that has long been important to Public Health [<xref rid="B75-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and is becoming more prominent in climate change politics as well [<xref rid="B76-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Sex and gender relations are also established health determinants [<xref rid="B77-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Intersectionality as an analytical tool and a perspective can be used to assess &#8220;how structures of power emerge and interact&#8221; [<xref rid="B57-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] (p 418). A low-threshold approach could be to ask questions to gain insights into additional, alternative knowledge that would otherwise stay hidden, as has been proposed by Kaijser &amp; Kronsell [<xref rid="B60-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] for the field of climate change in general, and illustrated in our framework specifically for health-related adaptation. More concretely, this can entail asking about gender relations when faced with an issue related to race, or about class when faced with an issue about gender relations [<xref rid="B60-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B79-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Using the framework always requires digging deeper into what structures and powers may be affected by the proposed strategies. This focus on political processes [<xref rid="B80-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] is useful when analyzing adaptation as most of these measures stem from top-down approaches and environmental governance. As the proposed framework serves to support the assessment of patterns of health determinants and effects of adaptation on these determinants, the questions that intersectionality frameworks elicit can support recognition of these patterns.</p>
