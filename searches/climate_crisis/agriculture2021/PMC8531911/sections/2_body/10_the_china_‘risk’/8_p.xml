Prime Minister Modi seeks to dismantle public protections of its huge farm sector for corporate control, deepening agro-exporting, whereas China sustains its modern peasant sector. Here the public right to (territorial) land is the exception to the western discourse of farms as private &#8216;economic holdings,&#8217; subject to dispossession (van der Ploeg and Ye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>). This policy stabilizes a peasant sector, where almost half of annual grain production provides grain reserves (for food security), representing a rational defense of modern peasant economy (Tsui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>: 328). And this is complemented with increasing recognition of the potential of agricultural multifunctionality in resolving landscape ecological damage.</p>
