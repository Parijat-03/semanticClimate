Drawing on the wider literature on the (often obscured) political nature of environmental politics (Kenis and Lievens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), adaptation is here thus understood as political because it always involves winners and losers&#8212;be that kept implicit or made explicit (Mikulewicz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>). While mainstream discussions of adaptation (e.g. on behalf of governments) tend to focus on the objective necessity of certain interventions that are then framed in &#8216;neutral&#8217; terms of managing risks through science and technology, critical scholars underline that adaptation is always a matter of prioritizing some options over others, and unless challenged, priorities will reflect vested interests (Anguelovski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Hodson and Marvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>).</p>
