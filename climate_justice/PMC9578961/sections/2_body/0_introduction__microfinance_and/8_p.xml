In line with sustainable development interpretation and this study's goals, pursuing these steps implied analysing the whole United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/69/315 (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015</xref>). For this purpose, the following mechanism was elaborated: (i) condensing the text; clustering the 6 SDGs and grouping them into respective (ii) SD dimensions; (iii) sub-dimensions; and (iv) domains, according to their significance.</p>
