<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Scholars have highlighted that the role of the global South in climate litigation should not be overlooked. We find this contention meritorious because, despite the relatively low numbers of cases from LMICs, many, most notably in Colombia, Ecuador, Bangladesh and India, were eco-centric cases brought against powerful companies. The important context here is that the 52 LMICs produced a fraction of the total 2020 CO<sub>2</sub> emission [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], yet, they disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change impact and a higher risk of climate-driven health threats. Therefore, it is particularly salient for LMICs to use legal arguments based on climate injustice and vulnerability.</p>
