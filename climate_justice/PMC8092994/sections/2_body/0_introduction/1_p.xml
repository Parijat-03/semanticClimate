Homeownership also is responsible for inter-generational wealth when that substantial asset is passed down to the next generation. In addition to wealth, homeownership provides some relative security in the context of climate change that is not available to those that do not own a home. For example, a home is a valuable asset against which one can borrow to make oneself more resilient to climate impacts, but it also is an asset that is necessary to qualify for certain disaster relief or mitigation programs. Renters are often a forgotten population in this mix of resilience and relief programs, and they too often are also people of color, raising environmental justice&#8212;or &#8220;climate justice&#8221; concerns, a term often used when referring to the disparate negative impacts that minority and vulnerable groups (and countries) often face because of climate change.</p>
