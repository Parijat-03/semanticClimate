Given the urgency of climate change, the insufficiency of current public policy, and the emphasis on voluntary SBTs as a means for decarbonizing the private sectors, there is a critical need for studies from a variety of perspectives on how SBTs interact with existing and emerging climate policy. This includes exploring under what conditions SBTs may speed up or slow down more ambitious policy and how SBT influence total corporate greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding the last point, SBTs should be positioned in the broader literature on political economy, political ecology, and climate justice by asking questions such as given the global nature of capital and commodity flows, how may SBTs facilitate or hinder a just development between the Global North and Global South? With its focus on production, how may SBTs impact (in)equalities in consumption and consumption-based GHG emissions? How do companies seek to square SBTs with continued profit accumulation and what are the consequences thereof? Addressing such questions reflects the reality that any operational target will always be a socio-political choice and highlights the need for continued reflexivity and critical scrutiny of SBT-related practices.</p>
