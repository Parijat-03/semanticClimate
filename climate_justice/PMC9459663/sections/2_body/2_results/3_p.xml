<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In logistic regression analyses (<xref rid="zoi220857t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), each year of heavy rainfall was associated with 1.14 (95% CI, 1.11-1.18) higher odds of prevalent HIV infection and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) higher odds of STIs in the past 12 months. We found evidence of an association between heavy rainfall and the respondent&#8217;s reported number of sexual partners (incidence rate ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.15). <xref rid="zoi220857f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="zoi220857f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref rid="zoi220857f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> show the estimates for the associations between heavy rainfall and the 3 outcomes of interest for each country individually.
