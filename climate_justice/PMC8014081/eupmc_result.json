A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.", "affiliation": "School of Nursing, SUNY Downstate College of Health Sciences and Nursing, New York, NY, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["review-article", "Review", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Nurse's Role"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Public Health Nursing"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Global warming", "Covid-19", "Sars-cov-2"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12866"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8014081"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8014081?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "1", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2021-04-23", "dateOfCreation": "2021-02-01", "firstIndexDate": "2021-02-02", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-04-03", "dateOfRevision": "2022-07-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-01-31", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-01-31"}
