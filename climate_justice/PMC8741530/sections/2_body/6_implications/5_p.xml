While the Paris Agreement has weakened the differentiation principle and distributive justice, the temporary but necessary trade-off between distributive justice-related concerns and the formation of an acceptable new comprehensive climate regime has a strong potential of strengthening global climate justice in the long term. Against the backdrop that the USA had launched a trade war and imposed sanctions against China, China has recently resumed its climate cooperation with the USA and attended the Leaders&#8217; Summit on Climate convened by the US administration under President Biden in April 2021, which provided new certainty and dynamic for promoting global climate governance and strengthening global climate justice in a world of uncertainty.</p>
