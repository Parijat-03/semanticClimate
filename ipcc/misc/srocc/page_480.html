In India, farmers are changing sowing and harvesting timing, cultivating short duration varieties, inter-cropping, changing cropping patterns, investing in irrigation, and establishing agroforestry. These are considered as passive responses or autonomous adaptation, because they do not acknowledge that these steps are taken in response to perceived climatic changes (Tripathi and Mishra 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="110.83" top="147.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 62.17; y0: 147.55; y1: 157.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="147.55" x1="110.83">Incremental. </span><span style="x0: 112.95; x1: 115.25; y0: 147.55; y1: 157.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="112.95" y0="147.55" x1="307.55">Incremental adaptation maintains the essence and integrity of a&#160;system or process at a&#160;given scale (Park et al. 2012).

Transformational adaptation seeks alternative livelihoods and land-use strategies needed to develop new farming systems (Termeer et al. 2016). For example, limitations in incremental adaptation among smallholder rice farmers in Northwest Costa Rica led to a&#160;shift from rice to sugarcane production due to decreasing market access and water scarcity (Warner et al. 2015). Migration from the Oldman River Basin has been described as a&#160;transformational adaption to climate change in the Canadian agriculture sector (Hadarits et al. 2017). If high-end scenarios of climate change eventuate, the food security of farmers and consumers will depend on how transformational change in food systems is managed. An integrated framework of adaptive transition&#160;&#8211; management of socio-technical transitions and adaptation to socio-ecological changes&#160;&#8211; may help build transformational adaptive capacity (Mockshell and Kamanda 2018 and Pant et al. 2015). Rippke et al. (2016) has suggested overlapping phases of adaptation needed to support transformational change in Africa. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="428.08" top="519.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 519.42; y1: 529.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="519.42" x1="428.08">1.3.2.2 Risk management </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="495.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 495.52; y1: 505.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="495.52" x1="566.11">Climate risks affect all pillars of food security, particularly stability because extreme events lead to strong variation to food access. The notion of risk is widely treated in IPCC reports (IPCC 2014c) (see also Chapter&#160;7&#160;in this report). With food systems, many risks co-occur or reinforce each other, and this can limit effective adaptation planning as they require a&#160;comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a&#160;range of drivers and scales. For example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk pro&#64257;les to the establishment of ef&#64257;cient markets that facilitate response strategies will require more than systemic reviews of risk factors (Howden et al. 2007). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="363.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 363.54; y1: 373.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="363.54" x1="566.1">Integration of Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) helps to minimise the overlap and duplication of projects and programmes (Nalau et al. 2016). Recently, countries started integrating the concept of DRR and CCA.

Responding better to seasonal climate-induced food supply shocks therefore increases society&#8217;s capability to adapt to climate change.
