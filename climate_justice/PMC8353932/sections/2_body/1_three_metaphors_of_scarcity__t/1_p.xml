Among various metrics (such as greenhouse gas concentration, ocean heat content or sea-level rise), global average temperature emerged as the favoured indicator for quantifying the level of climate change. Scientifically, global temperature is considered the most suitable climate indicator because it serves as a useful intermediary between climate impacts assessment and greenhouse gas emissions projection (Knutti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>; Leemans and Vellinga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>). From a communication perspective, the simplicity of temperature target is particularly seen as a merit, an easy way to communicate the complex challenge of climate change to the public (Schellnhuber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>; Morseletto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>).</p>
