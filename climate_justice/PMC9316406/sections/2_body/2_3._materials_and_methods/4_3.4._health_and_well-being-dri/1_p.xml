A content analysis approach was employed to thematically analyze these critical reflection notes. Since climate change and disaster threaten inhabitants and co-inhabitants&#8217; health and overall well-being, health and well-being became the overarching theme that guided the entire data analysis. The overarching theme was supported by three-level social work practices (micro, mezzo, and macro). The two authors identified the codes regarding social work interventions that would enhance the residents&#8217; health and well-being at the individual and family (micro), community and organization (mezzo), and policy and program (macro) levels. </p>
