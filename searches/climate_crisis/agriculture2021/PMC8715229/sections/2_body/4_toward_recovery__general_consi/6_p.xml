The capacities of countries to deploy fiscal rescue packages and broad social protection measures differ greatly across the world. With governments prioritizing their own national recovery, there is a risk that lack of international cooperation will hamper the sustainability transformations needed for the SDGs and widen the economic and technological gaps between and within regions. The EU, USA, and other advanced economies quickly released unprecedented economic stimulus packages (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cassim et al., 2020</xref>), based on both fiscal and monetary interventions. In 2020 the 50 largest economies committed 14.6 trillion USD in the response to COVID-19 with 1.9 trillion USD focused on long-term economic recovery (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">O'Callaghan and Murdock, 2021</xref>). Developing countries have only limited capacity to do the same and may also have to deal with the devaluation of their currencies, as well as loss of investments and remittances. There is also a question mark behind the willingness of governments to harness the crisis to restructure their economies rather than recovering old structures which may no longer be fit to meet the challenges of changing world. According to <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">O'Callaghan and Murdock (2021)</xref> only 18% of the longer-term recovery spending or 2.5% of the total fiscal spending announced in 2020 is specifically contributing to a green recovery. The recovery is about making deliberate, informed strategic choices, taking into account the potential long-term consequences for the various development paths. In light of the uncertainties and constraints outlined above, it is important that the recovery is informed and guided by the vision of a more resilient and sustainable future.</p>
