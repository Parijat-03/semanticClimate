<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par42">Since the last couple of years, the SBTi has recommended only two of the original seven methods for scope 1 and 2 emission targets (ACA and SDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Bj&#248;rn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] questioned the reasons for the method recommendation based on an initial analysis of emission imbalances<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn17">17</xref> that did not favor the two recommended methods. A broader question is whether companies should be allowed to choose any target-setting method that meets some (yet to be prescribed) criteria or if all companies should use the same method and who gets to decide these criteria or that method. Aden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] considered the availability of multiple methods a strength, arguing that &#8220;there is not a single SBT method that is best in all sectors and company situations.&#8221; Similarly, Faria and Labutong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] encourage practitioners to &#8220;consider the fitness of the method and scenario to the particular use case.&#8221; However, Bj&#248;rn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] showed that global allowable emissions will be substantially overshot if all companies choose the SBT method that result in the least challenging target, as also hypothesized by Freiberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In recognizing this risk, SBTi recommends companies to &#8220;screen several of the methods and choose the method and target that best drives emissions reductions&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the lack of a requirement to disclose the SBT method behind approved targets makes it difficult to know if companies follow this recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Against this backdrop, Lister [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] sees a need for the state to co-regulate SBTs in terms of establishing an SBT standard that defines a consistent methodology, involving a common base year and target year and alignment with national climate policy goals. This proposal addresses the concern of Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]&#160;which companies may deliberately choose base years that result in favorable targets and the observation of Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] that current SBT methods generally do not allow alignment with national climate goals. We note, however, that current national commitments in aggregate are insufficient for meeting the Paris temperature goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (although decreasingly so with the pledges and initiatives announced at COP26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). Therefore, alterations of SBT methods to align with national climate goals may defeat the purpose of SBTs. In addition, alignment with national targets may be impractical for multinational companies.</p>
