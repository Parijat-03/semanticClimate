As a result of the changing climate, populations living along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts will be affected by sea level rise and subsequent land loss, and many inhabitants of the Southeast will experience increasing temperatures and more frequent, intense, and sustained extreme heat events [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further, the region&#8217;s water supply stress due to periodic water shortages is anticipated to increase significantly by 2050, affecting forestry, recreation, manufacturing, agriculture, power generation, and fisheries [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. People living within geographically isolated areas in the Southeast are likely to experience the direct and indirect effects of a changing climate differently, and perhaps more dramatically, than those residing in other areas [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </p>
