Few et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>) identify reorganization and reorientation as two fundamental mechanisms of change in how decisions and actions on adaptation are taken. Reorganization refers explicitly to a major change in governance structures while reorientation refers to a reconfiguration of social values and social relations in adaptation (Few et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). One of the main features of effective adaptation is the ability to coordinate actions at relevant levels which requires effective governance (Jensen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). While some recent developments in global and national climate policies are leading to improvements in adaptation governance, there are still considerable shortcomings.</p>
