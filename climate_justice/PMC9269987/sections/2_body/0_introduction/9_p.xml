We refer to <italic>moral emotions</italic>, as they &#8220;inhibit socially undesirable behavior and foster moral conduct&#8221; (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Tangney, 1995</xref>). For example, in a study by <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Roeser (2012)</xref>, in climate change communication, emotions promoted a better understanding of the moral meaning of climate change in comparison to neutral communication. As a consequence, emotions are a reliable motivator for pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Roeser, 2012</xref>). <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Corral-Verdugo (2013)</xref> even found that emotions have a higher impact on pro-environmental behavior than intentions. More precisely, emotions and intentions together explained more than half of the variance in pro-environmental behavior. In addition, emotions play a vital role in initiating behavioral <italic>change</italic> (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Stoll-Kleemann et al., 2022a</xref>). <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kollmuss and Agyeman (2002)</xref> state in their behavior change model that &#8220;the stronger a person&#8217;s emotional reaction, the more likely that person will engage in a new behavior.&#8221;</p>
