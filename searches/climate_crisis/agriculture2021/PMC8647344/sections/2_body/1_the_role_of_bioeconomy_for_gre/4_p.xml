(2020)</xref>. The additional stimulus can facilitate improvements in agricultural value chains that promote biodiversity and sustainable food systems. These include incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) in production, construction of low-energy buildings and protection of natural assets, and off-grid rural electrification, among others. New business models, new production and consumption patterns, new social norms, and new governance schemes could emerge. Emerging innovations could also support manufacturing and food industries in production (e.g., carbon farming, climate-smart forestry) and processing (e.g., automation of food production with robotics) systems (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, the decentralization of food systems and biorefineries (e.g., by utilizing smart specialization funding schemes that promote the model of &#8220;biocities&#8221;) could secure smallholders, enterprises, farmers, and customers (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
