<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The data analysis is guided by [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] theoretical coding (p. 250), axial coding (p. 244), and open or initial coding (p. 110) with a mix of in vivo coding (p. 105) methods followed by three cycles of analysis. In the first cycle analysis, the needs communicated in NDCs are divided into discrete need patterns following open coding, and specific words or phrases specifying emphasis or critical needs are retained following in vivo coding. The variety of 55 discrete need factors/patterns is then harmonized into 17 axial codes (sub-categories) in the second cycle analysis. In the third cycle of analysis, 17 sub-categories are then aggregated into 7 key categories that structure the conceptual framework of grounded needs guided by theoretical coding. Finally, to facilitate a conceptual framework of needs, 55 need factors and 17 sub-categories of needs are aggregated into 7 key categories. The coding process remained iterative at each stage of analysis (<xref rid="ijerph-19-09941-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and was validated by independent reviewers in a focus group discussion moderated by the author. All the need factors, sub-categories, and categories are discussed one by one to confirm the appropriateness of the wording used in given codes and their relationships and interdependence. NVIVO software is used to code and analyze the data.</p>
