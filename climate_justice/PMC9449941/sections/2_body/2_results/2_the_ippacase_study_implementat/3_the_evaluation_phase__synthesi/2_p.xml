We relied on a set of criteria proposed for the transformation of energy systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], which distinguishes five principal categories that address several dimensions of socio-technical systems and are equipped with corresponding criteria towards urban transport systems:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par36"><italic>Technology development.</italic> This includes criteria such as innovative mobility services, alternative drives for MPT, alternative drives for public transport, and intelligent charging infrastructure.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37"><italic>Sector integration and coupling.</italic> This comprises the criteria of development of intelligent charging infrastructures, and coupling of renewable electricity generation with the energy demand in transport.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38"><italic>Environmental impact.</italic> This includes traditional emissions (air, water, soil, noise), and greenhouse gases.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39"><italic>Social resonance.</italic> This covers issues such as empirically measured willingness-to-accept (technologies, policy measures), and empirically measured consumption and investment behaviour (households, companies).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40"><italic>Institutional factors.</italic> This includes legal barriers (contradictions, inefficiencies, etc.), political barriers (e.g. overlapping competencies, mismatches between vertical governance levels, lobbying, time delays, etc.), spatial barriers, and economic barriers.</p></list-item></list></p>
