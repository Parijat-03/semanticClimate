<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To assess the performance of the model to simulate the observations, a comparison between the measured and simulated yearly daily average concentrations of PM<sub>2.</sub><sub>5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> was conducted for a selected number of stations. This comparison reveals that the measured concentrations are, in general, reproduced when compared against the simulated observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, except for Osorno, a persistent underestimation of the modeled city concentration against the stations&#8217; observations can be noticed. We highlight that the observed value corresponds to the measured concentration at a given point and therefore reflects the air quality at that given location and its surroundings, whereas the city average represents the average of simulated concentrations over an area. Therefore, a persistent underestimation of the measured yearly average by the simulated city yearly average does not suggest difficulties of the model to reproduce the observations, but rather the fact that both have different spatial representativity. Despite this limitation, the model approach was chosen given that the AQ network has a limited number of stations in a select group of cities, thus providing only partial coverage of the air quality in the country. The model provides AQ information for communes not covered by the Chilean monitoring network, allowing the application of the study to a larger fraction of the Chilean population.</p>
