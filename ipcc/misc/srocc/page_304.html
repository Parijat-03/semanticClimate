Livelihood diversi&#64257;cation to collecting and selling &#64257;rewood and charcoal production can exacerbate deforestation (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018). Avoiding maladaptive outcomes can often contribute both to reducing the risks from climate change and combating deserti&#64257;cation (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018). Avoiding, reducing and reversing deserti&#64257;cation would enhance soil fertility, increase carbon storage in soils and biomass, thus reducing carbon emissions from soils to the atmosphere (Section&#160;3.7.2 and Cross-Chapter Box&#160;2&#160;in Chapter&#160;1). In speci&#64257;c locations, there may be barriers for some of these activities. For example, afforestation and reforestation programmes can contribute to reducing sand storms and increasing carbon sinks in dryland regions (Chu et al. 2019) (Sections&#160;3.6.1 and&#160;3.7.2). However, implementing agroforestry measures in arid locations can be constrained by lack of water (Apuri et al. 2018), leading to a&#160;trade-off between soil carbon sequestration and other water uses (Cao et al. 2018). Thus, even when solutions are available, social, economic and institutional constraints could post barriers to their implementation (</span><span style="x0: 139.79; x1: 146.64; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="139.79" y0="531.55" x1="210.14">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 210.14; x1: 212.78; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="210.14" y0="531.55" x1="212.78">)</span><span style="x0: 212.78; x1: 215.06; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="212.78" y0="531.55" x1="216.99">. </span></div><div left="59.24" right="229.62" top="495.01"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 65.48; y0: 495.01; y1: 507.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.24" y0="495.01" x1="229.62">1.7 Hotspots and case studies</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="471.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 471.52; y1: 481.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="471.52" x1="307.29">The challenges of deserti&#64257;cation and climate change in dryland areas across the world often have very location-speci&#64257;c characteristics.

Climate change is projected to increase soil erosion potential in some dryland areas through more frequent heavy rainfall events and rainfall variability (see Section&#160;3.5.2 for a&#160;more detailed assessment) (Achite and Ouillon 2007; Megnounif and Ghenim 2016; Vachtman et al. 2013; Zhang and Nearing 2005). There are numerous soil conservation measures that can help reduce soil erosion (Section&#160;3.6.1). Such soil management measures include afforestation and reforestation activities, rehabilitation of degraded forests, erosion control measures, prevention of overgrazing, diversi&#64257;cation of crop rotations, and improvement in irrigation techniques, especially in sloping areas (Anache et al. 2018; &#199;EMGM 2017; Li and Fang 2016; Poesen 2018; Ziadat and Taimeh 2013).

National assessments conducted in 1979, which examined 46% of the continental surface of the country, concluded that very high levels of soil erosion affected 36% of the territory. The degree of soil erosion increases from south to north. The leading locations in Chile are the region of Coquimbo with 84% of eroded soils (Lat. 29&#176;S, semi-arid climate), the region of Valpara&#237;so with 57% of eroded soils (Lat.&#160;33&#176;S, Mediterranean climate) and the region of&#160;O&#8217;Higgins with 37% of eroded soils (Lat. 34&#176;S, Mediterranean climate). The most important drivers of soil erosion are soil, slope, climate erosivity (i.e., precipitation, intensity, duration and frequency) due to a&#160;highly concentrated rainy season, and vegetation structure and cover. In the region of Coquimbo, goat and sheep overgrazing have aggravated the situation (CIREN 2010).

No-till, in conjunction with the adoption of strategic cover crops, has positively impacted soil biology with increases in soil organic matter. Early evaluations by Crovetto, (1998) showed that no-till application (after seven years) had doubled the biological activity indicators compared to traditional farming and even surpassed those found in pasture (grown for the previous 15&#160;years). Besides erosion control, additional bene&#64257;ts are an increase of water-holding capacity and reduction in bulk density. Currently, the above no-till farm experiment has lasted for 40 years and continues to report bene&#64257;ts to soil health and sustainable production (Reicosky and Crovetto 2014). The in&#64258;uence of this iconic farm has resulted in the adoption of soil conservation practices&#160;&#8211; and especially no-till&#160;&#8211; in dryland areas of the Mediterranean climate region of central Chile (Mart&#237;nez et al. 2011). Currently, it has been estimated that the area under no-till farming in Chile varies between&#160;0.13 and&#160;0.2 Mha (Acevedo and Silva 2003).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="542.93" top="183.42"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.56; y0: 183.42; y1: 193.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="183.42" x1="542.93">1.7.1.3 Combating wind erosion and de&#64258;ation in Turkey: The&#160;greening desert of Karap&#305;nar</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="147.52"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 320.06; y0: 147.52; y1: 157.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="147.52" x1="565.81">In Turkey, the amount of sediment recently released through erosion into seas was estimated to be 168 Mt yr</span><span style="x0: 472.34; x1: 475.66; y0: 139.44; y1: 146.09; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="472.34" y0="139.44" x1="478.86">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 478.86; x1: 481.13; y0: 135.52; y1: 145.02; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="478.86" y0="135.52" x1="565.81">, which is considerably lower than the 500 Mt yr</span><span style="x0: 415.23; x1: 418.56; y0: 127.44; y1: 134.09; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="415.23" y0="127.44" x1="421.75">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 425.49; x1: 428.3; y0: 123.52; y1: 133.02; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="425.49" y0="123.52" x1="565.83">that was estimated to be lost in the 1970s.&#160;The decrease in erosion rates is attributed to an increase in spatial extent of forests, rehabilitation of degraded forests, erosion control, prevention of overgrazing, and improvement in irrigation technologies.
