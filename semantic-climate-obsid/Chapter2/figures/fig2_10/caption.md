![[fig2_10.png]]Figure 2.10 Different perspectives on historic emissions and equity

Panel a shows the regional proportion (%) of total global population or emissions in 2018 or 2019, for fivcategories: population (persons), consumption-based CO2-FFI emissions (GtCO2), production-based CO2-FFI emissions (GtCO2), production-based GHG emissions excluding CO2-LULUCF (GtCO2eq), and production-based GHG emissions including CO2-LULUCF (GtCO2eq). 

Panel b shows the regional proportion (%) of total cumulative production-based CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019, including and excluding CO2-LULUCF (GtCO2). In the lower panels the proportion of each population or emissions category attributable to Least Developed Countries is shown, where available (CO2-LULUCF data is not available for this region). GHG emissions are converted into CO2-equivalents based on global warming potentials with a 100 year time horizon (GWP-100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al., 2021a).
