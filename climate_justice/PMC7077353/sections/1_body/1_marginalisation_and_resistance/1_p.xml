<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In our discussion, we examine the ways in which the norms and practices emanating from the dominant socio-political classes in Bangladesh, which &#8220;disparage, stereotype, exclude, ridicule and demean certain social groups&#8221; (Kabeer <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; see also Kelkar <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), are extended towards indigenous peoples, particularly Santals, in the country. Evidence of Santal resistance to marginalisation processes is presented, followed by socio-economic data which nevertheless demonstrates the serious consequences of marginalisation for Santali development indicators. Sex-disaggregated data compares the situation of low and middle-income ethnic Bengali women and men to that of Santali in the same locations. This overview provides contextual information within which our research data can be assessed and understood. The special focus on Santals, rather than an equal focus on ethnic Bengali and Santals, is necessary to highlight additional features that serve to marginalise Santals. These do not apply to ethnic Bengalis.</p>
