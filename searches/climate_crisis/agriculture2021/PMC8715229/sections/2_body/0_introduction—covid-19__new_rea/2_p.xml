The pandemic, which is causing loss of life and personal grief, as well as wreaking havoc on health and economic systems, revealed our global interdependencies and vulnerabilities. During the height of the crisis in 2020, it was estimated that the global economy contracted by 3.3% (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">IMF, 2021</xref>). For the first time in years, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty level has been rising again with estimates suggesting that an additional 88 million to 115 million people in 2020 suffered extreme poverty due to the pandemic (<xref rid="bb0695" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2020a</xref>). The pandemic exacerbated the increases in food insecurity observed over recent years (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020a</xref>). While in 2021 the global economy is expected to grow by 5.4%, the recovery from the recession is uneven by countries and economic output is expected to stay below the projections before the pandemic (<xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2021</xref>). In this reset of economic activities, a continued emphasis on the transformation of food systems will be pivotal for setting the world onto a path toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (<xref rid="bb0570" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015a</xref>) and the objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (<xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015b</xref>).</p>
