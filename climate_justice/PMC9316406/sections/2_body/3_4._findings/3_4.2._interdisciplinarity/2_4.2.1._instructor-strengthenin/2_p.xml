Regarding mezzo-level practice, social work agencies can provide work-related opportunities for staff to engage with other community-based agencies outside the traditional social work scope. This interdisciplinary cooperation will create mutual benefits from each agency&#8217;s expertise and resources to identify the urgent and/or rooted issues and provide target solutions. GSW framework fosters a more nuanced understanding for the trainees towards the broader context of social work practice. This extended understanding encourages the students/trainees to re-examine their previous practice expertise and further apply a more holistic approach to addressing community inhabitants&#8217; health and well-being. For instance, the trainee realized that in relation to climate-induced disasters, as one of the most vulnerable groups, children&#8217;s health and well-being are always negatively affected. She developed a disaster-aware approach to more actively put the GSW framework into her scope of practice in counseling those inhibited by eco-anxiety. She also trained other child welfare workers in her agency and other agencies to equip the staff to become &#8220;disaster responders,&#8221; prepared to respond to environment-related crises, and be aware of environmental injustice. The multifaceted influences on child welfare motivate her to frequently communicate with other professionals (e.g., psychologists and environmental sociologists) to develop interdisciplinary strategies.</p>
