      <td>Box TS.13, Figure 1 | Global and regional monsoons: past trends and projected changes. The intent of this figure is to show changes in precipitation over\nregional monsoon domains in terms of observed past trends, how greenhouse gases and aerosols relate to these changes, and in terms of future projections in one\nintermediate emissions scenario in the near, medium and long term. (a) Global (black contour) and regional monsoons (colour shaded) domains. The global monsoon\n(GM) is defined as the area with local summer-minus-winter precipitation rate exceeding 2.5 mm day&#8211;1 (see Annex V). The regional monsoon domains are defined\nbased on published literature and expert judgement (see Annex V) and accounting for the fact that the climatological summer monsoon rainy season varies across\nthe individual regions. Assessed regional monsoons are South and South East Asia (SAsiaM, Jun&#8211;July&#8211;August&#8211;September), East Asia (EAsiaM, June&#8211;July&#8211;August),\nWest Africa (WAfriM, June&#8211;July&#8211;August&#8211;September), North America (NAmerM, July&#8211;August&#8211;-September), South America (SAmerM, December&#8211;January&#8211;February),\nAustralia and Maritime Continent Monsoon (AusMCM, December&#8211;January&#8211;February). Equatorial South America (EqSAmer) and South Africa (SAfri) regions are also\nshown, as they receive unimodal summer seasonal rainfall although their qualification as monsoons is subject to discussion. (b) Global and regional monsoons\nprecipitation trends based on DAMIP CMIP6 simulations with both natural and anthropogenic (ALL), greenhouse gas only (GHG), aerosols only (AER) and natural\nonly (NAT) radiative forcing. Weighted ensemble means are based on nine Coupled model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models contributing to the MIP\n(with at least three members). Observed trends computed from CRU, GPCP and APHRO (only for SAsiaM and EAsiaM) datasets are shown as well. (c) Percentage\nchange in projected seasonal mean precipitation over global and regional monsoons domain in the near term (2021&#8211;2040), mid-term (2041&#8211;2060), and long term\n(2081&#8211;2100) under SSP2-4.5 based on 24 CMIP6 models. {Figures 8.11 and 8.22}</td>
