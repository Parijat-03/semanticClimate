These two kinds of energy resources have pros and cons for carbon emissions control. Although renewable energy has been considered the best way to keep carbon neutrality, there is a side effect of carbon production. In the case of photosynthesis, the carbon is transformed into a stable chemical compound (Stile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>). However, during the burring, carbons are released into the atmosphere. It is required to manage the side effect of renewable energy, which is described in the modeling.</p>
