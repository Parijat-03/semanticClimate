The planning of the original park, funded by the New Deal&#8217;s Works Progress Administration (Wye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2020</xref>), commissioned by Robert Moses, and built by Mayor La Guardia&#8217;s administration in 1939, made no attempts at a democratic process or public input. A New York Times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1939</xref>) article announcing the park&#8217;s inauguration described how city agencies cleared local &#8220;slums,&#8221; reclaimed land from the East River to expand Manhattan&#8217;s buildable area, and strengthened the coastal edge with a new seawall. The public amenity and seawall represented a classic example of urban renewal and symbolized the hard&#160;mid-twentieth century modern division between city and water &#8211; between society and nature &#8211; with the assumption that the climate would remain stable forever and that the ocean would never encroach on the city. The death and damage from Superstorm Sandy painted a different image of the future and injected urgency into efforts to adapt to a changed climate. Now the debate over East River Park is a site to observe whether New York and cities like it around the world will reproduce their decision-making styles from the mid-twentieth century or take a different route altogether, and with what effects.</p>
