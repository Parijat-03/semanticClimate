<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While literature reviews play an important role in building foundational knowledge, these reviews also allude to the need to take this knowledge further and foster a deeper understanding around children and youths&#8217; responses to climate change. This research points to the importance of continuing to identify and consolidate the available evidence on the direct, indirect, and mediated impacts of climate change on children and youth&#8217;s mental and physical health, and on what protective factors and health promoting interventions can prevent and mitigate against these impacts [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, it is important to cultivate work that looks at addressing local climate issues in the context of cities, rural, remote, northern, island, and traditional territory community contexts; conducting research and community-based climate actions not only for children and youth, but with them. It also calls for integrating findings into future policies and practices to build capacity in the mental healthcare sector in Canada by integrating mental health support into existing healthcare facilities and programs. This is particularly important in rural and remote communities with limited mental health programming and funding. Other questions which are important to answer include: 1. How can local actions on climate change promote and protect children and youth&#8217;s health and wellbeing? and 2. What factors make these actions attributable to improvements in mental health and wellbeing?</p>
