(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>) provided another environmental analysis for Australia&#8217;s GHG emissions over the period 1990&#8211;2015. The researchers combined LMDI decomposition analysis with Tapio&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) decoupling method in their study. Their findings revealed that two of Australia&#8217;s economic structures, agriculture and commercial services, exhibited strong decoupling, whereas the remaining sectors showed weak decoupling. Regarding the decomposition analysis, the researchers evaluated the impacts of five factors on GHGs, namely, economic activity, economic share, energy emissions, energy intensity, and GHG intensity. Marques et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>) concluded that Australia successfully reduced the level of GHG emissions. They also highlighted that construction and agriculture sectors were the most and least efficient sectors in terms of the efficiency of economic activities, respectively.</p>
