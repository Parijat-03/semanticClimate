The study indicated that these are due to differences in conceptualisations and choice of indicators, biases in study site selection, differences in methods, varying measurement accuracy, differences in time and spatial scales. High-resolution, multi-sensor airborne platforms provide a&#160;way to address some of these issues (Asner et al. 2012).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="627.54"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 627.54; y1: 637.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="627.54" x1="307.29">The major conclusion of this section is that, with all the shortcomings of individual case studies, relative roles of climatic and human drivers of deserti&#64257;cation are location-speci&#64257;c and evolve over time (</span><span style="x0: 289.19; x1: 293.77; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="289.19" y0="603.54" x1="307.3">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 98.13; x1: 100.77; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="98.13" y0="591.54" x1="307.27">).

Thus, the sensible heat (heat that causes the atmospheric temperature to rise) accounts for more of the surface net radiation than latent heat (evaporation) in these regions (Wang&#160;and Dickinson 2013). This tight coupling between the surface energy balance and the soil moisture in semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones makes these regions susceptible to land&#8211;atmosphere feedback loops that can amplify changes to the water cycle (Seneviratne et al. 2010). Changes to the land surface caused by deserti&#64257;cation can change the surface energy budget, altering the soil moisture and triggering these feedbacks.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="195.91" top="147.42"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.44; y0: 147.42; y1: 157.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.24" y0="147.42" x1="195.91">1.3.1 Sand and dust aerosols</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.31" top="123.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 123.52; y1: 133.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="123.52" x1="307.31">Sand and mineral dust are frequently mobilised from sparsely vegetated drylands forming &#8216;sand storms&#8217; or &#8216;dust storms&#8217; (UNEP&#160;et al. 2016).

These events can play an important role in the local energy balance. Through reducing vegetation cover and drying the surface conditions, deserti&#64257;cation can increase the frequency of these events. Biological or structural soil crusts have been shown to effectively stabilise dryland soils. Thus their loss due to intense land use and/or climate change can be expected to cause an increase in sand and dust storms (</span><span style="x0: 366.85; x1: 371.43; y0: 663.55; y1: 673.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="366.85" y0="663.55" x1="425.01">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 425.01; x1: 427.65; y0: 663.55; y1: 673.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="425.01" y0="663.55" x1="565.84">) (Rajot et al. 2003; Field et al. 2010; Rodriguez-Caballero et al. 2018). These sand and dust aerosols impact the regional climate in several ways (Choobari et al. 2014). The direct effect is the interception, re&#64258;ection and absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere, reducing the energy available at the land surface and increasing the temperature of the atmosphere in layers with sand and dust present (Kaufman et al. 2002; Middleton 2017; Kok et al. 2018). The heating of the dust layer can alter the relative humidity and atmospheric stability, which can change cloud lifetimes and water content. This has been referred to as the semi-direct effect (Huang et al. 2017). Aerosols also have an indirect effect on climate through their role as cloud condensation nuclei, changing cloud radiative properties as well as the evolution and development of precipitation (Kaufman et al. 2002). While these indirect effects are more variable than the direct effects, depending on the types and amounts of aerosols present, the general tendency is toward an increase in the number, but a&#160;reduction in the size of cloud droplets, increasing the cloud re&#64258;ectivity and decreasing the chances of precipitation. These effects are referred to as aerosol-radiation and aerosol&#8211;cloud interactions (Boucher et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="350.82" top="411.59"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 321.99; y0: 411.59; y1: 421.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="411.59" x1="350.82">There is </span><span style="x0: 354.0; x1: 358.58; y0: 411.59; y1: 421.09; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="354.0" y0="411.59" x1="416.47">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 419.65; x1: 422.46; y0: 411.59; y1: 421.09; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="419.65" y0="411.59" x1="565.83">that there is a&#160;negative relationship between vegetation green-up and the occurrence of dust storms (Engelstaedter et al. 2003; Fan et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2015; Zou and Zhai 2004). Changes in groundwater can affect vegetation and the generation of atmospheric dust (Elmore et al. 2008). This can occur through groundwater processes such as the vertical movement of salt to the surface causing salinisation, supply of near-surface soil moisture, and sustenance of groundwater dependent vegetation. Groundwater dependent ecosystems have been identi&#64257;ed in many dryland regions around the world (Decker et al. 2013; Lamontagne et al. 2005; Patten et al. 2008). In these locations declining groundwater levels can decrease vegetation cover. Cook et al.
