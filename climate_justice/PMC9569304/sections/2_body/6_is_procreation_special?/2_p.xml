The objection could state that one can also meet the fundamental interest in parenting by adopting. Moreover, several philosophers have argued that we have a duty to adopt instead of raising biological children.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn38">38</xref> However, there is no consensus in the literature on this matter, and some philosophers have pushed back against this claim. For example, Luara Ferracioli has developed an accounts of how procreative parenting is relevantly distinct from adoptive parenting.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn39">39</xref> And Rivka Weinberg has argued against adoption being morally superior than procreative parenting because adoption is often a solution to a problem for which better solutions are available, such as enabling biological parents to care for their children.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn40">40</xref> Independently of how one judges these arguments, it is important to highlight that children who would benefit from being adopted have also been created by procreative acts; so independently of what our obligations are regarding adoption, we need procreation if we want to secure the capability of parenting for all. Thus, even if those who want to parent were to have a duty to adopt, it would not undermine the capabilitarian argument or the argument from human self-understanding; rather, it would form a separate set of considerations that have to be taken into account when considering the ethics of procreation.</p>
