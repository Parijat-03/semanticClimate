      <td>In the mid-2000s, governments, food industries, NGOs, and\ninternational programmes joined forces to put in place\nimportant initiatives to respond to the growing concerns\nabout the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion\nin the region (Negra et al. 2014; Finer et al. 2018). Brazil\nled regional action by launching the Interministerial Plan of\nAction for Prevention and Control of Deforestation of the\nLegal Amazon2 (PPCDAm), associated with development\nof a real-time deforestation warning system. Further, Brazil\nbuilt capacity to respond to alerts by coordinated efforts of\nministries, the federal police, the army and public prosecution\n(Negra et al. 2014; Finer et al. 2018).</td>

In 2012, Brazil also created the national land\nregistry system (SICAR), a georeferenced database, which\nallows monitoring of farms&#8217; environmental liability in order\nto grant access to rural credit. Besides the governmental\nschemes, funding agencies and the Amazon Fund provide\nfinancial resources to assist smallholder farmers to comply\nwith environmental regulations (Jung et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>Nevertheless, Azevedo et al. (2017) argue that the full\npotential of these financial incentives has not been achieved,\ndue to weak enforcement mechanisms and limited supporting\npublic policies. Agricultural expansion and intensification\nhave complex interactions with deforestation. While\nmechanisms have been implemented in the region to protect\nnative forests and ecosystems, control of deforestation rates\nrequire stronger governance of natural resources (Ceddia\net al. 2013 and Oliveira and Hecht 2016), including monitoring\nprogrammes to evaluate fully the results of land-use policies\nin the region.</td>

      <td>Public and private sector actions resulted in a reduction of the\nBrazilian legal Amazon deforestation rate from 2.78 Mha yr&#8211;1\nin 2004, to about 0.75 Mha yr&#8211;1 (ca. 0.15%) in 2009 (INPE\n2015), oscillating from 0.46 Mha and 0.79 Mha (2016) since\nthen (INPE 2018; Boucher and Chi 2018). The governmental\nforest protection scheme was also expanded to other biomes.\nAs a result, the Brazilian Cerrado deforestation was effectively\nreduced from 2.9 Mha yr&#8211;1 in 2004 to an average of 0.71 Mha\nyr&#8211;1 in 2016&#8211;2017 (INPE 2018).</td>

      <td>Overall, deforestation rates in South America have declined\nsignificantly, with current deforestation rates being about\nhalf of rates in the early 2000s (FAOSTAT 2018). However,\ninconsistent conservation policies across countries\n(Gibbs et al. 2015) and recent hiccups (Curtis et al. 2018)\nindicate that deforestation control still requires stronger\nreinforcement mechanisms (Tollefson 2018). Further, there\nare important spill-over effects that need coordinated\ninternational governance. Curtis et al. (2018) and Dou et al.\n(2018) point out that, although the Amazon deforestation\nrate decreased in Brazil, it has increased in other regions,\nparticularly in South Asia, and in other countries in South\nAmerica, resulting in nearly constant deforestation rates\nworldwide.</td>

Yet, higher crop productivity was not\nenough to meet growing demand for cereals and oilseeds\nand cultivation continued to expand, mainly on grasslands\n(Richards 2015). The reconciliation of this expansion with\nhigher demand for meat and dairy products was carried out\nthrough the intensification of livestock systems (Martha et al.\n2012).
