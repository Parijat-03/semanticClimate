<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our data show that Santal women are beginning to flip the first three drivers of marginalisation to their advantage. They are using their agency to turn the tables on their identity-based exclusion through securing access to assets, services and institutional governance processes in relation to wheat&#8211;maize innovations, and that they have achieved this in a very short time. The data further shows that low-income Muslim women involved in field-based agriculture are seizing the opportunities first opened by the Kalipara Union Federation and Santal women in order to insert themselves into these empowerment processes. This includes setting up further women-led networks &#8211; for example, the low-income Muslim woman who organised a learning group of 25 women in her community. Whilst Muslim and Santal women do not share all the features of horizontal group-based forms of marginalisation (see Figures A1 and A2), they share sufficient features to enable cooperation along specific trajectories. For example, low-income Muslim and Santal women are engaged in field agriculture, have the same household responsibilities and the same interests in securing income, but both groups have long been excluded from training on field crops.</p>
