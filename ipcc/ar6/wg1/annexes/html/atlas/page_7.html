It expands on and integrates results from other WGI chapters and recent 8 literature to provide summaries of observed and relevant regional/local climate phenomena, historical 9 simulations and projected future climate change across different scales. It includes the description of an 10 online interactive tool (the Interactive Atlas), which allows for a flexible spatial and temporal analysis of 11 these results. One specific focus for the summaries is providing information on climatic impact drivers and 12 hazards relevant to sectoral and regional chapters of the WGII report, being informed by and complementing 13 the work of Chapter 12 in creating a bridge to Working Group II (WGII). Similarly, a specific aim of the 14 integration is synthesising information drawn from across multiple chapters that is relevant to the WGII 15 report and the mitigation and sectoral chapters of the Working Group III (WGIII) report. Finally, the Atlas 16 also assesses approaches to communication of climate information, illustrated with case studies and guidance 17 on how to interpret them. 18 19 An overview of the main components of the Atlas Chapter is provided in Figure Atlas.1:. 20 21 22 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 492.47; y1: 503.45; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="492.47" x1="210.41">[START Figure Atlas.1: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="492.47" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 492.47; y1: 503.45; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23 24 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 468.38; y1: 478.4; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="468.38" x1="123.38">Figure Atlas.1: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="468.38" x1="495.68" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 133.74; y0: 468.38; y1: 478.4; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The main components of the Atlas Chapter with, bottom right, a screenshot from the online </span><span x0="27.66" y0="468.17" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 468.17; y1: 479.15; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">25 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="456.86" x1="198.95" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 130.96; y0: 456.86; y1: 466.88; width: 3.34; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Interactive Atlas. </span><span x0="27.66" y0="456.65" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 456.65; y1: 467.63; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">26 27 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 431.51; y1: 442.49; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="431.51" x1="196.91">[END Figure Atlas.1: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="431.51" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 431.51; y1: 442.49; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">28 29 30 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 393.53; y1: 404.51; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="393.53" x1="203.83">Atlas.1.2 Context and framing </span><span x0="27.66" y0="393.53" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 393.53; y1: 404.51; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">31 32 Information on global and regional climate change in the form of maps, tables, graphs and infographics has 33 always been a key output of IPCC reports. With the consensus that climate has changed and will continue to 34 do so, policymakers are focusing more on understanding the implications which often requires an increase in 35 regional and temporal details of observed and future climate. In response, the AR5 included in the WGI 36 contribution a globally comprehensive coverage of land regions and some oceanic regions in the Atlas of 37 Global and Regional Climate Projections (Annex I), focusing on projected changes in temperature and 38 precipitation. In the WGII contribution, the Regional Context Chapter (21) included continental scale maps 39 of observed and future temperature and precipitation changes, subcontinental changes in high percentiles of 40 daily temperature and precipitation, and a table of changes in extremes over subcontinental regions (updating 41 an assessment in the SREX report). However, there was only limited coordination between these two 42 contributions despite the largely common data sources and their relevance across the two working groups 43 and to wider communities of climate change-related policy and practice. This resulted in inefficiencies and 44 the potential for confusing or inconsistent messages which the Atlas, with its links with other WGI/II/III 45 chapters, is designed to address. 46 47 Given the aims of the Atlas, there are several important factors to consider. There is a clear requirement for 48 climate change information over a wide range of &#8216;regions&#8217;, and classes thereof, and temporal scales. There is 49 also often the need for integrated information relevant for policy, practice and awareness raising. However, 50 most other chapters in WGI are disciplinary, focusing on specific processes in the climate system or on its 51 past or future behaviour, and have limited space to be spatially and temporally comprehensive. The Atlas 52 provides an opportunity to facilitate this integration and exploration of information. 53 54 Developing this information often requires a broad range of data sources (various observations, global and 55 </span></div></body></html>
