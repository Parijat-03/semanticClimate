However, the people who will suffer the greatest burden, including the worst health risks, are those who have historically contributed the least to climate change&#8212;namely, those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and small island developing states.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Children (under 18 years old), adolescents (aged 10&#8211;19), and youth (aged 15&#8211;24) are among those most heavily affected.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In this paper, unless otherwise specified, the term &#8220;young people&#8221; refers to children, adolescents, and youth. The 2019 <italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> Countdown report shows how young people disproportionately bear the impacts of climate change, both physically and psychologically.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition to affecting their health, climate change threatens children&#8217;s rights to education, food, and recreation, among others.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Given that young people are inherently less responsible for climate change than their adult contemporaries, climate change is defined by the Human Rights Council as the &#8220;most significant intergenerational injustice of our time.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
