on the other hand, highly productive soils have experienced the highest rate of conversion of any soil type (Nizeyimana et&#160;al. 2001). Speci&#64257;c types of agriculture are often practiced in urban-in&#64258;uenced fringes, such as fruits, vegetables, and poultry and eggs in the USA, the loss of which can have an impact on the types of nutritious foods available in urban areas (Francis et&#160;al. 2012). China is also concerned with food security implications of urban sprawl, and a loss of 30 Mt of grain production from 1998 to 2003 in eastern China was attributed to urbanisation (Chen 2007).

When these early warning systems can help farmers harvest crops in advance of impending weather events, or otherwise make agricultural decisions to prepare for adverse events, there are likely to be positive impacts on food security (Fakhruddin et&#160;al. 2015). Surveys with farmers reporting food insecurity from climate impacts have indicated their strong interest in having such early warning systems (Shisanya and Mafongoya 2016). Additionally, famine early warning systems have been successful in Sahelian Africa to alert authorities of impending food shortages so that food acquisition and transportation from outside the region can begin, potentially helping millions of people (Genesio et&#160;al. 2011; Hillbruner and Moloney 2012).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="195.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 195.6; y1: 205.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="195.6" x1="566.1">Risk-sharing instruments are often aimed at sharing food supplies and reducing risk, and thus are likely to have important, but unquanti&#64257;ed, bene&#64257;ts for food security.
