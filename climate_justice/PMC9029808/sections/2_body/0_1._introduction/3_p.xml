For example, women living in rural communities in the Global South who subsume most household duties and endure longer distances outdoors for the collection of water and food due to climate-induced food and water insecurity, face increased exposure to overheating, air and water contamination, and are subject to greater risk of gender-based violence during their commute [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Evidence shows that pregnant women and newborns are significantly threatened by heatwaves and air pollution, causing higher chances of miscarriages, preterm birth, and poorer neonatal outcomes, as well as food insecurity, leading to undernutrition among pregnant women [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This increases the likelihood of children suffering from low birth weight, one of the main risk factors for infant mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. UNICEF estimates that over 1 billion children, half of today&#8217;s children, live in countries at extremely high risk of climate change, which puts their survival in jeopardy, specifically by undernutrition, air pollution, and diseases [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This severely affects children&#8217;s mortality and morbidity, with high expectations of rising cases of diarrhea and pneumonia [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even under current emission reduction pledges scenarios, a person born in 2020 is going to experience a two- to sevenfold increase in weather events, especially heatwaves, compared to those born in the 1960s, which will have profound impacts on their development and well-being [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
