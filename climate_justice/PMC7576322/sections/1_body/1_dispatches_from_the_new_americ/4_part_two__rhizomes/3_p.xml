<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0070">Through Nicole&#8217;s account, Rush details the science behind why communities, such as the east side of Staten Island, are vulnerable to extreme weather events like Sandy. Rush describes the compounding nature of how population increases in post-World-War-Two New York pushed people to develop communities further out on former tidal marshes. While this afforded them the ability to own their own property, the location of their land meant that they would be vulnerable to the first signs of climate change, a concept that would fail to become a part of the social zeitgeist for decades. Equally challenging is that solutions to relocating people away from vulnerable areas are complicated and require buy-in from members of the community who ultimately have to be the ones to make the decision to leave. Rhizomes, in this case, refer both to the interconnected and subterranean root systems of cordgrass that define a healthy tidal marsh, as well as the social fabric that binds communities together. Implementing policies to solve the impacts of climate change is going to require us to consider not just the scientific measures to take, but what those measures mean to the communities impacted by the crisis and the solutions to the crisis.</p>
