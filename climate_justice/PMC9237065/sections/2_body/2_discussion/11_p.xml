First, it identified the particular relevance of path dependency, i.e., the notion that policy decisions once made within a certain frame tend to stick to that frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which guides our choice of past EU effort-sharing regulation in one approach to derive negotiation convergence points. Second, the governance literature identifies the relevance of timely transparent information. In particular, the 2019/2021 EU decision of implementing to remain within a Paris compatible carbon budget in combination with the Corona-aftermath and &#8220;building back better&#8221; may represent a critical juncture in institutional development, at which &#8220;decisions of important actors are causally decisive for the selection of one path of institutional development over other possible paths&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and conflict over ideas has been identified as important for institutional change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The approach we present is intended to contribute to resolving conflicts over equity perspectives to allow for institutional development.</p>
