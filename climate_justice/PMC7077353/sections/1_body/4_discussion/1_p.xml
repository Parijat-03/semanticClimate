<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As mentioned earlier, the hypothesis guiding the research and analysis of the GENNOVATE data is that although wheat&#8211;maize innovations are directed at middle-income male farmers, women from different income classes and ethnicities are seeking inclusion. The research set out to determine: (1) the strategies women develop to participate in innovation processes as individuals and through organisations; and (2) the benefits women gain from securing inclusion. We now ascertain the degree to which the hypothesis and research questions have been answered. In the Conclusion we set our findings in the overall context of the SDGs and the ambition to &#8220;leave no one behind&#8221;.</p>
