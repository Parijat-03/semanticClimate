They also use proxy information rather than explicit data representing anthropogenic heat release. Other studies have explored these relationships. For example, Kenaway et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)'s analysis of 21 middle Eastern cities reported reductions in nocturnal surface UHI during lockdowns. Results were inconclusive during daytime hours. Chakraborty et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) did find a reduction in the daytime surface UHI in their analysis of 300 urban clusters in India. This collection of studies, including Liu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), establishes the possibility that lockdowns (or other sustained periods of reduced human activity) may be reasonable proxies for anthropogenic waste heat. The studies also further amplify the logic that UHI mitigation strategies must consider the waste heat term. <italic toggle="yes">Why does this all of this ultimately matter?</italic>
