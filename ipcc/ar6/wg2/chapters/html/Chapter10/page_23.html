Restoration of reefs (Nanajkar et&#160;al., 2019) and building resilience through multiple mechanisms, such as innovative policy combinations, complemented by environmental technology innovations and sustained investment (Hilmi et&#160;al., 2019; McLeod et&#160;al., 2019), are suggested.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.9" top="234.62"><span x0="318.19" y0="234.62" x1="571.9" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.65; y0: 234.62; y1: 244.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An ecosystem-based approach to managing coral reefs in the Gulf of Thailand is needed to identify appropriate marine protected area (MPA) networks and to strengthen marine and coastal resource policies in order to build coral reef resilience (Sutthacheep et&#160;al., 2013). Broadening the scope to develop novel mitigation approaches towards coral protection through the use of symbiotic bacteria and their metabolites (Motone et&#160;al., 2018; Motone et&#160;al., 2020) has been suggested. Coral culture and transplantation within the Gulf are feasible for helping maintain coral species populations and preserving genomes and adaptive capacities of Gulf corals that are endangered by future thermal-stress events (Coles and Riegl, 2013). Greater focus on understanding the flexibility and adaptability of people associated with coral reefs, especially in a time of rapid global change (Hoegh-Guldberg et&#160;al., 2019), and a well-designed research programme for developing a more targeted policy agenda (Lam et&#160;al., 2019), is also recommended.
