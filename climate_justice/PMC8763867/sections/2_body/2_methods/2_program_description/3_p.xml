<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In planning this workshop, we gained buy-in from the participating institutions by reaching out to local residency program directors and key health equity&#8211;oriented faulty members to explain the objectives of the workshop and the utility of community organizing for residents. We worked with the program directors to select a date that preceded intern orientation for the majority of the programs so that the workshop occurred before the start of clinical activities. We recruited participants by sending an email flyer to the program directors, who then disseminated it to their incoming interns after Match Day. One residency program made the event a mandatory component of its intern orientation, but for all others, the event was opt-in. We did not give continuing medical education or other credit for participation.</p>
