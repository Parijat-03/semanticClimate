The &#64257;rst is &#8216;deserti&#64257;cation syndrome&#8217; which describes the vicious cycle of resource degradation and poverty, whereby dryland populations apply unsustainable agricultural practices leading to deserti&#64257;cation, and exacerbating their poverty, which then subsequently further limits their capacities to invest in SLM (MEA 2005; Safriel and Adeel 2008). The alternative paradigm is one of &#8216;drylands development&#8217;, which refers to social and technical ingenuity of dryland populations as a&#160;driver of dryland sustainability (MEA 2005; Reynolds et al. 2007; Safriel and Adeel 2008). The major difference between these two frameworks is that the &#8216;drylands development&#8217; paradigm recognises that human activities are not the sole and/or most important drivers of deserti&#64257;cation, but there are interactions of human and climatic drivers within coupled social-ecological systems (Reynolds et al. 2007). This led Behnke and Mortimore (2016), and earlier Swift (1996), to conclude that the concept of deserti&#64257;cation as irreversible degradation distorts policy and governance in dryland areas. Mortimore (2016) suggested that instead of externally imposed technical solutions, what is needed is for populations in dryland areas to adapt to this variable environment which they cannot control.
