In that sense, adaptation limits vary from place to place and are dif&#64257;cult to generalise (Barnett et al. 2015; Dow et al. 2013; Klein et al. 2015). Currently, there is a&#160;lack of knowledge on adaptation limits and potential maladaptation to combined effects of climate change and deserti&#64257;cation (see Section&#160;4.8.6 for discussion on resilience, thresholds, and irreversible land degradation, also relevant for deserti&#64257;cation). However, the potential for residual risks (those risks which remain after adaptation efforts were taken, irrespective of whether they are tolerable or not, tolerability being a&#160;subjective concept) and maladaptive outcomes is high (</span><span style="x0: 246.13; x1: 250.71; y0: 147.55; y1: 157.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="246.13" y0="147.55" x1="306.38">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 306.38; x1: 309.02; y0: 147.55; y1: 157.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="306.38" y0="147.55" x1="313.23">). Some examples of residual risks are illustrated below in this section. Although SLM measures can help lessen the effects of droughts, they cannot fully prevent water stress in crops and resulting lower yields (Eekhout and de Vente 2019). Moreover, although in many cases SLM measures can help reduce and reverse deserti&#64257;cation, there would still be short-term losses in land productivity. Irreversible forms of land degradation (for example, loss of topsoil, severe </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="339.56"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.29; y0: 339.56; y1: 349.06; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="339.56" x1="571.76">gully erosion) can lead to the complete loss of land productivity. Even when solutions are available, their costs could be prohibitive, presenting the limits to adaptation (Dixon et al. 2013). If warming in dryland areas surpasses human thermal physiological thresholds (Klein et al. 2015; Waha et al. 2013), adaptation could eventually fail (Kamali et al. 2018). Catastrophic shifts in ecosystem functions and services (for example coastal erosion (Chen et al. 2015; Schneider and K&#233;&#64257; 2016) (Section&#160;4.9.8)) and economic factors can also result in adaptation failure (Evans et al. 2015). Despite the availability of numerous options that contribute to combating deserti&#64257;cation, climate change adaptation and mitigation, there are also chances of maladaptive actions (</span><span style="x0: 414.63; x1: 421.49; y0: 207.58; y1: 217.08; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="414.63" y0="207.58" x1="486.33">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 486.33; x1: 488.97; y0: 207.58; y1: 217.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="486.33" y0="207.58" x1="571.77">) (see Glossary). Some activities favouring agricultural intensi&#64257;cation in dryland areas can become maladaptive due to their negative impacts on the environment (</span><span style="x0: 375.34; x1: 382.19; y0: 171.58; y1: 181.08; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="375.34" y0="171.58" x1="446.99">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 446.99; x1: 449.63; y0: 171.58; y1: 181.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="446.99" y0="171.58" x1="571.77">). Agricultural expansion to meet food demands can come through deforestation and consequent diminution of carbon sinks (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Stringer et al. 2012). Agricultural insurance programmes encouraging higher agricultural productivity and measures for agricultural intensi&#64257;cation can result in detrimental environmental outcomes in some settings (Guodaar et al. 2019; M&#252;ller et al. 2017) (Table&#160;6.12). Development of more drought-tolerant crop varieties is considered as a&#160;strategy for adaptation to shortening rainy seasons, but this can also lead to a&#160;loss of local varieties (Al Hamndou and Requier-Desjardins </span></div><div left="79.37" right="183.86" top="723.73"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.93; y0: 723.73; y1: 732.23; width: 4.56; font-size: 8.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="79.37" y0="723.73" x1="183.86">Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.54" top="699.52"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.94; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="699.52" x1="557.54">policies aimed at improving water use ef&#64257;ciency in different sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture and industry, or public&#160;advocacy campaigns raising societal awareness and bringing about behavioural change to reduce wasteful water consumption in the residential sector are among such drought risk mitigation policies (Tsakiris 2017). Public outreach and monitoring of communicable diseases, air and water quality were found to be useful for reducing health impacts of droughts (Yusa&#160;et al. 2015). The evidence from household responses to drought in Cape Town, South Africa, between 2015 and 2017, suggests&#160;that media coverage and social media could play a&#160;decisive role in changing water consumption behaviour, even more so than of&#64257;cial water consumption restrictions (Booysen et al. 2019). Drought risk mitigation approaches are less costly than providing drought relief after the occurrence of droughts. To illustrate, Harou et al. (2010) found that establishment of water markets in California considerably reduced drought costs. Application of water saving technologies reduced drought costs in Iran by&#160;282&#160;million USD (Salami et al. 2009). Booker et al. (2005) calculated that inter-regional trade in water could reduce drought costs by 20&#8211;30% in the Rio Grande basin, USA. Increasing rainfall variability under climate change can make the forms of index insurance based on rainfall less ef&#64257;cient (Kath et al. 2019). A&#160;number of diverse water property instruments, including instruments allowing water transfer, together with the technological and institutional ability to adjust water allocation, can improve timely adjustment to droughts (Hurlbert 2018). Supply-side water management, providing for proportionate reductions in water delivery, prevents the important climate change adaptation option of managing water according to need or demand (Hurlbert and Mussetta 2016). Exclusive use of a&#160;water market to govern water allocation similarly prevents the recognition of the human right to water at times of drought (Hurlbert 2018). Policies aiming to secure land tenure, and to expand access to markets, agricultural advisory services and effective climate services, as well as to create off-farm employment opportunities, can facilitate the adoption of drought risk mitigation practices (Alam 2015; Kusunose and Lybbert 2014), increasing resilience to climate change (Section&#160;3.6.3), while also contributing to SLM (Sections&#160;3.6.3 and&#160;4.8.1, and Table&#160;5.7).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="459.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 459.55; y1: 469.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="459.55" x1="557.6">The excessive burden of drought relief funding on public budgets is already leading to a&#160;paradigm shift towards proactive drought risk mitigation instead of reactive drought relief measures (Verner et al. 2018; Wilhite 2016).

Policies for drought risk mitigation that are already needed now will be even more relevant under higher warming levels (Jerneck and Olsson 2008; McLeman 2013; Wilhite et al. 2014).
