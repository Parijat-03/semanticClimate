<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We examined the 10 &#8216;home institutions&#8217; in the TropEd network for education in international health [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These global health research institutions aim to improve global health. Given the negative effect of greenhouse gas emissions on global health, it is relevant to learn about the extent to which they are shrinking their own carbon footprints and what the facilitators and barriers to progress are so that other institutions can learn from their lessons.</p>
