<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The politics of the Bangladesh post-colonial state, which sees itself as Muslim and Bengali, has served to render indigenous people &#8220;ubiquitously absent as subjects, as actors, as agents in the national imagination; they are invisible in the administrative, educational, economical systems, and in the popular media&#8221; (Priyadarshini <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 22; see also Karim <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The term &#8220;indigenous&#8221; is not officially recognised; with the government declaring that other ethnicities (in Bengali <italic>upojati</italic>, which means small ethnic group) only entered the country in the sixteenth century (Alam <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Substituting the terminology of indigenous peoples with small ethnic groups implies that the state does not need to follow international conventions with regard to acknowledging and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Indeed, the celebration by Santals and others of the International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples was not permitted for some years after 2011 (Alam <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Celebration is now permitted in Dhaka, though not as a national event. The Bangladesh Adivasi Forum, the Bangladesh Indigenous Peoples Forum and other civil society groups seek recognition in the Constitution and are members of Citizens&#8217; Platform for the SDGs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bdplatform4sdgs.net">http://bdplatform4sdgs.net</ext-link>).</p>
