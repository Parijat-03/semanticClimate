Tang and Gekara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>) argue that shipping lines are more responsive to market incentives than regulatory pressure. The IMO MEPC 59 (July 2009) formally requested submissions from members and MEPC 60 (March 2010) appointed an expert group to evaluate the proposals and to report back to MEPC 61 (September 2010). Ten MBM proposals were made, which can be summarised into two main types: an emission trading scheme and a bunker fuel levy or carbon tax. The MEPC analysed all proposals and concluded that, while all proposals were deemed feasible, further study was required. Successive MEPC meetings continued to evaluate the proposals, with no MBM proposal being either accepted or rejected, until the matter was officially suspended three years later at MEPC 65 in May 2013.</p>
