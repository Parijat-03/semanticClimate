Accordingly, a just international finance and capacity-building system is presented as a major aim of the PA (PA, &#167;131; see also PA, &#167; 109). Also the norm of transparency relates to a regulative system of &#8220;accountability&#8221; in political institutions governing the meso-level (SDGs, 16, 17). Mere numerical accounting practices thereby become a normative pivot in the UN documents. As a consequence, accountability as a form of ethical responsibility is reduced to processing and communicating numerical data. Hence, this form of reduction or rationalization corresponds with an accelerated generation of transparent, techno-scientific activity. The latter, according to the UN accounts, is conducive of &#8220;adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability&#8221; (PA, 7.1) in facing the challenges of SD.</p>
