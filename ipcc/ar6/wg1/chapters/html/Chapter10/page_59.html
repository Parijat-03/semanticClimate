However, the dominant large-scale drivers responsible for the precipitation changes observed during these two transitions are markedly different: mainly ice-sheet retreat and increasing insolation on one hand, increasing GHGs on the other hand. This suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum correspondence is fortuitous which strongly limits its use to capture future hydrological cycle changes (Section&#160;8.3.2.4.4; Morrill et&#160;al., 2018; Lowry and Morrill, 2019). Furthermore, the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum drying versus wetting seems to strongly depend on the physical property of interest, hydrologic or vegetation indicators (Scheff et&#160;al., 2017). Droughts are characterized by deficits in total soil moisture content that can be caused by a&#160;combination of decreasing precipitation and warming temperature, which promotes greater evapotranspiration. Regional-scale attribution of the prevalence of south-western North America drought since 1980 then mostly focuses on the attribution of change in these two&#160;variables.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="462.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="462.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 462.6; y1: 472.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The observed south-western North America drying fits the narrative of what might happen in response to increasing GHG concentrations due to a&#160;poleward expansion of the subtropics, that is conducive to drying trends over subtropical to mid-latitude regions (Hu et&#160;al., 2013b; Birner et&#160;al., 2014; Lucas et&#160;al., 2014). However, several studies based on modern reanalyses and CMIP5 models have recently shown that the current contribution of GHGs to Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion is much smaller than in the Southern Hemisphere and will remain difficult to detect due to large internal variability, even by the end of the 21st&#160;century (Section&#160;3.3.3.1; Garfinkel et&#160;al., 2015; Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Grise et&#160;al., 2018, 2019). In addition, the widening of the Northern Hemisphere tropical belt exhibits strong seasonality and zonal asymmetry, particularly in autumn and the North Atlantic (Amaya et&#160;al., 2018; Grise et&#160;al., 2018). Therefore, it seems that the recent Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion results from the interplay of internal and forced modes of tropical width variations and that the forced response has not robustly emerged from internal variability (Sections 3.3.3.1 and&#160;10.4.3).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="222.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="222.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 222.6; y1: 232.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A second possible causal factor is the role for ocean-forced or internal atmospheric circulation change. Analysis of observed and CMIP5-simulated precipitation indicates that the drought prevalence since 1980 is linked to natural, internal variability in the climate system (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). Based on observations and ensembles of SST-driven atmospheric simulations, Seager and Hoerling (2014) suggested that robust tropical Pacific and tropical North Atlantic forcing drove an important fraction of annual mean precipitation and soil moisture changes and that early 21st&#160;century multi-year droughts could be attributed to natural decadal swings in tropical Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs. A&#160;cold state of the tropical Pacific would lead by well-established atmospheric teleconnections to anomalous high pressure across the North Pacific and southern North America, favouring a&#160;weaker jet stream and a&#160;diversion of the Pacific storm track away from </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.07; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">multi-year drought of 2012&#8211;2016 has been linked to the multi-year persistence of anomalously high atmospheric pressure over the north-eastern Pacific Ocean, which deflected the Pacific storm track northward and suppressed regional precipitation during California&#8217;s rainy season (Swain et&#160;al., 2017). Going into more detail, Prein et&#160;al. (2016a) used an assessment of changing occurrence of weather regimes to judge that changes in the frequency of certain regimes during 1979&#8211;2014 have led to a&#160;decline in precipitation by about 25%, chiefly related to the prevalence of anticyclonic circulation patterns in&#160;the north-east Pacific. Finally, the moderate model performance in representing Pacific SST decadal variability and its remote influence (Section&#160;3.7.6) as well as its change under warming may affect attribution results of observed and future precipitation changes (Seager et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="534.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="534.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">It has also been suggested that the ocean-controlled influence is limited and internal atmospheric variability has to be invoked to fully explain the observed history of drought on decadal time scales (Seager and Hoerling, 2014; Seager and Ting, 2017). From roughly 1980 to the present, the regional climate signals show an interesting mix between forced and internal variability. Lehner et&#160;al. (2018) used a&#160;dynamical adjustment method and large ensembles of coupled and SST-forced atmospheric experiments to suggest that the observed south-western North America rainfall decline mainly results from the effects of atmospheric internal variability, which is in part driven by a&#160;PDV-related phase shift in Pacific SST around 2000 (Figure&#160;10.13b,c). Based upon four SMILEs (three using a&#160;GCM and another one an AGCM constrained by observed SSTs) and a&#160;CMIP6 multi-model suite constrained by observed external forcings, Figure&#160;10.13 shows, in agreement with Lehner et&#160;al. (2018), that observed SSTs with their associated atmospheric response are the main drivers of the south-western North America precipitation decrease during the 1983&#8211;2014 period. Once aspects of the internal variability are removed by dynamical adjustment, the observed precipitation change signal and simulated anthropogenically-forced components look more similar (Lehner et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="270.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="270.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Importantly, as the AR6 assessment views the PDV as being mostly driven by internal variability (Section&#160;3.7.6), the lines of evidence cited above suggest that the contribution of natural and anthropogenic forcings to the precipitation decline has a&#160;small amplitude. Unlike the precipitation deficit, the accompanying south-western North America warming is driven primarily by anthropogenic forcing from GHGs rather than atmospheric circulation variability and may help to enhance the drought through increased evapotranspiration (Knutson et&#160;al., 2013; Diffenbaugh et&#160;al., 2015; Williams et&#160;al., 2015, 2020; Lehner et&#160;al., 2018, 2020).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="391.86" top="138.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="138.6" x1="391.86" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">To conclude, there is </span><span style="x0: 392.36; x1: 396.94; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="392.36" y0="138.6" x1="452.16">high confidence </span><span x0="452.68" y0="138.6" x1="455.33" style="x0: 452.68; x1: 455.33; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(</span><span style="x0: 455.32; x1: 458.13; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="455.32" y0="138.6" x1="514.92">robust evidence </span><span x0="515.44" y0="138.6" x1="531.27" style="x0: 515.44; x1: 519.84; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">and </span><span style="x0: 531.78; x1: 538.64; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="531.78" y0="138.6" x1="563.26">medium agreement</span><span x0="353.9" y0="126.6" x1="563.29" style="x0: 353.9; x1: 356.54; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) that most (&gt;50%) of the anomalous atmospheric circulation that caused the south-western North America negative precipitation trend can be attributed to teleconnections arising from tropical Pacific SST variations related to PDV.
