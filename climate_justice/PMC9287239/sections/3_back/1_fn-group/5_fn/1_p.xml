As of November 2021, however, SBTi&#8217;s website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] listed 136 companies that announced commitments between 2015 and 2019 but still do not have an approved SBT. It is unclear if additional companies were, instead, removed from this list for failing to translate commitments into approved SBTs within the 24-month deadline.</p>
