They are also influenced by factors like temperature, vegetation and human land and water management. In a&#160;warmer world, evaporation increases, which can make even wet regions more susceptible to drought.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.84" top="612.26"><span x0="69.02" y0="612.26" x1="539.84" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 612.26; y1: 621.26; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">A drought is broadly defined as drier than normal conditions; that is, a&#160;moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a&#160;given location and season. Since they are locally defined, a&#160;drought in a&#160;wet place will not have the same amount of water deficit as a&#160;drought in a&#160;dry region. Droughts are divided into different categories based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought (precipitation), hydrological drought (runoff, streamflow, and reservoir storage), and agricultural or ecological drought (plant stress from a&#160;combination of evaporation and low soil moisture). Special categories of drought also exist. For example, a&#160;snow drought occurs when winter snowpack levels are below average, which can cause abnormally low streamflow in subsequent seasons. And while many drought events develop slowly over months or years, some events, called flash droughts, can intensify over the course of days or weeks. One such event occurred in 2012 in the Midwestern region of North America and had a&#160;severe impact on agricultural production, with losses exceeding $30 billion US dollars. Droughts typically only become a&#160;concern when they adversely affect people (reducing water available for municipal, industrial, agricultural, or navigational needs) and/or ecosystems (adverse effects on natural flora and fauna). When a&#160;drought lasts for a&#160;very long time (more than two decades) it is sometimes called a&#160;megadrought.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="438.3"><span x0="69.02" y0="438.3" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 77.52; y0: 438.3; y1: 447.3; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Most droughts begin when precipitation is below normal for an extended period of time (meteorological drought). This typically occurs when high pressure in the atmosphere sets up over a&#160;region, reducing cloud formation and precipitation over that area and deflecting away storms. The lack of rainfall then propagates across the water cycle to create agricultural drought in soils and hydrological drought in waterways. Other processes act to amplify or alleviate droughts. For example, if temperatures are abnormally high, evaporation increases, drying out soils and streams and stressing plants beyond what would have occurred from the lack of precipitation alone. Vegetation can play a&#160;critical role because it modulates many important hydrologic processes (soil water, evapotranspiration, runoff). Human activities can also determine how severe a&#160;drought is. For example, irrigating croplands can reduce the socio-economic impact of a&#160;drought; at the same time, depletion of groundwater in aquifers can make a&#160;drought worse.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="312.33"><span x0="69.02" y0="312.33" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 312.33; y1: 321.33; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The effect of climate change on drought varies across regions. In the subtropical regions like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, south-western Australia and south-western South America, as well as tropical Central America, western Africa and the Amazon basin, precipitation is expected to decline as the world warms, increasing the possibility that drought will occur throughout the year (FAQ 8.3, Figure&#160;1). Warming will decrease snowpack, amplifying drought in regions where snowmelt is an important water resource (such as in south-western South America). Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation, resulting in soil drying, increased plant stress, and impacts on agriculture, even in regions where large changes in precipitation are not expected (such as central and northern Europe). If emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed, about a&#160;third of global land areas are projected to suffer from at least moderate drought by 2100. On the other hand, some areas and seasons (such as high-latitude regions in North America and Asia, and the South Asian monsoon region) may experience increases in precipitation as a&#160;result of climate change, which will decrease the likelihood of droughts. FAQ 8.3, Figure&#160;1&#160;highlights the regions where climate change is expected to increase the severity of droughts.</span></div></body></html>
