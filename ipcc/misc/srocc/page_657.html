In models of climate-economic interactions, deferral of emissions reduction now requires trade-offs leading to higher costs of several orders of magnitude and risks of higher temperatures in the longer term (Luderer et&#160;al. 2013). Further, the cost of action is likely to increase over time due to the increased severity of challenges in future scenarios. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="639.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 639.54; y1: 649.04; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="639.54" x1="313.26">Conversely, timely implementation of response options brings economic bene&#64257;ts. Carbon pricing is one economic component to encourage adoption of response options (Jakob et&#160;al. 2016), but carbon pricing alone can induce higher risk in comparison to other scenarios and pathways that include additional targeted sustainability measures, such as promotion of less material- and energy-intensive lifestyles and healthier diets, as noted in our response options (Bertram et&#160;al. 2018). While the short-term costs of deployment of actions may increase, better attainment of a broad set of sustainability targets can be achieved through these combined measures (Bertram et&#160;al. 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="495.55" x1="313.25">There are also investments now that can lead to immediate savings in terms of avoided damages; for example, for each dollar spent on disaster risk management, countries accrue avoided disaster-related economic losses of 4 USD or more (Mechler 2016). While they can require upfront investment, the economic bene&#64257;ts of actions to ensure sustainable land management, such as increased soil organic carbon, can more than double the economic value of rangelands and improve crop yields (Chapter 4 and Section 6.2). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.44" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.18; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 5.98; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="387.56" x1="313.44">Delayed action reduces future policy space and decreases ef&#64257;cacy of some response options: </span><span style="x0: 199.76; x1: 203.98; y0: 375.56; y1: 385.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="199.76" y0="375.56" x1="313.23">The potential for some response options decreases as climate change increases; for example, climate alters the sink capacity for soil and vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing the potential for increased soil organic carbon, afforestation and reforestation (Section 6.4.2). Additionally, climate change affects the productivity of bioenergy crops, in&#64258;uencing the potential mitigation of bioenergy and BECCS (Section 6.4.4).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="279.58"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 279.58; y1: 289.08; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="279.58" x1="313.27">For response options in the supply chain, demand-side management, and risk management, while the consequences of delayed action are apparent in terms of continued GHG emissions from drivers, the tools for response options are not made more dif&#64257;cult by delay and could be deployed at any time. Additionally, given increasing pressures on land as a consequence of delay, some policy response options may become more cost-effective while others become costlier. For example, over time, land-based mitigation measures like forest and ecosystem protection are likely to increase land scarcity, leading to higher food prices; while demand-side measures, like reduced-impact diets and reducing waste, are less likely to raise food prices in economic models (Stevanovi&#263; et&#160;al. 2017). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="123.6"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 123.6; y1: 133.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="123.6" x1="313.25">For risk management, some response options provide timely and rapidly deployable solutions for preventing further problems, such as disaster risk management and risk-sharing instruments.

Ecosystems, such as peatlands, are particularly vulnerable to irreversibility because of the dif&#64257;culties of rewetting to original states (Section 6.2), and dryland grazing systems are vulnerable to tipping points when ground cover falls below 50%, after which productivity falls, in&#64257;ltration declines, and erosion increases (Chapters 3 and 4). Further, tipping points can be especially challenging for human populations to adapt to, given the lack of prior experience with such system shifts (Kates et&#160;al. 2012; Nuttall 2012). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.94" top="567.63"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.65; y0: 567.63; y1: 577.13; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="567.63" x1="571.94">Policy responses require lead time for implementation; delay makes this worse: </span><span style="x0: 399.7; x1: 403.75; y0: 555.63; y1: 565.13; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="399.7" y0="555.63" x1="571.77">For all the response options, particularly those that need to be deployed through policy implementation, there are unavoidable lags in this cycle. &#8216;Policy lags&#8217;, by which implementation is delayed by the slowness of the policy implementation cycle, are signi&#64257;cant across many land-based, response options (Brown et&#160;al. 2019). Further, the behavioural change necessary to achieve some demand-side and risk management response options often takes a&#160;long time, and delay only lengthens this process (Stern 1992; Steg and Vlek 2009). For example, actively promoting the need for healthier and more sustainable diets through individual dietary decisions is an important underpinning and enabling step for future changes, but is likely to be a slow-moving process, and delay in beginning will only exacerbate this. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="434.61" top="387.65"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.71; y0: 387.65; y1: 397.15; width: 5.99; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="387.65" x1="434.61">Delay can lead to lock-in: </span><span style="x0: 436.44; x1: 441.89; y0: 387.65; y1: 397.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="436.44" y0="387.65" x1="571.76">Delay in implementation can cause &#8216;lock-in&#8217; as decisions made today can constrain future development and pathways. For example, decisions made now on where to build infrastructure, make investments and deploy technologies, will have longer-term (decades-long) rami&#64257;cations due to the inertia of capital stocks (Van Soest et&#160;al. 2017). In tandem, the vulnerability of the poor is likely to be exacerbated by climate change, creating a vicious circle of lock in whereby an increasing share of the dwindling carbon budget may be needed to assist with improved energy use for the poorest (Lamb and Rao 2015).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.97" top="255.66"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.71; y0: 255.66; y1: 265.16; width: 5.99; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="255.66" x1="571.97">Delay can increase the need for widespread deployment of land-based mitigation (afforestation, BECCS) </span><span style="x0: 522.71; x1: 525.35; y0: 243.66; y1: 253.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="522.71" y0="243.66" x1="571.77">(IPCC 2018; Stre&#64258;er et&#160;al. 2018): Further delays in mitigation could result in an increased need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options later; for example, delayed mitigation requires a 10% increase in cumulative CDR over the century (IPCC 2018). Similarly, strengthening near-term mitigation effort can reduce the CDR requirements in 2100 by a factor of 2 to 8 (Stre&#64258;er et&#160;al. 2018). Conversely, scenarios with limited CDR require earlier emissions reductions (Van Vuuren et&#160;al. 2017b) and may make more stringent mitigation scenarios, like the 1.5&#176;C, infeasible (Kriegler et&#160;al. 2018a,b).</span></div></body></html>
