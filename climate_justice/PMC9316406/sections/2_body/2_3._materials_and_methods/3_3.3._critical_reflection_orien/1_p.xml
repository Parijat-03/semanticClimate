Critical reflection also features a research method, connecting theory to practice with discursive depth [<xref rid="B60-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. During the two-year period, the instructor&#8217;s expertise and the multi-disaster context encouraged his pedagogical implementation of GSW interventions into social work teaching and training. The internal and external feedback regarding teaching and training efforts (see the data analysis section below) stimulated his critical reflections regarding pedagogical, research, and practice improvements. Furthermore, this two-year learning and training was the first time for the student to learn GSW knowledge and skills. In addition to the learning and field training engagement with the journal faculty member, her personal social work practice experience in the child welfare sector through this multi-disaster context urged her to apply the GSW-specific expertise she learned to re-examine her previous practice interventions, and identify the best strategies to support child welfare. The instructor&#8217;s and the student&#8217;s critical reflections formulate the primary data of this article.</p>
