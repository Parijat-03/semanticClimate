Arame's youth adhered to the party in huge numbers, followed by some Djobel young men, but, in the neighboring village of Elia, forced mobilization and the kidnapping and assassination of those who refused made the elders ask for help from the Portuguese army. The colonial army's bombing of Arame forced the inhabitants to flee and take refuge in Casamance in the mid-1960s. Djobel and Cassu inhabitants followed them a year after (see also Dias, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1974</xref>: 84, 114). Refugees from these three villages returned after Independence (1974), but around half of the population of Djobel decided to stay in Senegal.</p>
