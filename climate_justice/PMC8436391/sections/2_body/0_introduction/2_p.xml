<p>In the contemporary &#8216;disrupted&#8217; conditions, deep concerns such as crises of
governance, a changing climate and the use of technologies come to the fore, and these are
developing areas for practice, education and research in both social work and community
development. As university educators who teach community development on social work programmes
in Irish and Australian universities, we draw on these critical themes and our own pedagogical
practices developed over many years to advance conversations about community development
teaching and learning in the contemporary context. In this paper, we focus on principles and
pedagogies that can enable us to attune social work education to this changing practice context.
We examine a set of principles that underpins our community development pedagogy and demonstrate
how we seek to generate a process of collaborative critical inquiry, engage students in
reflective praxis enriched by contemporary theory and research, and facilitate &#8216;going
deeper&#8217; on global and local issues in a connected and adaptive way. Grounding social work
teaching and learning in values such as social justice and human rights, critical thinking and
working collectively advances dynamic, innovative forms of practice that can respond to
community and societal issues.</p>
