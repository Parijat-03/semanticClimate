Understanding the integrated response options available in a given context requires an understanding of the speci&#64257;cities of social vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and institutional support to assist communities, households and regions to reach their capabilities and achievement of the SDG and other social and land management goals. Vulnerability re&#64258;ects how assets are distributed within and among communities, shaped by factors that are not easily overcome with technical solutions, including inequality and marginalisation, poverty, and access to resources (Adger et&#160;al. 2004; Hallegate et&#160;al. 2016). Understanding why some people are vulnerable, and what structural factors perpetuate this vulnerability requires attention to both micro and meso scales (Tschakert et&#160;al. 2013). These vulnerabilities create barriers to adoption of even low-cost high-return response options, such as soil carbon management, that may seem obviously bene&#64257;cial to implement (Mutoko et&#160;al. 2014; Cavanagh et&#160;al. 2017). Thus, assessment of the differentiated vulnerabilities that may prevent the adoption of a response option need to be considered as part of any package of interventions. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="87.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 87.56; y1: 97.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="87.56" x1="313.21">Adaptive capacity relates to the ability of institutions or people to modify or change characteristics or behaviour so as to cope better with existing or anticipated external stresses (Moss et&#160;al. 2001; </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="339.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.65; y0: 339.57; y1: 349.07; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="339.57" x1="571.77">Brenkert and Malone 2005; Brooks et&#160;al. 2005). Adaptive capacity re&#64258;ects institutional and policy support networks, and has often been associated at the national level with strong developments in the &#64257;elds of economics, education, health, and governance and political rights (Smit et&#160;al. 2001). Areas with low adaptive capacity, as re&#64258;ected in low Human Development Index scores, might constrain the ability of communities to implement response options (Section&#160;6.4.4.1 and&#160;Figure 6.7).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="231.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.77; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="231.58" x1="571.78">Further, while environmental changes like land degradation have obvious social and cultural impacts, (as discussed in the preceding chapters), so do response options. Therefore, careful thought is needed about what impacts are expected and what trade-offs are acceptable. One potential way to assess the impact of response interventions relates to the idea of capabilities, a concept &#64257;rst proposed by economist Amartya Sen (Sen 1992). Understanding capability as the &#8216;freedom to achieve well-being&#8217; frames a problem as being a matter of facilitating what people aspire to do and be, rather than telling them to achieve a standardised or predetermined outcome (Nussbaum and Sen 1993). Thus a capability approach is generally a more &#64258;exible and multi-purpose framework, appropriate to an SES understanding because of its open-ended approach (Bockstael and Berkes 2017). Thus, one question for any decision-maker approaching schematics of response options is to determine </span></div><div left="329.44" right="376.91" top="542.11"><span style="x0: 329.44; x1: 336.41; y0: 542.11; y1: 551.07; width: 6.97; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0.49, 0.39, 0.38, 0.2]; font-family: ACEONO+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="329.44" y0="542.11" x1="376.91">Management action</span></div><div left="337.48" right="368.85" top="496.17"><span style="x0: 337.48; x1: 341.3; y0: 496.17; y1: 505.14; width: 3.82; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0.49, 0.39, 0.38, 0.2]; font-family: ACEONO+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="337.48" y0="496.17" x1="368.85">Food and fuel</span></div><div left="78.78" right="117.95" top="735.33"><span style="x0: 78.78; x1: 83.26; y0: 735.33; y1: 744.3; width: 4.48; font-size: 8.96; fill: [1]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: ACEKPF+FrutigerLTStd-BoldCn;" x0="78.78" y0="735.33" x1="117.95">Ecosystem</span><span style="x0: 203.5; x1: 210.48; y0: 735.22; y1: 744.18; width: 6.97; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0.49, 0.39, 0.38, 0.2]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: ACEONO+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="203.5" y0="735.22" x1="286.16">Monitoring and learning</span></div><div left="329.44" right="376.91" top="687.27"><span style="x0: 329.44; x1: 336.42; y0: 687.27; y1: 696.23; width: 6.97; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0.49, 0.39, 0.38, 0.2]; stroke: [0.69, 0.35, 0, 0]; font-family: ACEONO+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="329.44" y0="687.27" x1="376.91">Management plans</span></div></body></html>
