Guests consistently described how they have experienced environmental injustices in their personal and professional lives as it relates to their social identities such as race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, and so on. For example, a podcast guest Isaias Hernandez (Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>, episode 11), an environmental educator who runs the Instagram account &#8220;QueerBrownVegan,&#8221; talked about how he grew up in a poor community in southern California that was exposed to air pollution due to proximity to a toxic industrial plant. However, he did not realize his unjust&#160;community context until he was much older when he went to school and learned about environmental justice.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>BGC episodes focused on the theme of environmental justice</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Guest</th><th align="left">Podcast episode</th><th align="left">Title of podcast episode</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Frances Roberts-Gregory</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>) Ep. 20</td><td align="left">On Being a Black Feminist Environmental Ethnographer</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Isaias Hernandez</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>) Ep. 11</td><td align="left">Making Space for Queer People of Color in the Environmental Movement</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Dr. Ingrid Waldron</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>) Ep. 10</td><td align="left">There&#8217;s Something In the Water</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Stacey Isaac Berahzer</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>) Ep. 3</td><td align="left">Water Affordability and Equity in America</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
