From 1980 to 2014, spring maize growing periods have shifted an average of&#160;4.6 days per decade earlier, while sowing of autumn maize has been delayed&#160;3.0 days per decade(Abbas et al. 2017). A&#160;similar study with sun&#64258; ower showed that increases in mean temperature from 1980 to 2016 were highly correlated with shifts in sowing, emergence, anthesis, and maturity for fall and spring crops (Tariq et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="591.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.59; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="591.54" x1="313.27">Mountain people in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region encompassing parts of Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China, are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity related to climate change because of poor infrastructure, limited access to global markets, physical isolation, low productivity, and hazard exposure, including Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) (Rasul et al. 2019; Rasul 2010; Tiwari and Joshi 2012; Huddleston et al. 2003; Ward et al. 2013; FAO 2008; Nautiyal et al. 2007; Din et al. 2014). Surveys have been conducted to determine how climate-related changes have affected food security (Hussain et al. 2016; Shrestha and Nepal 2016) with results showing that the region is experiencing an increase in extremes, with farmers facing more frequent &#64258; oods as well as prolonged droughts with ensuing negative impacts on agricultural yields and increases in food insecurity (Hussain et al. 2016; Manzoor et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="119.66" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="65.2" y0="411.56" x1="119.66">South America </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="387.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 387.57; y1: 397.07; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="387.57" x1="313.25">In another mountainous region, the Andes, inhabitants are also beginning to experience changes in the timing, severity, and patterns of the annual weather cycle. Data collected through participatory workshops, semi-structured interviews with agronomists, and qualitative &#64257; eldwork from 2012 to 2014 suggest that in Colomi, Bolivia, climate change is affecting crop yields and causing farmers to alter the timing of planting, their soil management strategies, and the use and spatial distribution of crop varieties (Saxena et al. 2016).

In Nigeria, there have been reports of climate change having impacts on the livelihoods of arable crop farmers (Abiona et al. 2016; Ifeanyi-obi et al. 2016; Onyeneke 2018). The Sahel region of Cameroon has experienced an increasing level of malnutrition. This is partly due to the impact of climate change since harsh climatic conditions leading to extreme drought have a&#160;negative in&#64258; uence on agriculture (Chabejong 2016). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="543.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.34; y0: 543.6; y1: 553.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="543.6" x1="571.74">Utilising farmer interviews in Abia State, Nigeria, researchers found that virtually all responders agreed that the climate was changing in their area (Ifeanyi-obi et al. 2016). With regard to management responses, a&#160;survey of farmers from Anambra State, Nigeria, showed that farmers are adapting to climate change by utilising such techniques as mixed cropping systems, crop rotation, and fertiliser application (Onyeneke et al. 2018). In Ebonyi State, Nigeria, Eze (2017) interviewed 160 women cassava farmers and found the major climate change risks in production to be severity of high temperature stress, variability in relative humidity, and &#64258; ood frequency. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="348.88" top="411.62"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 411.62; y1: 421.12; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.72" y0="411.62" x1="348.88">Europe</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="387.62"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 387.62; y1: 397.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="387.62" x1="571.8">The impacts of climate change are varied across the continent. Moore and Lobell (2015) showed via counterfactual analysis that climate trends are affecting European crop yields, with long-term temperature and precipitation trends since 1989 reducing continent-wide wheat and barley yields by&#160;2.5% and&#160;3.8%, respectively, and having slightly increased maize and sugar beet yields. Though these aggregate affects appear small, the impacts are not evenly distributed. In cooler regions such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, the effect of increased warming has been ameliorated by an increase in rainfall.
