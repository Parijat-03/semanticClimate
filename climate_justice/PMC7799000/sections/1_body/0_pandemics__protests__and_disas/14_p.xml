<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Over the summer, I contacted a group I collaborate with, the Humanities Action Lab (<sc>Hal</sc>), to say that I am now a person who has spent almost three years of her life in critical disaster studies, looking at real-time collecting and real-time narration of disaster. What can I do to help how <sc>Hal</sc> is taking the climate justice projects that they're working on and linking them to COVID-19 through the collection of first-person narratives? I've been working with the students who were previously trained through my Hurricane Maria project to start looking at COVID-19 stories. We're coming up with several issues here. Anger and sadness and depression&#8212;a really tangible understanding that people of color don't matter in the eyes of this presidential administration.</p>
