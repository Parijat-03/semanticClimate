<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0125">Recent ongoing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the global oil crash both underscore the urgency of adopting and implementing just transition policies. Reduced demand for electricity has had an acute impact on coal, with analysts predicting the industry, unable to compete with cheaper renewables, will likely not recover post-pandemic <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. As a result, the COVID-19 crisis represents a unique opportunity to adopt just transition principles into community and economic recovery efforts. To be sure, challenges exist. For example, the pandemic has resulted in the loss of over half a million clean energy jobs, halting momentum in sectors like solar and wind <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. While the International Energy Agency has predicted a recovery in renewables following the early stages of the pandemic, uncertainty remains <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, there is tremendous upside in incorporating just transition policies into recovery efforts at the state and federal levels. In the U.S., massive stimulus bills such as the CARES Act represent an opportunity for parallel investments in clean energy and green jobs programs to support a just recovery and bolster economic and social resilience. Possible measures include targeted support for renewable energy projects, weatherization programs, building retrofits, electric vehicle manufacturing, and green job creation <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The potential for combining energy transition and recovery initiatives is likewise accompanied by the usual caveats with regard to funding needs, program implementation, and community participation. However, because just transition frameworks emerged out of diverse organizational coalitions and have evolved over the last few decades to respond to shifting social, environmental, and energy realities, they remain essential for supporting a shift to a low-carbon energy system that prioritizes sustainability and social and economic equity.</p>
