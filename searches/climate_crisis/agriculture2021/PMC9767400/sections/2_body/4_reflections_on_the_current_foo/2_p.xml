Women's dual involvement in local food security in the Global South, both as primary food producers and as primary caretakers of the household, is undeniable. Unfortunately, the increased recognition of women's contribution to food security in recent years has not led to the systemic change needed in the current food security paradigm, specifically in the food systems discourse. While a focus on productivity, the environmental implications and consumption behaviors seems to continue to dominate the food system paradigm, a structural embedding of a gender lens remains underexplored. There has been an increase in attention to women's involvement in food security debates, but based on <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al. (2019)</xref> this has not led to &#8216;actual investments dedicated to women's empowerment and resulting outcomes on gender equality and enhanced food security&#8217;.</p>
