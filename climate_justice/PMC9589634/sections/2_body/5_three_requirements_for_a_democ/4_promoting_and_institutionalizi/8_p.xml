This is particularly clear with regard to the last point, as mini-publics are very elaborate and time-consuming participation processes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> There are certainly limiting cases in which a major threat puts not only a large number of lives, but also the stability and survival of a democratic system of rule itself at risk. In these cases, the temporary use of emergency powers, including the suspension of democratic procedures in favor of hierarchical and expertocratic forms of decision-making can be justified. As we have argued, however, the climate crisis, as the presently most alarming threat, is not simply an emergency situation, but must be understood as a long-term problem. Given the long time horizon for combatting the crisis and the severe conflicts that will arise over the distributions of costs for necessary adjustments and restrictions, democratic standards cannot be abandoned in climate decision-making without risking legitimacy and compliance.</p>
