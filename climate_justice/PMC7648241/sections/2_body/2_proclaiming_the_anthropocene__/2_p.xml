The major concern of researchers in this field is largely concentrated upon regulating the stability of the Earth System within &#8220;planetary boundaries&#8221;&#8212;a safe operating space for humanity (Rockstr&#246;m et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>; see also Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). The concept of planetary boundaries has become a dominant framework for integrating the physical science of understanding the processes of the Earth System into the social science of studying the policy and governance response at the global level. It also provides a powerful narrative that captures the growing worries among scientists (and the public at large) over the alarming rate of environmental change which might be reaching beyond the Earth&#8217;s capacity to absorb human impacts and sustain life within it.</p>
