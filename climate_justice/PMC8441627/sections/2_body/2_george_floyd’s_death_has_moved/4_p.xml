<p>The perfect storm was completed by President Trump&#8217;s response. Trump has been the Divider&#8208;in&#8208;Chief since announcing his candidacy for president, having been a &#8216;leader&#8217; in insisting Obama was not an American citizen and basing his campaign on race&#8208;baiting Latinos as drug dealers and murderers. He is a genius in his ability to cultivate the allegiance of an xenophobic, racist, right&#8208;wing base and Christian conservatives. His malignant narcissism makes it impossible for him to accept even the slightest criticism, which he responds to with brutal attacks on the character of his opponents. Trump accomplished the amazing feat of bending the entire federal government to his whims and insecurities, locking in the Senate with re&#8208;election threats to any Republican that didn&#8217;t toe the Trump line (Packer, April&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
