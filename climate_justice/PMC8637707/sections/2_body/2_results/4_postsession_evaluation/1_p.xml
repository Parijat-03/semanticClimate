(78%) to 66 (85%) respondents out of an average of 78 unique attendees per
session (see <xref rid="table3-23821205211061019" ref-type="table">Table
3</xref>). The large majority of survey respondents reported that the
objectives of the training were met and that the sessions delivered balanced,
objective, and evidence-based content, and rated opportunities to ask questions
as very good or excellent. Additionally, participants reported that they
intended to apply the knowledge they acquired and that they were better able to
communicate with other interprofessional team members. The most common practice
change reported was that participants used skills they learned to improve their
climate-related health discussions with patients.</p>
