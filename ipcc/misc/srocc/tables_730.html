      <td>Differential vulnerability to climate change is related to inequality in rights-based resource access, established through formal\nand informal tenure systems. In only 37% of 161 developing and developed countries do men and women have equal rights to use\nand control land, and in 59% customary, traditional, and religious practices discriminate against women (OECD 2014), even if the law\nformally grants equal rights. Women play a significant role in agriculture, food security and rural economies globally, forming 43% of\nthe agricultural labour force in developing countries (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, &amp; WHO, 2018, p. 102), ranging from 25% in Latin America\n(FAO, 2017, p. 89) to nearly 50% in Eastern Asia and Central and South Europe (FAO, 2017, p. 88) and 47% in Sub-Saharan Africa (FAO,\n2017, pp. 88). Further, the share of women in agricultural employment has been growing in all developing regions except East Asia\nand Southeast Asia (FAO, 2017, p. 88). At the same time, women constitute less than 5% of landholders (with legal rights and/or use-\nrights (Doss et al. 2018a) in North Africa and West Asia, about 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 12% in Southern and Southeastern Asia,\n18% in Latin America and Caribbean (FAO 2011b, p. 25), 10% in Bangladesh, 4% in Nigeria (FAO 2015c). Patriarchal structures and\ngender roles can also affect women&#8217;s control over land in developed countries (Carter 2017; Alston et al. 2018b). Thus, longstanding\ngender inequality in land rights, security of tenure, and decision-making may constrict women&#8217;s adaptation options (Smucker and\nWangui 2016).</td>

      <td>Adaptation options related to land and climate (see Chapter 6) may produce environment and development trade-offs as well as\nsocial conflicts (Hunsberger et al. 2017) and changes with gendered implications. Women&#8217;s strong presence in agriculture provides an\nopportunity to bring gender dimensions into climate change adaptation, particularly regarding food security (Glemarec 2017; Jost et\nal. 2016; Doss et al. 2018b). Some studies point to a potentially emancipatory role played by adaptation interventions and strategies,\nalbeit with some limitations depending on context. For example, in developing contexts, male out-migration may cause women in\nsocially disadvantaged groups to engage in new livelihood activities, thus challenging gendered roles (Djoudi and Brockhaus 2011;\nAlston 2006). Collective action and agency of women in farming households, including widows, have led to prevention of crop\nfailure, reduced workload, increased nutritional intake, increased sustainable water management, diversified and increased income\nand improved strategic planning (Andersson and Gabrielsson 2012). Women&#8217;s waged labour can help stabilise income from more\nland- and climate-dependent activities such as agriculture, hunting, or fishing (Alston et al., 2018; Ford and Goldhar, 2012). However,\nin developed contexts like Australia, women&#8217;s participation in off-farm employment may exacerbate existing masculinisation of\nagriculture (Clarke and Alston 2017).</td>

      <td>Literature suggests that land-based mitigation measures may lead to land alienation, either through market or appropriation\n(acquisition) by the government, may interfere with traditional livelihoods in rural areas, and lead to decline in women&#8217;s livelihoods\n(Hunsberger et al. 2017). If land alienation is not prevented, existing inequities and social exclusions may be reinforced (medium\nagreement) (Mustalahti and Rakotonarivo 2014; Chomba et al. 2016; Poudyal et al. 2016). These activities also can lead to land grabs,\nwhich remain a focal point for research and local activism (Borras Jr. et al. 2011; White et al. 2012; Lahiff 2015). Cumulative effects\nof land-based mitigation measures may put families at risk of poverty. In certain contexts, they lead to increased conflicts. In conflict\nsituations, women are at risk of personal violence, including sexual violence (UNEP, 2016).</td>

While macro-level data can reveal ongoing gender trends in SLM, contextual data are important for revealing intersectional\naspects, such as the difference made by family relations, socio-economic status, or cultural practices about land use and control (Rao\n2017a; Arora-Jonsson 2014; Theriault et al. 2017b), as well as on security of land holding (Doss et al. 2018b). Indices such as the\nWomen&#8217;s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Alkire et al. 2013b) may provide useful guidelines for quantitative data collection on\ngender and SLM, while qualitative studies can reveal the nature of agency and whether policies are likely to be accepted, or not, in\nthe context of local structures, meanings, and social relations (Rao 2017b).</td>
