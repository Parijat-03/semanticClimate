<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Lorentzen and colleagues offered their views on COVID&#8208;19 as a consequence of a biodiversity crisis related to climate change (Lorentzen et al., <xref rid="phn12866-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). With habitat destruction and climate change, they suggested that the biodiversity crisis will accelerate as the main driver of our current and future emerging pandemics. They also noted that the emergence of COVID&#8208;19 may be only the beginning of the emergence of novel coronaviruses and other infectious diseases that will affect humans, livestock, birds, marine life, and other organisms in the 21st century.</p>
