They argued that there are urgent acute and chronic health issues that are paramount during this unprecedented pandemic. Edmonds et al. described the key roles of public health nurses in investigating case contact searches, education about social distancing and face covers as key opportunities for minimizing COVID spread, and educating the public about guidelines from the CDC. Further they noted that public health nurses are experts in responding to infectious and chronic disease challenges, and offering safe, nondiscriminatory care that can successfully address systemic and structural racism and challenges that disproportionately affect black/brown people in our COVID&#8208;19 situation. These same populations are also disproportionately affecting these populations in our climate&#8208;changing world. In this review, we supported these views and further advocated that public health nursing has an important role in linking COVID&#8208;19 and the complex health challenges posed by the pandemic with the dire health consequences that are inextricably linked with climate change.</p>
