As per Gu et&#160;al. (2015), 56% of cities with populations greater than 300,000 in 2014 are exposed to at least one of the six physical hazards (cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions). Cities in areas highly exposed and vulnerable to multiple hazards were also the ones that grew rapidly in population between 1950 and 2014, implying greater infrastructural investments in climate-sensitive areas. Among 27 cities highly exposed to multiple disasters, 13 cities had a population of 1&#160;million or more in 2014. Among them were three megacities, Tokyo (Japan), Osaka (Japan) and Manila (the Philippines), with more than 10&#160;million inhabitants exposed to three or more hazards. Seven other cities with 1&#160;million inhabitants or more in Asia were at high risk of three or more types of disaster. Manila is highly vulnerable to economic losses and disaster-related mortality from all six types of disasters. Moscow (Russia) is the only megacity not exposed to the risk of any of the six types of physical hazards analysed (cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcano eruptions). Of the eight megacities most vulnerable to disaster-related mortality, seven&#8211;Tokyo, Osaka, Karachi, Kolkata, Manila, Tianjin and Jakarta, totalling 143&#160;million people&#8211;are in Asia (Gu et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="218.3" top="474.63"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.08; y0: 474.63; y1: 484.13; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="42.52" y0="474.63" x1="218.3">10.4.6.3.2 Extreme temperatures and heatwaves</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.11" top="450.64"><span x0="42.52" y0="450.64" x1="296.11" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 48.14; y0: 450.64; y1: 460.14; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Urbanisation and climate change interact to drive an urban heat island (UHI) effect across Asian cities (Hauck et&#160;al., 2016; Chapman et&#160;al., 2017; also see Figure&#160;6.4 in Chapter 6).

In West Asia and the North China Plain especially, extreme wet-bulb temperatures are expected to approach, and possibly exceed, the physiological threshold for human adaptability (35&#176;C) (Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Kang and Eltahir, 2018). By the end of the century, under higher projections (RCP8.5), the daily maximum wet-bulb temperature is expected to exceed the survivability threshold across most of South Asia (Im et&#160;al., 2017). City-specific studies articulate what these regional projections will mean for urban populations. For example, at 1.5&#176;C warming, without adaptation, annual heat-related mortality in 27 major cities across China is projected to increase from 32.1 per million inhabitants annually in 1986&#8211;2005 to 48.8&#8211;67.1 per million. This number increases to 59.2&#8211;81.3 per million for 2&#176;C warming (Wang et&#160;al., 2019a). In the Republic of Korea, deaths from heat disorders are expected to increase approximately fivefold under the RCP4.5 and 7.2-fold under RCP8.5 by 2060 compared with the current baseline value of ~23 people per summer (Kim et&#160;al., 2016a). Importantly, heat exposure is differentiated within cities: it disproportionally affects the poorest populations (Lohrey et&#160;al., 2021) and those with lesser access to green spaces (Arifwidodo and Chandrasiri, 2020).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="554.6" top="354.65"><span style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.12; y0: 354.65; y1: 364.15; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="306.56" y0="354.65" x1="554.6">10.4.6.3.3 Precipitation extremes: excess rainfall, drought and water scarcity</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.14" top="318.66"><span x0="306.56" y0="318.66" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 314.12; y0: 318.66; y1: 328.16; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Warming from 1.5&#176;C to 2&#176;C will increase extreme precipitation events across Asia especially over East and South Asia (</span><span style="x0: 491.69; x1: 498.54; y0: 306.66; y1: 316.16; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="491.69" y0="306.66" x1="560.16">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span x0="363.92" y0="294.66" x1="560.14" style="x0: 363.92; x1: 366.56; y0: 294.66; y1: 304.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Zhang et&#160;al. 2018; Supari et&#160;al., 2020; Zhang et&#160;al., 2020b).
