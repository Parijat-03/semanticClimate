I'm not a magic person, but I've lived in this area for the last 35&#8201;years, I have grown up here as a young person, I was an Aboriginal Heritage Officer in the National Park, an Education Coordinator, I've studied Environmental Science as well as bringing in a cultural perspective into that area, and I had a number of different tools and attributes that I could bring in, that's in my household. In their mum's household, they had both adult caregivers in that household, one who is actively fighting fires with National Parks, both worked in National Parks so integrated into that landscape and could provide a different level of knowledge and experience around that event. So, the kids had a much better and more resilient perspective and ability around that incident, against their peers.</p>
