      <td>Timely access to medical care is crucial for\neveryday life as well as during a disaster event.\nThe vulnerability of population concentrations\nwith limited access to health services is\nexacerbated during heat waves, flooding and\nlandslides, which may lead to higher mortalities\nor long-term health risks. During a flood event,\nthe population with access to a healthcare\nfacility potentially declines to 63.9%, as\ncompared to 98.9% on normal days.</td>

The current trends of deteriorating air\nquality coupled with indoor air pollution\nincrease health risks and make populations more\nvulnerable. Those living in smaller houses, with\nkitchens not separated from the living quarters\nare the most vulnerable.</td>
