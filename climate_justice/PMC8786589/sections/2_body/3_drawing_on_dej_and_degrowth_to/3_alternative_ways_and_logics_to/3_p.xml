Human&#8211;nature dualism was consolidated in the process of European enlightenment and was instrumental in justifying European colonialism, dispossession and enslaving of colonized non-Europeans and capitalist endeavours that began some 500&#160;years ago (Sch&#246;neberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2019</xref>; Hickel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020a</xref>). This duality persists and helps maintain domination of humans over more-than-humans (animal and plant species), reducing them to mere resources and/or service providers to one supreme species.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> For instance, concepts such as &#8216;ecosystem services&#8217; effectively reproduce such logics (Sullivan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2010</xref>).</p>
