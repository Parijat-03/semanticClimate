Mean summer temperatures of above 22&#160;&#176;C are (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, top left) positively associated with WNV infections; the relationship is linear and strong in the first specification, however, becomes less significant in the &#8220;Full model&#8221; specification after controlling for all other variables.</p>
