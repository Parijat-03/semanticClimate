<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our statistical analysis comprises multivariable GEEs to model the relationship between each of the dependent variables and the set of independent variables described previously. Ward level descriptive statistics for all our dependent and independent variables are listed below (<xref rid="ijerph-18-04800-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While values of the UHRI vary considerably across the study area in both May and September, a wider range and higher variability can be observed in May. For values of the NDVI, the variability is greater in September than May&#8212;a potential reflection of post-monsoon vegetation increases in the northern and southwestern wards. With regard to the independent variables, the proportions of socially vulnerable groups such as children, SCs, and agricultural workers indicate relatively lower variability in their values. However, the proportions of households with assets and electricity, as well as those owning their house, indicate considerably higher variability and suggest substantial socioeconomic disparities across the NCT of Delhi.</p>
