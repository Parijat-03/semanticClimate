We also propose that the major fossil fuel extraction corporations be held responsible for their role in contributing to climate change and therefore be asked to contribute to reparations. Not only have they profited financially over time, but these corporations have led a campaign over many years to deny the existence of human-induced climate change, funding scientists and lobbyists to do their bidding&#8212;and then when it was no longer possible to deny the existence of climate change, they argued that fossil fuel extraction and use were not the cause.<sup><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
