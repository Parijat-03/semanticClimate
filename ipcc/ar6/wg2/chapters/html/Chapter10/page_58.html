Institutional incentives to agricultural production, for instance, are frequently compounded by the negative impacts they have on existing bases of natural resources. The disconnected operations of local governmental agencies coupled with inadequacies of cross-sectoral coordination further highlights the prevalent food&#8211;water&#8211;energy nexus (Rasul, 2016). One possible way of addressing these intersecting sources&#8217; complexity is by locating emerging CCA measures in educational development. The introduction of CCA thinking into land-use planning in the Philippines is an example of the successful role of enhancing public education and awareness through the dissemination of information by institutional channels. The linkages between the strength of local leadership and the inclusion of CCA in localised planning activities are also well illustrated by the case study of Cuevas (2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.05" top="534.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="534.63" x1="296.05" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 534.63; y1: 544.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As shown in the case of Pakistan, level of education shares a positive relationship with the implementation of adaptation measures (Ali and Erenstein, 2017). However, a closer examination of the educational imperatives that drive CCA in ways that improve the representational architecture of adaptation actions through a focus on gender is needed. Mainstreaming of gender into CCA would involve addressing a host of barriers to education and involvement that are often rooted in the differential structures of households, social norms and roles, and the domestic division of labour (Rao et&#160;al., 2019). A study from the Indian state of Bihar shows that gender plays a major role in determining intra-household decision making and also inhibits the ability of female-headed households to establish access to agricultural extension services (Mehar et&#160;al., 2016). Even within wider female farmer-operated federations, such as the Bangladesh Kishani Sabha (BKS), the barriers to participation stem from social factors that include the limitation of female mobility through the gendered division of labour and a lack of recognition of female agency (Routledge, 2015). Gendered inequalities in educational attainment and outcomes viewed through the lens of social vulnerability thus intersect with environmental vulnerabilities in ways that affect the ability of women to participate in CCA, owing also to a lack of access to health and sanitation facilities. These factors have a direct impact on the ability of adaptation to be effective in the global South, and are especially important in the context of the commitments of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women countries to the objective of gender equality (Roy, 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="194.93" top="198.48"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.72; y0: 198.48; y1: 208.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="42.52" y0="198.48" x1="194.93">10.5.2 Technology and Innovation</span></div><div left="42.52" right="151.63" top="174.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="174.48" x1="151.63" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 174.48; y1: 184.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.2.1 Point of Departure</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.1" top="150.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="150.6" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 49.91; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Much like any other field, CCA is greatly facilitated by science, technology and continuous innovation. These range from the application of existing science, to the development of new scientific tools and methods, to the utilisation of Indigenous knowledge and citizen science. Many of the pressing problems in Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, loss of natural habitats, biodiversity, rising coastal and river basin hazards, and agricultural loss can be effectively minimised through the adoption of suitable scientific and technological methods. Despite the current challenges in the region, </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.14" top="714.62"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.62" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 310.96; y0: 714.62; y1: 724.12; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">and the future prospects look bright. The following sections outline the present status and future prospects of science and technology in scaling up adaptation actions in four key sectors, namely (a) DRR, (b) urbanisation, (c) water and agriculture, and (d) forests and biodiversity.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="377.55" top="654.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="654.48" x1="377.55" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 654.48; y1: 664.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.2.2 Findings</span></div><div left="306.57" right="426.25" top="630.6"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.13; y0: 630.6; y1: 640.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="306.57" y0="630.6" x1="426.25">10.5.2.2.1 Disaster risk reduction</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.12" top="606.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="606.6" x1="560.12" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 606.6; y1: 616.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Technological advances have enhanced the capabilities of Asian countries to monitor and prepare for climate-related hazards. Remote sensing technologies and GIS are widely used for DRR (Kato et&#160;al., 2017), for example, to assess and mitigate risks of an area to potential climate-related disasters (Wu et&#160;al., 2018b). The potential impacts of different types of hazards can be visualised using interactive maps (Lee, 2017), which help local communities to understand risks and find appropriate evacuation areas (Cadiz, 2018). These maps provide a situational overview and instant risk assessment (Yang et&#160;al., 2012b). As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) can identify conditioning factors of a landslide disaster (Hong et&#160;al., 2019b). Mobile virtual reality is used for disaster mitigation training through a three- dimensional visualisation of a past disaster (Ghosh et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.17" top="438.63"><span x0="306.57" y0="438.63" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.02; y0: 438.63; y1: 448.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A community-based DRR system provides risk investigation, training and information analysis (Liu et&#160;al., 2016b). Sharing information enhances establishment of such a system and contributes to disaster prevention (Nakamura et&#160;al., 2017). One example is an online mapping tool, which has been developed by volunteers (Sakurai and Thapa, 2017). Social media enables the population to access real-time information on a disaster (Ghosh et&#160;al., 2018), raises situation awareness (Yin et&#160;al., 2012) and empowers communities towards appropriate emergency actions (Leong et&#160;al., 2015). Among the various forms of social media, Twitter is widely used as a social sensor to detect what is happening in a disaster event (Sakaki et&#160;al., 2013). Accuracy of information on Twitter has been proved in collecting local details about floods (Shi et&#160;al., 2019b); however, it has been noticed that Twitter generates rumours as well (Ogasahara et&#160;al., 2019). Artificial intelligence is expected to reduce human error when they operate a decision-making system (Lin et&#160;al., 2018). Since technologies supporting DRR completely depend on electricity, the loss of power supply and communication constrains the recovery work in disaster- affected areas (Sakurai et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="392.14" top="198.66"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.13; y0: 198.66; y1: 208.16; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="306.57" y0="198.66" x1="392.14">10.5.2.2.2 Urban sector</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.18" top="174.66"><span x0="306.57" y0="174.66" x1="560.18" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 174.66; y1: 184.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the urban sector, a wide variety of sensor technologies are being used to monitor urban land-use and climate changes over time, and to better understand the potential impacts of future changes. These sensors range from large optical&#8211;thermal&#8211;radar satellite instruments with (near) global coverage&#8211;for example, Landsat (US Geological Service), Sentinel (European Space Agency), ALOS (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and MethaneSAT&#8211;to portable sensors embedded in mobile phones (e.g., phone cameras or temperature sensors) whose data are collected into centralised databases through crowdsourcing (Fenner et&#160;al., 2017; Meier et&#160;al., 2017).
