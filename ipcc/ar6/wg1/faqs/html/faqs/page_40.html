Since at least 1970 there has been a&#160;persistent imbalance in the energy flows that has led to excess energy being absorbed by the climate system. By measuring and understanding these energy flows and the role that human activities play in changing them, we are better able to understand the causes of climate change and project future climate change more&#160;accurately.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.86" top="602.06"><span x0="69.02" y0="602.06" x1="539.86" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 76.03; y0: 602.06; y1: 611.06; width: 7.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Our planet receives vast amounts of energy every day in the form of sunlight.

The rest is absorbed by the ocean, land, ice and atmosphere. The planet then emits energy back out to space in the form of thermal radiation. In a&#160;world that was not warming or cooling, these energy flows would balance. Human activity has caused an imbalance in these energy flows.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="536.07"><span x0="69.02" y0="536.07" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 536.07; y1: 545.07; width: 9.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">We measure the influence of various human and natural factors on the energy flows at the top of our atmosphere in terms of </span><span style="x0: 118.06; x1: 121.57; y0: 524.08; y1: 533.08; width: 3.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="118.06" y0="524.08" x1="191.42">radiative forcings</span><span x0="191.42" y0="524.08" x1="539.82" style="x0: 191.42; x1: 193.93; y0: 524.08; y1: 533.08; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">, where a&#160;positive radiative forcing has a&#160;warming effect and a&#160;negative radiative forcing has a&#160;cooling effect. In response to these forcings, the Earth system will either warm or cool, so as to restore balance through changes in the amount of outgoing thermal radiation (the warmer the Earth, the more radiation it emits). Changes in Earth&#8217;s temperature in turn lead to additional changes in the climate system (known as </span><span style="x0: 115.05; x1: 119.05; y0: 476.09; y1: 485.09; width: 4.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="115.05" y0="476.09" x1="190.33">climate feedbacks</span><span x0="190.33" y0="476.09" x1="539.77" style="x0: 190.33; x1: 193.33; y0: 476.09; y1: 485.09; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">) that either amplify or dampen the original effect. For example, Arctic sea ice has been melting as the Earth warms, reducing the amount of reflected sunlight and adding to the initial warming (an&#160;amplifying feedback). The most uncertain of those climate feedbacks are clouds, as they respond to warming&#160;in complex ways that affect both the emission of thermal radiation and the reflection of sunlight. However, we are now more confident that cloud changes, taken together, will amplify climate warming (see&#160;FAQ&#160;7.2).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="410.1"><span x0="69.02" y0="410.1" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 410.1; y1: 419.1; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Human activities have unbalanced these energy flows in two main ways. First, increases in greenhouse gas levels have led to more of the emitted thermal radiation being absorbed by the atmosphere, instead of being released to space. Second, increases in pollutants have increased the amount of aerosols such as sulphates in the atmosphere (see FAQ 6.1). This has led to more incoming sunlight being reflected away, by the aerosols themselves and through the formation of more cloud drops, which increases the reflectivity of clouds (see FAQ&#160;7.2).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.74" top="344.11"><span x0="69.02" y0="344.11" x1="539.74" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 344.11; y1: 353.11; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Altogether, the global energy flow imbalance since the 1970s has been just over half a&#160;watt per square metre of the Earth&#8217;s surface. This sounds small, but because the imbalance is persistent and because Earth&#8217;s surface is large, this adds up to about 25 times the total amount of primary energy consumed by human society, compared over 1971 to 2018. Compared to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), we are now better able to quantify and track these energy flows from multiple lines of evidence, including satellite data, direct measurements of ocean temperatures, and a&#160;wide variety of other Earth system observations (see FAQ 1.1). We also have a&#160;better understanding of the processes contributing to this imbalance, including the complex interactions between aerosols, clouds and radiation.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="242.13"><span x0="69.02" y0="242.13" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 242.13; y1: 251.13; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Research has shown that the excess energy since the 1970s has mainly gone into warming the ocean (91%), followed by the warming of land (5%) and the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (3%). The atmosphere has warmed substantially since 1970, but because it is comprised of thin gases it has absorbed only 1% of the excess energy (FAQ 7.1, Figure&#160;1). As the ocean has absorbed the vast majority of the excess energy, especially within its top two kilometres, the deep ocean is expected to continue to warm and expand for centuries to millennia, leading to long-term sea level rise&#160;&#8211; even if atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were to decline (see FAQ 5.3). This&#160;is in addition to the sea level rise expected from melting ice sheets and glaciers.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="152.15"><span x0="69.02" y0="152.15" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 152.15; y1: 161.15; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Understanding the Earth&#8217;s energy budget&#160;al.o helps to narrow uncertainty in future projections of climate. By&#160;testing climate models against what we know about the Earth&#8217;s energy budget, we can make more confident projections of surface temperature changes we might expect this century and beyond.</span></div></body></html>
