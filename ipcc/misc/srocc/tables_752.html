      <td>some 3 billion people worldwide (IEA 2017). Traditional biomass has high land and climate impacts, with significant harvesting losses,\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil impacts and high conversion losses (Cutz et al. 2017b; Masera et al. 2015; Ghilardi et al. 2016a;\nBailis et al. 2015; Fritsche et al. 2017; Mudombi et al. 2018b). In addition to these impacts, indoor air pollution from household cooking\nis a leading cause of mortality in low- and medium-income countries and especially affects women and children (Smith et al. 2014a;\nHEI/IHME 2018; Goldemberg et al. 2018b). In rural areas, the significant time needed for gathering fuelwood imposes further costs on\nwomen and children (Njenga and Mendum 2018; Gurung and Oh 2013a; Behera et al. 2015a).</td>

      <td>Both agricultural and woody biomass can be upgraded and used sustainably through improved resource management and modern\nconversion technologies, providing much greater energy output per unit of biomass (Cutz et al. 2017b; Hoffmann et al. 2015a; Gurung\nand Oh 2013b). More relevant than technical efficiency is the improved quality of energy services: with increasing income levels\nand/or access to technologies, households transition over time from agricultural residues and fuelwood to charcoal and then to\ngaseous or liquid fuels and electricity (Leach 1992; Pachauri and Jiang 2008; Goldemberg and Teixeira Coelho 2004; Smeets et al.\n2012a). However, most households use multiple stoves and/or fuels at the same time, known as &#8216;fuel stacking&#8217; for economic flexibility\nand also for socio-cultural reasons (Ruiz-Mercado and Masera 2015a; Cheng and Urpelainen 2014; Takama et al. 2012).</td>

      <td>use may often involve semi-processed fuels, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where charcoal is the primary urban cooking fuel.\nRapid urbanisation and/or commercialisation drives a shift from fuelwood to charcoal, which results in significantly higher wood use\n(very high confidence) due to losses in charcoal supply chains and the tendency to use whole trees for charcoal production (Santos\net al. 2017; World Bank. 2009a; Hojas-Gascon et al. 2016a; Smeets et al. 2012b). One study in Myanmar found that charcoal required\n23 times the land area of fuelwood (Win et al. 2018). In areas of woody biomass scarcity, animal dung and agricultural residues, as\nwell as lower-quality wood, are often used (Kumar Nath et al. 2013a; Go et al. 2019a; Jagger and Kittner 2017; Behera et al. 2015b).\nThe fraction of woody biomass harvested that is not &#8216;demonstrably renewable&#8217; is the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) under\nUNFCCC accounting; default values for fNRB for least-developed countries and small island developing states ranged from 40&#8211;100%\n(CDM Executive Board 2012). Uncertainties in woodfuel data, complexities in spatiotemporal woodfuel modelling and rapid forest\nregrowth in some tropical regions present sources of variation in such estimates, and some fNRB values are likely to have been\noverestimated (McNicol et al. 2018a; Ghilardi et al. 2016b; Bailis et al. 2017b).</td>

The estimate only includes woody biomass and does not account for possible losses in soil\ncarbon or the effects of nutrient losses from use of animal dung, which can be significant in some cases (Duguma et al. 2014a; Achat\net al. 2015a; S&#225;nchez et al. 2016). Reducing emissions of black carbon alongside GHG reductions offers immediate health co-benefits\n(Shindell et al. 2012; Pandey et al. 2017; Weyant et al. 2019a; Sparrevik et al. 2015). Significant GHG emissions reductions, depending\non baseline or reference use, can be obtained through fuel-switching to gaseous and liquid fuels, sustainable harvesting of woodfuels,\nupgrading to efficient stoves, and adopting high-quality processed fuels such as wood pellets (medium evidence, high agreement)\n(Wathore et al. 2017; Jagger and Das 2018; Quinn et al. 2018; Cutz et al. 2017b; Carter et al. 2018; Bailis et al. 2015; Ghilardi et al.\n2018; Weyant et al. 2019b; Hoffmann et al. 2015b).</td>

In Sub-Saharan Africa and in some other regions, land degradation is widely\nassociated with charcoal production (high confidence), often in combination with timber harvesting or clearing land for agriculture</td>
