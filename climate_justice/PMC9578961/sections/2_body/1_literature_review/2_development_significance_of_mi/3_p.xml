This rural bank was founded in 1976 in the Indian subcontinent by Muhammad Yunus &#8211; Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 2006. Yunus was determined in solving the non-bankability of the poor and those excluded from the traditional credit system. Therefore, he conceived the implementation of informal credit channels for these new customers. The Grameen Bank has, in fact, become the first &#8220;village bank&#8221; to promote financial services to the poor, proposing a pragmatic alternative to usury and charity (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Yunus, 1998</xref>).</p>
