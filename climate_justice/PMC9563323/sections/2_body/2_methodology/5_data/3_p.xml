<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For Corpus 1, we identified two main sources of online, publicly available text reflecting governmental and public-facing plastics-oriented discourse: webpages from UK campaigns on recycling and plastic information (namely &#8216;Recycle Now&#8217; and &#8216;Clear on Plastics&#8217;); and guidance from the UK government on refuse disposal across different local authority areas (&#8216;Gov.uk&#8217; council webpages). For Recycle Now and Clear on Plastics, the websites were small enough that it was possible to manually identify the sections of the websites deemed relevant to this work. The URLs for these pages were then fed into a freely available corpus-building program, BootCat,<fn id="j_jwl-2022-0017_fn_008"><label>8</label><p>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://bootcat.dipintra.it/" ext-link-type="uri">https://bootcat.dipintra.it/</ext-link> (accessed 6 May 2021).</p></fn> which scraped the text from the webpages and exported it to files that could then be cleaned, tagged, and added to the Corpus 1 collection. BootCat is typically used to build a corpus from scratch, i.e. by specifying key terms of interest (&#8216;seeds&#8217;) which it then combines randomly into search queries (&#8216;tuples&#8217;) to be used in Google searches to generate the relevant URLs, and this is how we used BootCat to collect the data from the &#8216;Gov.uk&#8217; webpages (see <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_app_001" ref-type="app">Appendix A</xref> for the list of tuples used).</p>
