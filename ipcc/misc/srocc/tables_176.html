      <td>observational-based estimates of fluxes due to changes in forest area (e.g., Tyukavina et al. (2015), Harris et al. (2015) and Baccini et al.\n(2012) or degradation (Baccini et al. 2017)). Satellite estimates of biomass vary considerably (Mitchard et al. 2013; Saatchi et al. 2015;\nAvitabile et al. 2016): data are available only for recent decades, methods generally assume that all losses of carbon are immediately\nreleased to the atmosphere and changes in soil carbon are generally ignored. The approach implicitly includes indirect and natural\ndisturbance effects as well as direct anthropogenic effects.</td>

      <td>Atmospheric inversions use observations of atmospheric concentrations with a model of atmospheric transport, based on\ndata for wind speed and direction, to calculate implied emissions (Gatti et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017a; van der Laan-Luijkx et al. 2017).\nSince AR5, there has been an increase in availability of concentration data from flux tower networks and satellites, enabling better\nglobal coverage at finer spatial scales and some national estimates (e.g., in the UK inverse techniques are used together with\nnational GHG inventories). A combination of concentrations of different gases and isotopes enables the separation of fossil, ocean and\nland fluxes. However, inversions give only the net flux of CO from land; they cannot separate natural and anthropogenic fluxes.\n2</td>

      <td>FAOSTAT has produced country level estimates of GHG emissions (Tubiello et al. 2013) from agriculture (1961&#8211;2016) and land\nuse (1990&#8211;2016) using a globally consistent methodological approach based largely on IPCC Tier 1 methods of the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines (FAO 2015). FAO emissions estimates were used as one of the three database inputs into the AR5 WGIII AFOLU chapter.\nNon-CO emissions from agriculture are estimated directly from national statistics of activity data reported by countries to FAO.\n2\nCO emissions from land use and land-use change are computed mostly at Tier 1, albeit at fine geospatial scales to capture effects\n2\nfrom peatland degradation and biomass fires (Rossi et al. 2016). Emissions from forest land and deforestation are based on the\nIPCC carbon stock change method, thus constituting a Tier 3 estimate relying on country statistics of carbon stocks and forest area\ncollected through the FAO FRA. The carbon flux is estimated assuming instantaneous emissions in the year of forest area loss and\nchanges in carbon stocks within extant forests, but does not distinguish &#8216;managed&#8217; and &#8216;unmanaged&#8217; forest areas, albeit it treats\nseparately emissions from primary, secondary and planted forest (Federici et al. 2015).</td>

      <td>Country Reporting of GHG Inventories (GHGIs): All parties to the UNFCCC are required to report national GHGIs of anthropogenic\nemissions and removals. Reporting requirements are differentiated between developed and developing countries. Because of the\ndifficulty of separating direct anthropogenic fluxes from indirect or natural fluxes, the IPCC (2003) adopted the &#8216;managed land&#8217;\nconcept as a proxy to facilitate GHGI reporting. All GHG fluxes on &#8216;managed land&#8217; are defined as anthropogenic, with each country\napplying their own definition of &#8216;managed land&#8217; (i.e., &#8216;where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform\nproduction, ecological or social functions&#8217; (IPCC 2006)). Fluxes may be determined on the basis of changes in carbon stocks (e.g.,\nfrom forest inventories) or by activity data (e.g., area of land cover change management activity multiplied by emission factors or with\nmodelled fluxes). Depending on the specific methods used, GHGIs include all direct anthropogenic effects and may include the indirect\nanthropogenic effects of environmental change (generally sinks) and natural effects (Section 2.3.1.2). GHG fluxes from &#8216;unmanaged\nland&#8217; are not reported in GHGIs because they are assumed to be non-anthropogenic. The reported estimates may then be filtered\nthrough agreed &#8216;accounting rules&#8217; (i.e., what countries actually count towards their mitigation targets (Cowie et al. 2007; Lee and Sanz\n2017). The accounting aims to better quantify the additional mitigation actions by, for example, factoring out the impact of natural\ndisturbances and forest age-related dynamics (Canadell et al. 2007; Grassi et al. 2018).</td>
