The first model, revealing the relationship between SUHI intensity and the percentage of each population group by census tract, sets SUHI intensity in areas of a city with no population (zero for all groups) equal to 2.05 K hotter on average than the background temperature, based on the intercept of the model. Therefore, areas located within the city are on average are 2.05 K warmer than their background environment and each demographic group&#8217;s prevalent tracts (and the populations within them) are exposed to differing levels of SUHI intensities. For each one standard deviation increase in the White population (26.69%) for a census tract, SUHI intensity tends to decrease by 0.25 K on average. Standard deviation increases in the Black population (23.44%) witness SUHI intensity increases of 0.42 K on average. Hispanic increases in percentage by 23.02% saw an SUHI intensity increase of 0.23 K and on average, an 11.50% increase in the Asian population saw an increase in SUHI intensity by 0.14 K.</p>
