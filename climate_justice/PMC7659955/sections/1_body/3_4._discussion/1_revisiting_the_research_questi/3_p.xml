For instance, tremendous success was recorded by the IEEE smart village initiative; the EU smart village-drive, as well as the CCACFS projects, to mention a few. By adopting the recipe for success within these projects, more smart-village projects would be actualized in many parts of the world. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to state that existing smart village projects also have unique challenges. Notable amongst the challenges faced by smart villages within the IEEE project is the issue of maintenance and repairs [<xref rid="B96-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Although as part of the project framework, two individuals are often selected and trained within the villages to fix damaged smart inputs, when demands for these inputs become high, the number of technicians might no longer be sufficient to cater for repair and maintenance needs. This is one aspect where smart village development must learn from climate-smart ideas where capacity development is well-planned and readily available.</p>
