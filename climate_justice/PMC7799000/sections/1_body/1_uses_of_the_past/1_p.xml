<bold>D<sc>Hody</sc>:</bold> I'm the only curator at the M&#252;tter Museum, so I have to wear many hat's and I'm up-front about the fact that my skill set doesn't necessarily translate to being good at all of those jobs. I'm a forensic anthropologist by training. I'm interested in looking at the material culture, including the physical specimens that date back to the early 1800s. These specimens had been used to passively educate, meaning that people would look at their gross morphology and learn, perhaps, how to identify a lung from an influenza victim or how to look at a the lesions on a piece of human intestine and say that person may have had cholera. Very important.</p>
