<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">From the theoretical perspective outlined above, <italic>social identities</italic> can be addressed in the context of politicized social identities or as global identification linked to an attitude of solidarity toward those suffering from the climate crisis. A <italic>politicized social identity</italic> could only be coded specifically in relation with E.&#8217;s first-time participation in collective action. At the time of the interviews, however, all of the interviewees spoke of their own initiatives in the &#8220;we&#8221; form, so that at some points it was necessary to ask more detailed questions whether the interviewees were talking about activities in which they themselves were involved or which were supported by other group members. Apparently, they had strongly internalized their group membership and acted as representatives of their initiatives. Based on their involvement, they had developed a kind of ownership of their projects (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Greving et al., 2020</xref>). An attitude of solidarity toward people suffering from climate change, as discussed in the literature, could not be coded in any of the interview transcripts.</p>
