I&#160;will then reflect on the cruise ship as a&#160;metaphor for a&#160;global capitalism that subordinates people, urban space, and the environment to economic logic. This is also where the transnational dimension of social resistance against cruise infrastructures and tourism is highlighted, as it has clearly European scope. Since it is important to examine these conflicts in their historical dimension, I&#160;will then outline the local development and draw attention to the effects of contested cruise infrastructures, which deeply influence structures and rhythms on water as well as on land. Finally, I&#160;will focus on direct action by the committee, its embodied knowledge, and the transnational relations it established.</p>
