<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A <em>climate prediction</em> typically proceeds by integrating a <em>climate model</em> forward in time from an initial state that is intended to reflect the actual state of the <em>climate system</em>.</p>
<p>Available observations of the climate system are assimilated into the model. Initialization is a complex process that is limited by available observations, observational errors and, depending on the procedure used, may be affected by <em>uncertainty</em> in the history of <em>climate</em> forcing. The initial conditions will contain errors that grow as the forecast progresses, thereby limiting the time period over which the forecast will be useful.</p>
