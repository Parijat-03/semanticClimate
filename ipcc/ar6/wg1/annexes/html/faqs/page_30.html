As the Arctic region warms faster than anywhere else on Earth, there are concerns that this warming could release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and therefore significantly amplify climate change.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="533.66"><span x0="69.02" y0="533.66" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 533.66; y1: 542.66; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The carbon in the permafrost has built up over thousands of years, as dead plants have been buried and accumulated within layers of frozen soil, where the cold prevents the organic material from decomposing. As the Arctic warms and soils thaw, the organic matter in these soils begins to decompose rapidly and return to the atmosphere as either carbon dioxide or methane, which are both important greenhouse gases. Permafrost can also thaw abruptly in a&#160;given place, due to melting ice in the ground reshaping Arctic landscapes, lakes growing and draining, and fires burning away insulating surface soil layers. Thawing of permafrost carbon has already been observed in the Arctic, and climate models project that much of the shallow permafrost (&lt;3&#160;m&#160;depth) throughout the Arctic would thaw under moderate to high amounts of global warming (2&#176;C&#8211;4&#176;C).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.84" top="431.68"><span x0="69.02" y0="431.68" x1="539.84" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 431.68; y1: 440.68; width: 9.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">While permafrost processes are complex, they are beginning to be included in models that represent the interactions between the climate and the carbon cycle. The projections from these permafrost carbon models show a&#160;wide range in the estimated strength of a&#160;carbon&#8211;climate vicious circle, from both carbon dioxide and methane, equivalent to 14&#8211;175 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide released per 1&#176;C of global warming. By comparison, in 2019, human activities have released about 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has two implications. First, the extra warming caused by permafrost thawing is strong enough that it must be considered when estimating the total amount of remaining emissions permitted to stabilize the climate at a&#160;given level of global warming (i.e.,&#160;the remaining carbon budget, see FAQ 5.4). Second, the models do not identify any one amount of warming at which permafrost thaw becomes a&#160;&#8216;tipping point&#8217; or threshold in the climate system that would lead to a&#160;runaway global warming. However, models do project that emissions would continuously increase with warming, and that this trend could last for hundreds of years.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.79" top="293.71"><span x0="69.02" y0="293.71" x1="539.79" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 293.71; y1: 302.71; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Permafrost can also be found in other cold places (e.g.,&#160;mountain ranges), but those places contain much less carbon than in the Arctic. For instance, the Tibetan plateau contains about 3% as much carbon as is stored in the Arctic. There is also concern about carbon frozen in shallow ocean sediments.

They&#160;formed as frozen soils that were flooded when sea levels rose after the last ice age. If these hydrates thaw, they may release methane that can bubble up to the surface. The total amount of carbon in permafrost-associated methane hydrates is much less than the carbon in permafrost soils. Global warming takes millennia to penetrate into the sediments beneath the ocean, which is why these hydrates are still responding to the last deglaciation. As a&#160;result, only a&#160;small fraction of the existing hydrates could be destabilised during the coming century. Even when methane is released from hydrates, most of it is expected to be consumed and oxidised into carbon dioxide in the ocean before reaching the atmosphere. The most complete modelling of these processes to date suggests a&#160;release to the atmosphere at a&#160;rate of less than 2% of current human-induced methane emissions.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.77" top="143.75"><span x0="69.02" y0="143.75" x1="539.77" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 76.03; y0: 143.75; y1: 152.75; width: 7.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Overall, thawing permafrost in the Arctic appears to be an important additional source of heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, more so than undersea hydrates. Climate and carbon cycle models are beginning to consider permafrost processes. While these models disagree on the exact amount of the heat-trapping gases that will&#160;be released into the atmosphere, they agree that: (i) the amount of such gases released from permafrost will increase with the amount of global warming; and (ii) the warming effect of thawing permafrost is significant enough to be considered in estimates of the remaining carbon budgets for limiting future warming.</span></div></body></html>
