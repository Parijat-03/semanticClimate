Climate finance is obligatory for developed countries under the Paris Agreement (with the language &#8220;shall provide&#8221;), and the Convention in certain terms differentiates it as having to be &#8220;new and additional, adequate and predictable&#8221; (Article 4.3). But ODA is voluntary. However, the PVCs suffer from both development and adaptation deficits (Burton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Fankhauser and Mcdermott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>). This allows some developed countries the wiggle room to blur the qualitative difference between the two. While ODA is declining (Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>), climate finance is increasing (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>), significantly displacing ODA. Now, 26% of ODA is used as climate finance, an increase of 37% compared to 2014 (Development Tracker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). But ODA is vitally needed for the provision of basic services for the poor and for infrastructure development. More discussion on adaptation vs. development will follow.</p>
