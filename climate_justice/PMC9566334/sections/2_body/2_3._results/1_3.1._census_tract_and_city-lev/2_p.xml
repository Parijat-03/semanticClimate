<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Descriptive statistics for mean yearly summertime SUHI intensity for the census tracts after grouping by prevalence are shown in <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The mean SUHI intensity for White prevalent tracts is 1.46 K with Black and Hispanic prevalent tracts statistically significantly higher at 3.08 K and 3.15 K respectively. SUHI intensity in Asian prevalent tracts (2.73 K) was also higher than White prevalent tracts but is not statistically significant based on the Kolmogorov&#8211;Smirnov test. The maximums for all groups were within 1 K of each other but White has a lower minimum value than the alternative prevalent tracts.</p>
