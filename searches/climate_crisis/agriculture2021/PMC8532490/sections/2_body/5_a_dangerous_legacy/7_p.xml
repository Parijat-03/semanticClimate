This concern is being borne out. The UN Secretary-General&#8217;s (UNSG) Chair Summary and Statement of Action on the UN Food Systems Summit on 23 September 2021 lays out the post Summit plans for food systems transformation a&#8217;la the &#8216;Great Reset&#8217;. It proposes a new governance structure coordinated through a hub led by the Rome based Agencies FAO, IFAD and WFP to follow up UNFSS outcomes, with partners and &#8216;champions&#8217; that include corporations, civil society, and &#8216;experts.&#8217; Shining through the verbiage of sustainability, transformation, resilience, interconnectedness, etc. is the model of stakeholder capitalism in food systems governance through MSIs, private financing, global trade and investment, innovation and &#8216;science-based&#8217; solutions. In stakeholder capitalism, corporations claim to create value for all the stakeholders involved in their operations, not only their shareholders, ensuring long term financial gains. It is a key motif in the WEF&#8217;s Great Reset.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref></p>
