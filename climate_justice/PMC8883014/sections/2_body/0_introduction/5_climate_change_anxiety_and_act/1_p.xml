This is consistent with historical trends in which young adults have often led major social change movements (Franklin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>). Reimer (2013) argued that young adults are the ideal target for engaging in environmental activism because of their developmental stage, environmental knowledge, and ability to be effective messengers. At the same time, young people&#8217;s activism can also be stigmatized; for example, newspapers in the United States discussing climate change depict youth alternately as demanding activists, adultified kids, innocent victims, or ultimate saviors (Benoit et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>).</p>
