## Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon May 2023

#semanticClimate ran its first ever hybrid Hackathon on 2023-05-19. After the inaugural session, we divided ourselves into 4 smaller groups of 5. Each focused on a specific component of Climate Knowledge Explorer. 

Group 01 looked at key phrase extraction; Group 02 worked on building a summarizer; Group 03 focused on Wikibase, dictionary creation and information extraction; and Group 04 worked on finding out why a paragraph of the report refernced a different paragraph (linking attributes).
