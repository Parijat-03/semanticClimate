As the climate moves away from its past and current states, we will experience extreme events that are unprecedented, either in magnitude, frequency, timing or location. The frequency of these unprecedented extreme events will rise with increasing global warming. Additionally, the combined occurrence of multiple unprecedented extremes may result in large and unprecedented impacts.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="588.22"><span x0="69.02" y0="588.22" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 588.22; y1: 597.22; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Human-induced climate change has already affected many aspects of the climate system. In addition to the increase in global surface temperature, many types of weather and climate extremes have changed. In most regions, the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased and those of cold extremes have decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased at the&#160;global scale and over a&#160;majority of land regions. Although extreme events such as land and marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, drought, tropical cyclones, and associated wildfires and coastal flooding have occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future, they often come with different magnitudes or frequencies in a&#160;warmer world. For example, future heatwaves will last longer and have higher temperatures, and future extreme precipitation events will be more intense in several regions. Certain extremes, such as extreme cold, will be less intense and less frequent with increasing warming. </span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.76" top="474.25"><span x0="69.02" y0="474.25" x1="539.76" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 474.25; y1: 483.25; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Unprecedented extremes&#160;&#8211; that is, events not experienced in the past&#160;&#8211; will occur in the future in five different ways (FAQ 11.2, Figure&#160;1). First, events that are considered to be extreme in the current climate will occur in the future with unprecedented magnitudes. Second, future extreme events will also occur with unprecedented frequency. Third, certain types of extremes may occur in regions that have not previously encountered those types of events. For example, as the sea level rises, coastal flooding may occur in new locations, and wildfires are already occurring in areas, such as parts of the Arctic, where the probability of such events was previously low. Fourth, extreme events may also be unprecedented in their timing. For example, extremely hot temperatures may occur either earlier or later in the year than they have in the past.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="539.79" top="372.27"><span x0="309.54" y0="372.27" x1="539.79" style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.04; y0: 372.27; y1: 381.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Finally, compound events&#160;&#8211; where multiple extreme events of either different or similar types occur simultaneously and/or in succession&#160;&#8211; may be more probable or severe in the future. These compound events can often impact ecosystems and societies more strongly than when such events occur in isolation. For example, a&#160;drought along with extreme heat will increase the risk of wildfires and agriculture damages or losses. As individual extreme events become more severe as a&#160;result of climate change, the combined occurrence of these events will create unprecedented compound events. This could exacerbate the intensity and associated impacts of these extreme events.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="539.81" top="210.3"><span x0="309.54" y0="210.3" x1="539.81" style="x0: 309.54; x1: 316.04; y0: 210.3; y1: 219.3; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Unprecedented extremes have already occurred in recent years, relative to the 20th&#160;century climate. Some recent extreme hot events would have had very little chance of occurring without human influence on the climate (see FAQ 11.3). In the future, unprecedented extremes will occur as the climate continues to warm. Those extremes will happen with larger magnitudes and at higher frequencies than previously experienced. Extreme events may also appear in new locations, at new times of the year, or as unprecedented compound events. Moreover, unprecedented events will become more frequent with higher levels of warming, for example at 3&#176;C of global warming compared to 2&#176;C of </span></div><div left="79.24" right="129.66" top="365.37"><span x0="79.24" y0="365.37" x1="129.66" style="x0: 79.24; x1: 85.78; y0: 365.37; y1: 376.08; width: 6.55; font-size: 10.71; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: LAGTEC+ArialMT;">FAQ 11.2: </span><span style="x0: 129.66; x1: 139.77; y0: 364.82; y1: 375.54; width: 10.11; font-size: 10.71; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="129.66" y0="364.82" x1="265.32">Will climate change cause unprecedented extremes? </span></div><div left="126.3" right="223.82" top="336.54"><span x0="126.3" y0="336.54" x1="223.82" style="x0: 126.3; x1: 131.66; y0: 336.54; y1: 344.57; width: 5.36; font-size: 8.04; fill: [0.516, 0.431, 0.431, 0.075]; font-family: LAGTEC+ArialMT;">Yes, in a changing climate, extreme events may be unprecedented when they occur with...</span></div><div left="126.3" right="194.16" top="291.75"><span style="x0: 126.3; x1: 131.21; y0: 291.75; y1: 299.78; width: 4.91; font-size: 8.04; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.3" y0="291.75" x1="194.16">Larger magnitude</span></div><div left="126.3" right="204.45" top="243.14"><span style="x0: 126.3; x1: 128.53; y0: 243.14; y1: 251.17; width: 2.23; font-size: 8.03; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.3" y0="243.14" x1="204.45">Increased frequency</span></div><div left="126.3" right="180.33" top="194.68"><span style="x0: 126.3; x1: 132.1; y0: 194.68; y1: 202.71; width: 5.8; font-size: 8.03; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.3" y0="194.68" x1="180.33">New locations</span></div><div left="126.3" right="185.67" top="147.36"><span style="x0: 126.3; x1: 132.1; y0: 147.36; y1: 155.39; width: 5.8; font-size: 8.03; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.3" y0="147.36" x1="185.67">Different timing</span></div><div left="126.3" right="199.52" top="99.31"><span style="x0: 126.3; x1: 132.1; y0: 99.31; y1: 107.35; width: 5.8; font-size: 8.03; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.3" y0="99.31" x1="199.52">New combinations </span><span x0="199.52" y0="99.72" x1="242.39" style="x0: 199.52; x1: 202.2; y0: 99.72; y1: 107.76; width: 2.68; font-size: 8.03; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.4]; font-family: LAGTEC+ArialMT;">(compound)</span></div><div left="69.02" right="279.45" top="64.98"><span style="x0: 69.02; x1: 72.73; y0: 64.98; y1: 72.98; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: AJXIUY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="69.02" y0="64.98" x1="279.45">FAQ 11.2, Figure&#160;1 | New types of unprecedented extremes that </span></div></body></html>
