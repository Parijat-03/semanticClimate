On-farm adaptation options include increased soil organic matter and erosion control in cropland, improved livestock and grazing land management, and transition to different species, polyculture and integrated systems in aquaculture. Crop and livestock genetic improvements include tolerance to heat, drought, and pests and diseases. Food transport, storage, trade, and processing will likely play increasingly important roles in adapting to climate change-induced food insecurity.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="202.59" top="471.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 471.42; y1: 481.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="471.42" x1="202.59">1.3.4 Demand-side adaptation</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="447.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 447.52; y1: 457.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="447.52" x1="307.57">Adaptation in the demand side of the food system involves consumption practices, diets, and reducing food loss and waste. Recent studies showed that supply-side adaptation measures alone will not be suf&#64257;cient to sustainably achieve food security under climate change (Springmann et al. 2018b; Swinburn et al. 2019; Baj&#382;elj et al. 2014). As noted by Godfray (2015), people with higher income demand more varied diets, and typically ones that are richer in meat and other food types that require more resources to produce. Therefore, both supply-side (production, processing, transport, and trade) and demand-side solutions (for example, changing diets, food loss and waste reduction) can be effective in adapting to climate change (Creutzig et al. 2016) (see Section&#160;5.5.2.5 for food loss and waste). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="291.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 291.54; y1: 301.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="291.54" x1="307.59">The implications of dietary choice can have severe consequences for land. For example, Alexander et al. (2016), found that if every country were to adopt the UK&#8217;s 2011 average diet and meat consumption, 95% of global habitable land area would be needed for agriculture&#160;&#8211; up from 50% of land currently used. For the average USA diet, 178% of global land would be needed (relative to 2011) (Alexander et al. 2016); and for &#8216;business as usual&#8217; dietary trends and existing rates of improvement in yields, 55% more land would be needed above baseline (2009) (Baj&#382;elj et al. 2014). Changing dietary habits have been suggested as an effective food route to affect land use (Beheshti et al. 2017) and promote adaptation to climate change through food demand. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.63" top="147.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.92; y0: 147.56; y1: 157.06; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="147.56" x1="307.63">Most literature has focused on demand-side options that analyse the effects on climate change mitigation by dietary changes. Little focus has been brought on demand-side adaptation measures to adjust the demand to the food challenges related to drivers such as market, climate change, inputs limitations (for example, fossil fuels, nitrogen, phosphorus), food access, and quality. Adding to that, the high cost of nutritious foods contributes to a&#160;higher risk of overweight and obesity (FAO 2018d). Adaptation measures relate also to the </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.16; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.58" x1="566.11">implications of easy access to inexpensive, high-calorie, low-nutrition foods which have been shown to lead to malnutrition (Section&#160;5.1).

For example, replacing beef in the USA diet with poultry can meet caloric and protein demands of about 120 to 140&#160;million additional people consuming the average American diet (Shepon et al. 2016). Similar suggestions are made for adopting the bene&#64257;ts of moving to plant-based protein, such as beans (Harwatt et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.11" top="543.54"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 322.26; y0: 543.54; y1: 553.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="543.54" x1="566.11">The main reason why reducing meat consumption is an adaptation measure is because it reduces pressure on land and water and thus our vulnerability to climate change and inputs limitations (Vanham et al. 2013). For animal feed, ruminants can have positive ecological effects (species diversity, soil carbon) if they are fed extensively on existing grasslands. Similarly, reducing waste at all points along the entire food chain is a&#160;signi&#64257;cant opportunity for improving demand-side adaptation measures (Godfray 2015). </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.07" top="435.55"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 320.34; y0: 435.55; y1: 445.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="435.55" x1="566.07">It is important to highlight the opportunities for improving the feed-to-meat conversion considered as a&#160;form of food loss. However, the unique capacity of ruminants to produce high-quality food from low-quality forage, in particular from landscapes that cannot be cropped and from cellulosic biomass that humans cannot digest could be seen as an effective way to improve the feed:meat ratio (Cawthorn and Hoffman 2015). </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.08" top="339.55"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 320.34; y0: 339.55; y1: 349.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="339.55" x1="566.08">In summary, there is potential for demand-side adaptation, such as adoption of diets low in animal-sourced products, in conjunction with reduction in food loss and waste to contribute to reduction in food demand, land sparing, and thus need for adaptation. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="451.02" top="267.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 267.42; y1: 277.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="267.42" x1="451.02">1.3.5 Institutional measures</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="243.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 243.52; y1: 253.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="243.52" x1="566.07">To facilitate the scaling up of adaptation throughout the food system, institutional measures are needed at global, regional, national, and local levels (Section&#160;5.7). Institutional aspects, including policies and laws, depend on scale and context. International institutions (&#64257;nancial and policies) are driving many aspects of global food systems (for example, UN agencies, international private sector agribusinesses and retailers). Many others operate at local level and strongly in&#64258;uence livelihoods and markets of smallholder farmers.
