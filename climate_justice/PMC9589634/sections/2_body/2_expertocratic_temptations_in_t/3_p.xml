In the climate policy discourse, by contrast, it is individual voices from science and in parts the public communication of social movements that reveal such a temptation. In general, expertocratic demands have a certain tradition in environmental policy thinking. Linked to the diagnosis that democratic systems are not capable of dealing with serious environmental problems, such demands appeared early on, for example in Heilbroner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1974</xref>) and Ophuls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1977</xref>). Most notably, natural scientist James Lovelock questioned the performance of democratic systems by drawing a war analogy: &#8216;climate change may be an issue as severe as war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while&#8217; (Lovelock quoted in Hickman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> For Shearman and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>, p. 85), it is above all the short-term thinking and the self-interest of representatives, who almost exclusively have their re-election in mind, that disqualifies liberal democracy as an effective system for halting climate change. In the current debate, the Fridays for Future slogan &#8216;follow the science&#8217; expresses understandable frustration with many years of political denial of scientific findings and the above-mentioned delaying tactics of powerful lobbies. It rightly urges a policy based on scientific facts. But in its literal reading, it forgets that science cannot lead politically or even exercise legitimate political power.</p>
