<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para250">It is already evident from the COVID-19 pandemic and past zoonotic disease outbreaks (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4&#8211;7</xref>) that human interactions with nature and wildlife are inextricably linked to human health. Efficient actions are urgently required to address the pandemic's direct and indirect threats to biodiversity and ecosystems to prevent the aggravation of the drivers of zoonotic disease, including land-use change, wildlife trade, intensive livestock production, and climate change (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11&#8211;21</xref>). These actions are essential to avoid feedback loops that can lead to future zoonotic disease emergence and possible resulting pandemics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Efforts to address COVID-19's many effects on biodiversity and ecosystem health are insufficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). This gap largely results from insufficient understanding of the interconnectedness of human and environmental health among policy makers, insufficient cross-boundary collaboration, and deficient resourcing for conservation and ecosystem health. We therefore outline below some key actions that should be taken to mitigate future occurrence.</p>
