It is critical to understand that for environmentalists from historically underrepresented communities, there are stereotypes and biases that they face on a daily basis, which have emotional and professional impacts. In an attempt to undo some of those stereotypes and build empathy and understanding, the BGC interview questions focus on humanizing the guest and allowing them to express their emotions in a way that is true to their beliefs and personality.</p>
