<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One assumption we have in our paper is that the location of rural working people in the spheres of production and social reproduction shapes one&#8217;s position in relation to climate change (that is, whether one becomes vulnerable or not, and if so, to what extent is their vulnerability, and so on) amid climate change. In the rural areas, access to land can be a decisive factor in this context where, as Watts (<xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>/<xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) demonstrated in the case of Northern Nigeria, some prosper while others are differentiated out in times of severe climatic disruptions largely due to pre-existing structural condition and land access is key to this. The problem today is that current state of global land access is marked by widespread landlessness and near-landlessness of many rural working people, and precarious access by those who still have some land access. It is a highly uneven, inegalitarian distribution of land access, and many of the mainstream climate actions exacerbate this further. In turn, policies that promote land tenure security can only have democratic content if and when it has the fundamental elements of redistribution, recognition and restitution (Franco &amp; Borras, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), as we have demonstrated historically and through several illustrative country cases. This is key to a just transition, but the difficult challenge is that the contemporary global climate in land policy is too market-oriented, eschewing social justice-oriented redistributive approaches in land policies. This has to change.</p>
