<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The environmental and social effects of climate change have numerous indirect effects on health, including malnutrition and an increase in communicable and non-communicable diseases and impaired quality of life, and can even prove fatal. Higher temperatures can increase the incidence of food- and waterborne diseases through several mechanisms, such as encouraging better growth conditions for pathogenic microorganisms (for example, higher temperatures favour some bacteria causing gastrointestinal diseases, such as <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> spp. and <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacter</italic> spp.) and a change in patterns of exposure to sources of infection. For example, the increase in recreational use of water to cool down may encourage exposure to waterborne pathogens [<xref rid="B84-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Likewise, changes in the pattern of precipitation and temperature can encourage the growth and expansion of arthropod vectors, increasing risk of diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Zika; and can increase risk of the re-emergence of diseases such as the plague and hantavirus transmitted by reservoirs such as murids (mice and rats) [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Moreover, the expected effect of climate change on human migration could increase the number of imported cases of diseases that are non-endemic in our environment and that, in favourable conditions, could initiate cycles of autochthonous transmission.</p>
