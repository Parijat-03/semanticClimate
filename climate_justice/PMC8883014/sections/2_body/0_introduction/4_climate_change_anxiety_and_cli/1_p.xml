Research indicates that activism may protect against feelings of hopelessness in the context of overwhelming circumstances or when one&#8217;s future well-being is in jeopardy (DeAngelo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>). Engaging in collective action can&#160;also result in feelings of empowerment and social support (Flanagan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>; Gorski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>) with some research indicating it may be associated with better long-term mental health (Boehnke &amp; Wong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). At the same time, other research points to the psychological costs of activism, particularly activism related to personally-relevant issues (Chen &amp; Gorski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Engaging in climate activism typically means spending significant time thinking about climate change as well as devoting substantial psychological and/or material resources to a cause that, even in the best of circumstances, is likely to include extensive loss (Randall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>). This has the potential to leave activists feeling depleted and overwhelmed, contributing to anxiety and depression. Furthermore, when activism fails to achieve expected goals, this process may actually increase distress, anxiety, or despair (Albright &amp; Hurd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>; Kovan &amp; Dirkx, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>).</p>
