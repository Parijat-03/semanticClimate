The interactions between clouds and the climate are complex and varied. Clouds at low altitudes tend to reflect incoming solar energy back to space, creating a&#160;cooling effect by preventing this energy from reaching and warming the Earth. On the other hand, higher clouds tend to trap (i.e.,&#160;absorb and then emit at a&#160;lower temperature) some of the energy leaving the Earth, leading to a&#160;warming effect. On average, clouds reflect back more incoming energy than the amount of outgoing energy they trap, resulting in an overall net cooling effect on the present climate. Human activities since the pre-industrial era have altered this climate effect of clouds in two different ways: by changing the abundance of the aerosol particles in the atmosphere and by warming the Earth&#8217;s surface, primarily as a&#160;result of increases in greenhouse gas emissions.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="462.25"><span x0="69.02" y0="462.25" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 462.25; y1: 471.25; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere has markedly increased since the pre-industrial era, and this has had two important effects on clouds. First, clouds now reflect more incoming energy because cloud droplets have become more numerous and smaller. Second, smaller droplets may delay rain formation, thereby making the clouds last longer, although this effect remains uncertain. Hence, aerosols released by human activities have had a&#160;cooling effect, counteracting a&#160;considerable portion of the warming caused by increases in greenhouse gases over the last&#160;century (see FAQ 3.1). Nevertheless, this cooling effect is expected to diminish in the future, as air pollution policies progress worldwide, reducing the amount of aerosols released into the atmosphere.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="372.27"><span x0="69.02" y0="372.27" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 372.27; y1: 381.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Since the pre-industrial period, the Earth&#8217;s surface and atmosphere have warmed, altering the properties of clouds, such as their altitude, amount and composition (water or ice), thereby affecting the Earth&#8217;s energy budget and, in turn, changing temperature.

The problem stems from the fact that clouds can change in many ways and that their processes occur on much smaller scales than global climate models can explicitly represent. As a&#160;result, global climate models have disagreed on how clouds, particularly over the subtropical ocean, will change in the future and whether the change will amplify or suppress the global warming.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.77" top="270.29"><span x0="69.02" y0="270.29" x1="539.77" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 270.29; y1: 279.29; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Since the last IPCC Report in 2013 (the Fifth Assessment Report, or AR5), understanding of cloud processes has advanced with better observations, new analysis approaches and explicit high-resolution numerical simulation of clouds. Also, current global climate models simulate cloud behaviour better than previous models, due both to advances in computational capabilities and process understanding. Altogether, this has helped to build a&#160;more complete picture of how clouds will change as the climate warms (FAQ 7.2, Figure&#160;1). For example, the amount of low-clouds will reduce over the subtropical ocean, leading to less reflection of incoming solar energy, and the altitude of high-clouds will rise, making them more prone to trapping outgoing energy; both processes have a&#160;warming effect. In contrast, clouds in high latitudes will be increasingly made of water droplets rather than ice crystals. This shift from fewer, larger ice crystals to smaller but more numerous water droplets will result in more of the incoming solar energy being reflected back to space and produce a&#160;cooling effect. Better understanding of how clouds respond to warming has led to more confidence than before that future changes in clouds will, overall, cause additional warming (i.e., by weakening the current cooling effect of clouds).
