Similarly, broad classifications of vulnerability and exposure are often applied globally, with the same damage function used for all office buildings irrespective of construction type or location. Such &#8216;cookie-cutter&#8217; approaches to CRA are easy to scale and commoditise. However, this leads to information loss and hides critical local and time-horizon differences. In contrast, the humanitarian sector, where bottom-up assessments are common, often generates highly relevant local data such as prevailing sources of income and qualitative measures of adaptive capacity and livelihood resilience in a community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Such local data is crucial to accurately assessing the resilience of systems&#8212;for example, linking information on crop vulnerability to information on people&#8217;s livelihoods&#8212;but the cost of collecting these data is high and the typical one-off nature of projects in the humanitarian sector often leads to organisational memory loss and processes that are not scalable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
