<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate change can be sad and overwhelming for young people, particularly due to our powerlessness to fix the issue. Being involved in climate activist movements can help young people get past feelings of isolation and connect with others who have similar views about climate change. Being involved in collective action like protesting, legal challenges, and strikes can help channel our energy and rage and give us a shared sense of working together for a common goal. At the same time, there is a risk of young climate activists experiencing burnout, especially if we become disenfranchised with the movement and we feel that we aren't having an impact. Youth climate activist groups and networks like School Strike 4 Climate can offer us a shared space to connect with like&#8208;minded peers and &#8216;check&#8208;in&#8217; with each other. It is also important for young people to talk (and rant) about our feelings and experiences with people who support us, like parents, family, friends, and mentors who understand the issues. Humour can also help us diffuse our emotions.</p>
