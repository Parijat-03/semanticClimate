Nevertheless, it is essential to understand ecovillages as a process in which collective learning can be continuously (re)constructed, and not as a pre-formatted small-scale model of society. Primordial learning from these experiences, for instance, relies on ethical-political principles guided by diverse epistemological and ontological basis. This is because broader and inclusive cross-cultural alliances with diverse and marginalized social groups, together with the empirical knowledge and innovations interconnected to Earth&#8217;s life cycles, can contribute to expanding transition horizons for resistance and (re)existence, facing the complex contemporary challenges.</p>
