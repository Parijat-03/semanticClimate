Republicans are more likely to believe that climate change does not exist, is the result of natural processes, or is too costly to address (Hornsey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2016</xref>). Additionally, factors shown to influence climate attitudes (e.g., extreme weather experience and scientific knowledge) are moderated by partisanship (Shao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2017</xref>).&#160;Direct experience with extreme weather is perceived differently by Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, with Republicans typically understating the seriousness of their experiences, and Independents most sharply swinging with recent weather (Hamilton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2011</xref>; Hamilton and Stampone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2013</xref>; Shao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2017</xref>; Myers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>).</p>
