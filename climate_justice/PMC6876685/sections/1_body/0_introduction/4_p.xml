<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Taking up this question requires us to revisit what we mean by &#8220;climate literacy,&#8221; and to carefully consider what kind of climate literacy we hope students achieve in introductory science courses. As characterized by the United States (US) Global Change Research Program (<xref rid="ece35736-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), the &#8220;climate&#8208;literate person&#8221; possesses four literate features: She comprehends the core aspects of the planet's climate system; is ready to appraise climate&#8208;related information and make judgments about its credibility; meaningfully communicates about climate as well as climate change; and is prepared to respond appropriately to the realities of climate change (p. 4). This way of thinking about climate literacy reserves an important place for knowledge about climate, but it does not stop there. The &#8220;literacy&#8221; part of climate literacy encompasses comprehension, but also extends to a critical capacity to assess new information, and to responsively and responsibly intervene in the world, acting on&#8212;and in response to&#8212;knowledge about climate. After all, when we talk about &#8220;literacy&#8221; in other contexts, this word designates not just the ability to <italic>read</italic> and process content, but also to <italic>write</italic>&#8212;acting on, extending, and recomposing information. A higher level of climate literacy might therefore be described as students understanding the causes and consequences of climate change <italic>and</italic> knowing how to use and build on that knowledge&#8212;something we could metaphorically call a <italic>writerly</italic> stance toward climate science.</p>
