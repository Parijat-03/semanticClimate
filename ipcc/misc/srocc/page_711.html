National systems may be disjointed and piecemeal, and subject to cultural acceptance and competing political ideologies (Ni&#241;o-Zaraz&#250;a et al. 2012). For example, Liberia and Madagascar each have &#64257;ve different public works programmes, each with different donor organisations and different implementing agencies (Monchuk 2014).

Studies suggest that the adaptive capacity of communities has improved with regard to climate variability, like drought, when ex-ante tools, including insurance, have been employed holistically; providing insurance in combination with early warning and institutional and policy approaches reduces livelihood and food insecurity as well as strengthens social structures (Shiferaw et al. 2014; Lotze-Campen and Popp 2012). Bundling insurance with early warning and seasonal forecasting can reduce the cost of insurance premiums (Daron and Stainforth 2014). The regional risk insurance scheme, African Risk Capacity, has the potential to signi&#64257;cantly reduce the cost of insurance premiums (Siebert 2016) while bolstering contingency planning against food insecurity.</span></div><div left="65.19" right="313.24" top="255.58"><span style="x0: 65.19; x1: 72.76; y0: 255.58; y1: 265.08; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.19" y0="255.58" x1="313.24">Work-for-insurance programmes applied in the context of social protection have been shown to improve livelihood and food security in Ethiopia (Berhane 2014; Mohmmed et al. 2018) and Pakistan. The R4 Rural Resilience Initiative in Ethiopia is a widely cited example of a programme that serves the most vulnerable and includes aspects of resource management, and access by the poor to &#64257;nancial services, including insurance and savings (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2018). Weather index insurance (such as index-based crop insurance) is being presented to low-income farmers and pastoralists in developing countries (e.g., Ethiopia, India, Kazakhstan, South Asia) to complement informal risk sharing, reducing the risk of lost revenue associated with variations in crop yield, and provide an alternative to classic insurance (Bogale 2015a; Conradt et al. 2015; Dercon et&#160;al. 2014; Greatrex et al. 2015; McIntosh et al. 2013).

In Europe, modelling suggests that insurance incentives, such as vouchers, would be less expensive than total incentivised damage reduction and may reduce residential &#64258;ood risk in Germany by 12%&#160;in 2016 and 24% by 2040 (Hudson et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="563.21" top="615.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.92; y0: 615.42; y1: 625.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="615.42" x1="563.21">7.4.3 Policies responding to climate-related extremes</span></div><div left="323.72" right="478.37" top="591.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 591.42; y1: 601.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="591.42" x1="478.37">7.4.3.1 Risk management instruments</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="567.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.65; y0: 567.52; y1: 577.02; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="567.52" x1="571.76">Risk management addressing climate change has broadened to include mitigation, adaptation and disaster preparedness in a&#160;process using instruments facilitating contingency and cross-sectoral planning (Hurlimann and March 2012; Oels 2013), social community planning, and strategic, long-term planning (Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015a). A comprehensive consideration integrates principles from informal support mechanisms to enhance formal social protection programming (Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013; Stavropoulou et al. 2017) such that the social safety net, disaster risk management, and climate change adaptation are all considered to enhance livelihoods of the chronic poor (see char dwellers and recurrent &#64258;oods in Jamuna and Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh Awal 2013) (Section&#160;7.4.7).

In other words, practitioners utilise a consistent and operational conceptualisation of adaptation; focus on comparable units of analysis; develop comprehensive datasets on adaptation action; and are coherent with an understanding of what constitutes real adaptation (Ford and Berrang-Ford 2016).
