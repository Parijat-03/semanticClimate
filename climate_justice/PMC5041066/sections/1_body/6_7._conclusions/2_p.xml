The key is to view both the methodological and the theoretical approaches as useful. This framework can help to circumnavigate the limitations of causality outlined above, but it cannot replace the standard definition of effectiveness. Instead, combined approaches, such as applying epidemiological methods to analyze indicator relationships within the domains, will likely increase applicability of the model.</p>
