In the case of climate justice, relatively privileged communities are able to collectively seek government or otherwise institutionally-backed support, such as protective infrastructure projects, to reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate impacts (Agyeman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Schlosberg &amp; Collins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2014</xref>). Adaptation infrastructure projects, from sea walls and stormwater storage basins to green roofs and urban parks, can make a difference in reducing vulnerability to climate impacts.</p>
