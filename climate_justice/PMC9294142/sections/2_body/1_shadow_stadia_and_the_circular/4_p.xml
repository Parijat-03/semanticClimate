<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The urban construction sector is among the most evident sectors that contribute to negative environmental impacts (Kucukvar and Tatari, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Onat et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and research has shown that CE concepts such as the adaptive repurposing of existing, abandoned, and historical buildings, is beneficial for the environment and neighborhood revitalization (Bullen and Love, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Baker et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Foster, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Drawing from concepts such as adaptive reuse and maintenance architecture, Wergeland and Hognestad (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) concluded football (soccer) stadia have potential for circularity if the broader sports community becomes more willing to preserve architectural legacy. To do so, they argued further investment in stadium restoration is required to limit demolition of historic stadia, while legislative changes are necessary to make it easier to modify existing sports venues.</p>
