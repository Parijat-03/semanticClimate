<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0480">The CBD process offers the opportunity for a bolder and more integrated environmental agenda. The first draft document of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework emphasizes the need to protect biodiversity, halting and reversing extinction rates, and lists 21 targets for 2030, which combine efforts to reduce threats to biodiversity with meeting people needs and are underpinned by targets for tools to facilitate implementation (see CBD 2021). The targets include a focus on &#8220;integrated biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning&#8221; (CBD 2021, target 14). Integrating food production and biodiversity conservation targets in integrated spatial planning could resolve trade-offs between these two objectives and bring about net benefits for Nature and people (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fastr&#233; et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, the ambition of protecting 30% of terrestrial and marine areas by 2030 under discussion for the post-2020 Biodiversity Framework under the CBD needs to be strongly coupled with spatial planning for other land- and sea-uses (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fastr&#233; et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, the pandemic should be a reminder of the precautionary principle, motivating us to protect more rather than less to ensure that the web of life and ecosystem goods and services are adequately safeguarded and that the risk of future pandemics through spillover events is reduced.</p>
