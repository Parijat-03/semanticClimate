Environmental, health, and socioeconomic characteristics of communities are linked to differential, and in some cases disproportionate, heat-related morbidity and mortality impacts [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
