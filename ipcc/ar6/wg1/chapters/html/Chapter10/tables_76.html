The seasonality of runoff and streamflow (the\nannual difference between the wettest and driest months of the year) is expected to increase with global warming (high confidence).\nAnnual runoff is very likely to decrease. Under middle or high-emissions scenarios, the likelihood of extreme droughts increases by\n200&#8211;300% in the Mediterranean. The paleoclimate record provides context for these future expected changes: climate change will shift\nsoil moisture outside the range of observed and reconstructed values spanning the last millennium (high confidence) (Sections 8.4.1.5\nand 8.4.1.6).</td>
