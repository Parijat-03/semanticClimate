I want to foreground Extension in discussions of transition, amplifying and extending calls from Extension professionals and scholar-practitioners for an expansive conception of Extension&#8217;s mission as new public funds come online for precisely these purposes (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>; Peters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2021</xref>). Extension has unique relevance for its embeddedness in communities, competence across diverse social and economic domains, its public mission, and its strengths in popular education, networking, and capacity building. This essay is intended as a provocation to creatively think about what might be possible through Extension in this critical moment. This potential exists in embryonic form in Extension programs and practices that embrace a liberatory ethos, what I call Liberation Extension, a persistent but often underappreciated current of Extension work, particularly in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities. These deserve thoughtful consideration as a basis for reappraising Extension's mission.</p>
