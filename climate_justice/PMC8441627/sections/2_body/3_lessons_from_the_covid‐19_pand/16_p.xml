<p>Jung said, &#8216;We are beset by an all&#8208;to&#8208;human fear that consciousness &#8211; our Promethean conquest &#8211; may in the end not be able to serve us as well as nature&#8217; (Jung&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1926</xref>, para. 750). The Greek Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods for humans to use for progress and civilization: he was tortured into eternity for this. The punishment for consciousness that began with Adam and Eve in the originating Garden culminated in ecocide in the Book of Revelation. Jung also said, &#8216;Nature <italic toggle="yes">must not</italic> win the game, but she <italic toggle="yes">cannot</italic> lose&#8217; (Jung&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">1942</xref>, para. 229). Hopefully, with the help of vaccines, our social and economic systems will survive this round in the game with nature.</p>
