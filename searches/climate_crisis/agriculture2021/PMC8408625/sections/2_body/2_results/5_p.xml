<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0150">Mean winter temperature has a quadratic relationship with WNV. Temperatures of between 2&#160;&#176;C and 6&#160;&#176;C have a positive association with WNV infections, whereas colder and warmer temperatures outside of this range are negatively associated with WNV infections. The number of rain days per summer is also a strong predictor of WNV infections and has a linear positive relationship. Higher surface water in the summer is negatively correlated with WNV infections. The relationship is fairly strong considering its complexity i.e., the variable complexity has been reduced to standard deviation scores to standardize it across regions and seasons.</p>
