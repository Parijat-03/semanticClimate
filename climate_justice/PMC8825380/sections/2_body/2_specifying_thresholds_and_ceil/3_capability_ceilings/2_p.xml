The concept of ceilings, understood as limits to other&#8217;s actions, is somewhat similar to other principles such as John Stuart Mill&#8217;s &#8216;harm principle&#8217;, which justifies governmental restrictions on the freedom and actions of individuals to prevent harm to others (Mill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1956</xref>; Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 145). Thus, the CA is compatible with at least some liberal principles of justice.</p>
