<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We acknowledge the literature on turbine location as an issue of climate justice and environmental racism. Climate justice has several dimensions, and an important one pertains to the asymmetrical distribution in the gains from decarbonization [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Typical examples include subsidies for electric cars or rooftop solar, which tend to flow to richer households. The inability of Native Nations to convert wind energy potential into a tangible economic resource raises questions as to why these nations are not benefiting from the broader thrust of decarbonizing electricity generation, which to some extent benefits from governmental subsidies. We recognize that wind turbines might be welcomed in all communities. Indeed, several municipalities and counties have enacted laws to discourage the installation of wind energy turbines [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Tribal nations, as sovereign governments, might decide that wind turbines are not a good fit for their lands and citizens. Eventually, the decision about building wind turbines must be grounded in local knowledge of needs and circumstances. Nevertheless, as countries and companies adopt net zero-emission targets, demand for wind energy will increase. This does provide an important economic opportunity for tribal nations to leverage their wind energy potential into a tangible economic resource.</p>
