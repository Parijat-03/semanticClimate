In April 2015, the PBoC and the UNEP Inquiry released their final report on &#8216;Establishing China&#8217;s Green Financial System&#8217; (PBoC/UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>). The report made recommendations on specialised investment institutions, fiscal and financial policy support, financial infrastructure and legal infrastructure (Ibid, 3). In September 2015 the CCP Central Committee and State Council proposed the &#8216;construction of a green financial system&#8217; in their &#8216;Overall Plan for the Reform of the Ecological Civilization System&#8217;. In August 2016, the State Council released the &#8216;Guidelines for Establishing a Green Financial System&#8217; (PBoC et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2016</xref>). The Guidelines adopt most of the PBoC/UNEP recommendations.</p>
