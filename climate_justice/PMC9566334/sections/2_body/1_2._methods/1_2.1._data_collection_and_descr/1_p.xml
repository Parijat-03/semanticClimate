<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Demographic and SUHI intensity data were collected from the top 200 most populous cities in the US defined by the US Decadal 2020 Census [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There is some overlap between variables since &#8220;Black&#8221; includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black persons. &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; also includes Black Hispanics. At the time of collection, data were not available on Black Hispanics so it was not possible to account for them specifically. The counts for the total population and populations of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian persons were retrieved for the respective census tracts of each city. These counts were also used to create a percentage of each population group for each census tract. There were a total of 44,622 census tracts selected at this stage.</p>
