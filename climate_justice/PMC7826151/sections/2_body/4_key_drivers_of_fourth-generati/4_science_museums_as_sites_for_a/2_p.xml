<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par40">We know that, historically, science museums have excluded marginalized, disenfranchised, and disempowered populations (see Dawson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">b</xref>; Feinstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). For many, these institutions can be seen as alienating and inaccessible places where whiteness (and the status quo) is often privileged. These reflections cause us to question how science museums can decolonize themselves and establish relationships with the communities in which they are immersed. Potential pathways for enacting social inclusion and equity in meaningful ways include establishing partnerships and networks with different organizations and social actors such as universities, community centres, local environmental initiatives, and schools. This implies consultation with communities, building cultural competencies, and fostering community participation and acceptance (Dawson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">b</xref>; Feinstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>; Janes &amp; Sandell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). Clearly, we are beginning to see the emergence of equity frameworks for science museums based on infrastructure access, literacy, community acceptance (Dawson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">b</xref>), and creative practices that support cross-cultural learning opportunities (Aguirre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>). Similarly, we advocate building experiences and practices that are inclusive, relevant, and meaningful for all visitors.</p>
