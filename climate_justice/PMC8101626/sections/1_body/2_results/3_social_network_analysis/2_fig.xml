Larger font size of the label corresponds to an increase in nodes (number of times that username was mentioned in a retweet). B, User network diagram of 2 active Infectious Diseases Twitter users (@CarlosdelRio7, @GermHunterMD). Nodes (circles in gray) are labeled with the user account handle, and edges (pink lines connecting circles) represent interaction between those users. Darker lines represent increased interaction, and depicted are 5 large clusters of activity. Note, 3 other nodes (@alvie_bar, @nynursesunited, @universalmaski2) emerge as active participants of the network. C, Subjectivity analysis of the top 20 users with a minimum of 5 IDWeek 2020 tweets based on follower network. A subjectivity score of 0 represents complete objectivity, while a score of 1 represents complete subjectivity. Whiskers represent interquartile range, and diamonds represent outlier values.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ofaa621_fig1a"/><graphic xlink:href="ofaa621_fig1b"/></fig>
