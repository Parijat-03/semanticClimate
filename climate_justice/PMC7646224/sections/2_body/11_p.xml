Death rates were three times higher (Saloner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). It&#8217;s also likely that these numbers underestimate the prevalence of coronavirus in prisons, since some aren&#8217;t testing or reporting cases at all (Van Beusekom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Similarly, immigrants detained in ICE detention facilitates have faced disproportionate exposure to coronavirus and systemic lack of access to basic measures of protection.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref> The disregard that the US government has shown toward the humanity and health of people in prisons, jails, and ICE custody is a human rights atrocity that will stain the country&#8217;s history for generations to come.</p>
