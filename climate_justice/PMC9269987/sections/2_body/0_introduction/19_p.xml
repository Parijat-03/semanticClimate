Albeit the fact that pro-environmental intention cannot be regarded as a promising predictor for (future) pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Sheeran, 2002</xref>), past pro-environmental behavior was found to be a strong predictor for pro-environmental intentions (e.g., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bamberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Carrus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Manca et al., 2020</xref>). As pro-environmental behavior was assessed retrospectively (as &#8220;past pro-environmental behavior&#8221;) in Study 1, we also checked if this finding can be replicated with our data (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
