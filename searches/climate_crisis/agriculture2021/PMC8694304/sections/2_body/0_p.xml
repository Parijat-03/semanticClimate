Across the world, more than five million lives have been lost and millions more have been upended.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Children have missed months of vital schooling; rates of child marriage, domestic violence, and social isolation have increased; and many individuals have been unable to work, visit others, and grieve. The pandemic has also revealed the shortcomings and short-sightedness embedded in the relationships of most human societies with the nonhuman world, whether due to our failure to combat zoonoses, our reckless overuse of antibiotics, or the chronic vulnerability of our food systems. Yet, as governments apportion trillions of dollars to post-COVID-19 recovery, we await a true reckoning&#8212;including another pandemic. For COVID-19 is &#8220;not necessarily the big one,&#8221; according to Michael Ryan, head of emergencies at the World Health Organization.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
