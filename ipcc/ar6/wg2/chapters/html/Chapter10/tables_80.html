However, this recognition requires more practical application and translation into IKLK-driven EbA projects.\nFor instance, in the Coral Triangle region, creating historical timelines and mapping seasonal calendars can help to\ncapture IKLK while also feeding this information into climate science and climate adaptation planning. Identifying\nindigenous crop species for agriculture by using IKLK is already identified as an important way to localise climate\nadaptation: an example is Bali&#8217;s vital contribution of moral economies to food systems which have long built\nresilience among groups of communities in terms of food security and sovereignty, even with the challenges faced</td>

However, such transformational change is deeply challenging because of variable national development\nimperatives; differing capacities and requirements of large, highly unequal and vulnerable populations; and\nsocioeconomic and ecological diversity that requires very contextual solutions. Furthermore, issues such as growing\ntransboundary risks, inadequate data for long-term adaptation planning, finance barriers, uneven institutional\ncapacity and non-climatic issues, such as increasing conflict, political instability and polarization, constrain rapid,\ntransformational action across systems.</td>
