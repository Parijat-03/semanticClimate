The average surface temperature of the planet is now approximately 1.2&#176;C higher than in pre&#8208;industrial times, and the associated health impacts are evident [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, individuals with concomitant conditions, the elderly and people living in low&#8208;income settings are disproportionately affected [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Governments, civil society and all sectors are grappling with the need to rapidly decarbonise to prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5&#176;C and to prevent the worst effects of climate change as agreed in the Paris Climate Accord [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
