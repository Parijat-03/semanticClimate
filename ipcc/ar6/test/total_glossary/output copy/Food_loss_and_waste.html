<p>Food waste is part of food loss and refers to discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from primary production to end household consumer level. Food waste is recognised as a distinct part of food loss because the drivers that generate it and the solutions to it are different from those of food losses (FAO, 2015).</p>
