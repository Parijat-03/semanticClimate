The UK can only be credible as the presidency of COP26 if they are implementing the actions they are calling for in their own policies &#8211; low carbon development, carbon neutrality and ambitious climate action. The UK currently has no coherence across departments &#8211; UK Export Finance still supports fossil fuel investment in developing countries and negotiations for post&#8208;Brexit trade deals do not prioritise environmental integrity. A government&#8208;wide pursuit of a green recovery could realign poor existing policies.</p>
