(and Canada too), with the murder of George Floyd and the tragic loss of Regis Korchinski-Paquet. These events transpired as we wrote this paper, and we carry them with us. Systemic racism is deeply embedded within our culture, institutions societies, and practices. The sorrow, pain, and outrage felt throughout the world has mobilized a series of protests and actions denouncing recent events and calling for justice and change. At no other time has it been more apparent to us that science museums must also serve as hubs of change and transformation. Institutions must move from their inward gaze to an outward one, from looking to the past to also looking to the present and future.</p>
