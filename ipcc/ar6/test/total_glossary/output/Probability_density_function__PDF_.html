<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">probability density function</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><div><p class="definition" style="font-weight: bold">A probability density function is a function that indicates the relative chances of occurrence of different outcomes of a variable.</p><p>The function integrates to unity over the domain for which it is defined and has the property that the integral over a sub-domain equals the probability that the outcome of the variable lies within that sub-domain. For example, the probability that a temperature anomaly defined in a particular way is greater than zero is obtained from its PDF by integrating the PDF over all possible temperature anomalies greater than zero. Probability density functions that describe two or more variables simultaneously are similarly defined.</p></div></dd><div>
