Lessons last 45 min each and are broadcast via the PCS YouTube channel. The lessons are suitable for different grades and are delivered by teams of students with activist backgrounds and subject experts, including university teachers and researchers, from different institutions with expertise in the focus area of the respective lesson. The lessons, which emphasise the importance of critical thinking, provide basic knowledge about the climate crisis and its impact in different social and scientific fields (e.g., economics, politics). </p>
