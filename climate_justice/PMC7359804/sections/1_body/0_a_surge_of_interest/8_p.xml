<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">The boundary between state- and society-centric research is fluid and work on either side is proliferating. It nonetheless appears that the growth in interest among both transport geographers and mobilities scholars is particularly stark in society-centric research. This is why the articles brought together in this Virtual Special Issue (VSI) tend to be society-centric. At the same time, if we are to fully appreciate theoretical diversification in research on transport/mobility justice, we also need to consider developments in state-centric research. Below we summarise the diversification in theorisation in three parts, before discussing how the contributions in the VSI speak to the three other tendencies as well.</p>
