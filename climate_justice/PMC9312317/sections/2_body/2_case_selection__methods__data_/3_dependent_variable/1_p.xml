Correspondingly, to tap into views on mitigation and adaptation, we asked respondents whether they thought the government action they were demanding should prioritize mitigation, adaptation or treat both equally. Specifically, they were asked:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par29"><italic>If forced to prioritize the allocation of limited resources, what do you think the government in your country should do?</italic><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par30"><italic>The government should prioritize measures to reduce climate change, such as lowering CO2 emissions.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31"><italic>The government should prioritize protecting people against the impacts of climate change, such as flooding, drought and forest fires.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32"><italic>The government should give equal priority to both.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33"><italic>Don&#8217;t know, no opinion.</italic></p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p>
