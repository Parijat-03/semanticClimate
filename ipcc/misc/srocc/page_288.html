Accordingly, the available micro-level evidence suggests that climate-related shocks are one of the many drivers of migration (Adger et al. 2014; London Government Of&#64257;ce for Science and Foresight 2011; Melde et al. 2017), but the individual responses to climate risk are more complex than commonly assumed (Gray and Mueller 2012a). For example, despite strong focus on natural disasters, neither &#64258;ooding (Gray&#160;and&#160;Mueller 2012b; Mueller et al. 2014) nor earthquakes (Halliday 2006) were found to induce long-term migration; but instead, slow-onset changes, especially those provoking crop failures and heat stress, could affect household or individual migration decisions (Gray and Mueller 2012a; Missirian and Schlenker 2017; Mueller et al. 2014). Out-migration from drought-prone areas has received particular attention (de Sherbinin et al. 2012; Ezra and Kiros 2001). A&#160;substantial body of literature suggests that households engage in local or internal migration as a&#160;response to drought (Findlay 2011; Gray and Mueller 2012a), while international migration decreases with drought in some contexts (Henry et al. 2004), but might increase in contexts where migration networks are well established (Feng et al. 2010; Nawrotzki and DeWaard 2016; Nawrotzki et al. 2015, 2016). Similarly, the evidence is not conclusive with respect to the effect of environmental drivers, in particular deserti&#64257;cation, on mobility. While it has not consistently entailed out-migration in the case of Ecuadorian Andes (Gray 2009, 2010), environmental and land degradation increased mobility in Kenya and Nepal (Gray&#160;2011; Massey et al. 2010), but marginally decreased mobility in Uganda (Gray 2011). These results suggest that in some contexts, environmental shocks actually undermine households&#8217; &#64257;nancial capacity to undertake migration (Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava 2017), especially in the case of the poorest households (Barbier and Hochard 2018; Koubi et al. 2016; Kubik and Maurel 2016; McKenzie and Yang 2015). Adding to the complexity, migration, especially to frontier areas, by increasing pressure on land and natural resources, might itself contribute to environmental degradation at the destination (Hugo 2008; IPBES 2018a; McLeman 2017). The consequences of migration can also be salient in the case of migration to urban or peri-urban areas; indeed, environmentally induced migration can add to urbanisation (Section&#160;3.6.2.2), often exacerbating problems related to poor infrastructure and&#160;unemployment. </span></div><div left="59.24" right="226.86" top="195.42"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.04; y0: 195.42; y1: 205.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="195.42" x1="226.86">1.4.2.10 Impacts on pastoral communities </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.28" top="171.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.81; y0: 171.52; y1: 181.02; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="171.52" x1="307.28">Pastoral production systems occupy a&#160;signi&#64257;cant portion of the world (Rass 2006; Dong 2016).

The Sahelian droughts of the 1970s&#8211;1980s provided an example of how droughts could affect livestock resources and crop productivity, contributing to hunger, out-migration and suffering for millions of pastoralists (Hein and De&#160;Ridder 2006; Molua and Lambi 2007). During these Sahelian droughts low and erratic rainfall exacerbated deserti&#64257;cation processes, leading to ecological changes that forced people to use marginal lands and ecosystems.

On the other hand, misguided policies such as enforced sedentarisation, and in certain cases protected area delineation (fencing), which restrict livestock mobility have hampered optimal use of grazing land resources (Du 2012). Such policies have led to degradation of resources and out-migration of people in search of better livelihoods (Gebeye 2016; Liao et al. 2015). Restrictions on the mobile lifestyle are reducing the resilient adaptive capacity of pastoralists to natural hazards including extreme and variable weather conditions, drought and climate change (Schilling et al. 2014). Furthermore, the exacerbation of the deserti&#64257;cation phenomenon due to agricultural intensi&#64257;cation (D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2013) and land fragmentation caused by encroachment of agriculture into rangelands (Otuoma et al. 2009; Behnke and Kerven 2013) is threatening pastoral livelihoods.

Food shortages and the urgency to produce enough crop for public consumption are leading to the encroachment of agriculture into productive rangelands and those converted rangelands are frequently prime lands used by pastoralists to produce feed and graze their livestock during dry years (Dodd 1994). The sustainability of pastoral systems is therefore coming into question because of social and political marginalisation of those systems (Davies et al. 2016) and also because of the &#64257;erce competition they are facing from other livelihood sources such as crop farming (Haan et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="449.03" top="279.01"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 324.0; y0: 279.01; y1: 291.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.76" y0="279.01" x1="449.03">1.5 Future projections</span></div><div left="317.76" right="511.03" top="255.42"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.96; y0: 255.42; y1: 265.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.76" y0="255.42" x1="511.03">1.5.1 Future projections of deserti&#64257;cation </span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="231.52"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 323.22; y0: 231.52; y1: 241.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="231.52" x1="565.81">Assessing the impact of climate change on future deserti&#64257;cation is dif&#64257;cult as several environmental and anthropogenic variables interact to determine its dynamics.
