The positive phase of the AMV is characterized by anomalous warming over the entire North Atlantic, with the strongest amplitude in the subpolar gyre and along sea-ice margin zones in the Labrador Sea and Greenland/Barents Sea and in the subtropical North Atlantic basin to a lower extent. In the AR6 WGI report, the term AMV is preferred to Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) used in previous IPCC reports because there is no preferred time scale of decadal variability as the term oscillation would indirectly imply. See Section AIV.2.7 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></div></dd><div>
