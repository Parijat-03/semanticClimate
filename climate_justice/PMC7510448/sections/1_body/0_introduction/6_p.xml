<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">What falls under the global poor is subject to many debates. Our understanding of the poor follows the UN definition of poverty as &#8220;a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information&#8221; (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 1996</xref>, 38). Poverty depends not only on income but also on access to social services and is intertwined with social discrimination and exclusion. Most of the nearly 1 billion people that live below the international poverty line of US$ 1.90 a day live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sumner et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). While a pro-poor focus within planetary stewardship and planetary justice is relevant for the poor in all countries, it is particularly pertinent, we argue, for countries in the Global South that are home to the so-called &#8220;bottom billion&#8221; (Collier, 2007; for a recent critique, see <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ravallion, 2020</xref>).</p>
