<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Kinetic energy from airflow arising from the uneven heating of the Earthâs surface. The windâs kinetic energy is converted to mechanical shaft energy and electricity by a wind turbine, a rotating machine. A wind farm, wind project, wind park, or wind power plant is a group of wind turbines interconnected to a common utility system through a system of transformers, distribution lines, and (usually) one substation.</p></dd>
