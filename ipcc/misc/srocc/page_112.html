Conservation agriculture and forestry uses management practices with minimal soil disturbance such as no tillage or minimum tillage, permanent soil cover with mulch, combined with rotations to ensure a&#160;permanent soil surface, or rapid regeneration of forest following harvest (Hobbs et al.&#160;2008; Friedrich et al.&#160;2012). Vegetation and soils in forests and woodland ecosystems play a&#160;crucial role in regulating critical ecosystem processes, therefore reduced deforestation together with sustainable forest management are integral to SLM (FAO 2015b) (Section&#160;4.8). In some circumstances, increased demand for forest products can also lead to increased management of carbon storage in forests (Favero and Mendelsohn 2014). Precision agriculture is characterised by a&#160;&#8220;management system that is information and technology based, is site speci&#64257;c and uses one or more of the following sources of data: soils, crops, nutrients, pests, moisture, or yield, for optimum pro&#64257;tability, sustainability, and protection of the environment&#8221; (USDA 2007) (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5).

Enhancing the carbon content of soil and/or use of biochar (Chapter&#160;4) have become increasingly important as a&#160;climate change mitigation option with possibly large co-bene&#64257;ts for other ecosystem services. Enhancing soil carbon storage and the addition of biochar can be practiced with limited competition for land, provided no productivity/yield loss and abundant unused biomass, but evidence is limited and impacts of large scale application of biochar on the full GHG balance of soils, or human health are yet to be explored (Gurwick et al.&#160;2013; Lorenz and Lal 2014; Smith 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="462.89" top="339.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 339.42; y1: 349.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="339.42" x1="462.89">1.3.3 Value chain management</span></div><div left="318.05" right="435.3" top="315.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 315.42; y1: 325.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="315.42" x1="435.3">1.3.3.1 Supply management</span></div><div left="318.05" right="465.45" top="291.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.45; y0: 291.52; y1: 301.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="291.52" x1="465.45">Food losses from harvest to retailer. </span><span style="x0: 465.85; x1: 471.3; y0: 291.52; y1: 301.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="465.85" y0="291.52" x1="566.11">Approximately one-third of losses and waste in the food system occurs between crop production and food consumption, increasing substantially if losses in livestock production and overeating are included (Gustavsson et al.&#160;2011; Alexander et al.&#160;2017).

For instance, averaged for eastern and southern Africa an estimated 10&#8211;17% of annual grain production is lost (Zorya et al.&#160;2011). Across 84 countries and different time periods, annual median losses in the supply chain before retailing were estimated at about 28 kg per capita for cereals or about 12 kg per capita for eggs and dairy products (Xue et al.&#160;2017).

Potential adverse side-effects of forest area expansion depend largely on the state of the land it displaces as well as tree species selections. Active governance and planning contribute to maximising co-bene&#64257;ts while minimising adverse side-effects (Laestadius et al.&#160;2011; Dinerstein et al.&#160;2015; Veldman et al.&#160;2017) (Section&#160;4.8 and Chapter&#160;7).
