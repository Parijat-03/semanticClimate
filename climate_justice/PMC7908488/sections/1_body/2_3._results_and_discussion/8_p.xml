<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Since low-income and Latinx neighborhoods in many parts of the Southwest have little green space, high amounts of impervious surfaces, and higher urban density (e.g., [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it seems likely that these factors explain much about thermal disparities. Satellite imagery could verify this assumption, and further research could develop such an analysis. The implication would be that programs to increase vegetation within disadvantaged neighborhoods and reduce or lighten pavements and rooftops could help reduce thermal disparities between neighborhoods of different socioeconomic characteristics.</p>
