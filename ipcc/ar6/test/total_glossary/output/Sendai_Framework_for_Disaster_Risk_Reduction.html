<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015â2030 outlines seven clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new, and to reduce existing, disaster risks. The voluntary, non-binding agreement recognises that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders, including local government and the private sector. Its aim is to achieve âsubstantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countriesâ.</p></dd>
