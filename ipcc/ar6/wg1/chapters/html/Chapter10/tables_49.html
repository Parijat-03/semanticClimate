      <td>Bias adjustment is an approach to post-process climate model output and has become widely used in climate hazard and impact studies\n(Gangopadhyay et al., 2011; Hagemann et al., 2013; Warszawski et al., 2014) and national assessment reports (Cayan et al., 2013;\nGeorgakakos et al., 2014). Despite its wide use, bias adjustment was not assessed in AR5 (Flato et al., 2014). Several problems have been\nidentified that may arise from an uncritical use of bias adjustment, and that may result in misleading impact assessments. The rationale of\nthis Cross-Chapter Box is to provide an overview of the use of bias adjustment in this Report, and to assess key limitations of the approach.</td>

      <td>Bias-adjusted climate model output is used extensively throughout this Report. Several results from Chapter 8, and many of the\nclimatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Section 12.2) are based on bias adjustment. The Atlas presents many results both as raw and\nbias-adjusted data (Atlas.1.4.5). The application of bias adjustment in the WGI report was informed by the assessment in Chapter 10\nand this Cross-Chapter Box. Finally, bias adjustment is crucial for many studies assessed in the WGII report. An overview of bias\nadjustment can be found in Section 10.3.1.3, a general performance assessment of individual method classes in Section 10.3.3.7.\nThe fitness of bias adjustment for climate change applications is assessed in Section 10.3.3.9.</td>

Some argue that these trend modifications are implicit corrections of\nstate-dependent biases (Boberg and Christensen, 2012; Gobiet et al., 2015). However, others argue that the modification is generally\ninvalid because the modification is linked to the representation of day-to-day rather than long-term variability (Pierce et al., 2015;\nMaraun et al., 2017); a given temperature value does not necessarily belong to the same weather state in present and future climate\n(Maraun et al., 2017); the modification affects the models climate sensitivity (Hempel et al., 2013); and is affected by random internal\nclimate variability (Switanek et al., 2017). Thus, trend preserving quantile mapping methods have been developed (Section 10.3.1.3.2),\nalthough some authors found no clear advantage of these methods (Maurer and Pierce, 2014). Further research is required to fully\nunderstand the validity of trend modifications by quantile-mapping.</td>

      <td>As bias adjustment in general does not account for circulation errors, it is therefore important to understand the impact of these errors on the\noutcome of the bias adjustment (Addor et al., 2016; Photiadou et al., 2016; Maraun et al., 2017). If the frequency of precipitation-relevant\nweather types is biased, a standard bias adjustment (not accounting for this frequency bias) would remove the overall climatological bias,\nbut the precipitation falling in a given weather type could still be substantially biased (Addor et al., 2016). Adjusting the number of wet\ndays can artificially deteriorate the spell-length distribution (Maraun et al., 2017). In the presence of location biases of circulation patterns,\nbias adjustment may introduce physically implausible solutions (Maraun et al., 2017). Bias adjusting the location of circulation features\n(Levy et al., 2013) may introduce inconsistencies with the model orography, land&#8211;sea contrasts, and SSTs (Maraun et al., 2017).</td>
