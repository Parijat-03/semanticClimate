<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Considering the impacts of climate change, we must ensure that health risks are fully integrated into the economic cost should companies seek to avoid liability for climate risks. Should this recommendation be adopted, we are confident we will see further developments in the field of litigation where public health arguments play a key role in mobilizing legislative action. As the risk of harm to public health is integrated into the economy, through legal liability, this can incentivize a well-being/health-based economy. This will be a win for not only the plaintiffs pursuing litigation, but also for the whole of humanity whose health and future survival is under dire threat by the climate crisis.</p>
