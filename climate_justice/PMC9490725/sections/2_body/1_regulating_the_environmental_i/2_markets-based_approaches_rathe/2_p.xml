According to Green (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>: 449), the IPCC report on &#8220;National and Sub-national Policies and Institutions&#8221; did not contain even one mention of bans.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Le Billon &amp; Kristoffersen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>) point out that it would be simpler to cut supply because there are far fewer suppliers than consumers, although they recognise several challenges with this approach such as the importance of fossil fuel production to many countries&#8217; sovereign revenue or tax income, possibility for leakage between countries and the policy focus on consumption rather than production.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref></p>
