Prior to the pandemic, these &#8216;virtual appointments&#8217; used interview rooms designed to enable technology-based service delivery. Students take instructions and then confer with their supervisor, while the client stays near their computer. Once supervisor and student agree on the steps to be recommended to the client, the student returns to the interview room and conveys that advice.</p>
