For instance, culture has been shown to be a&#160;major barrier to adaptation for the Fulbe ethnic group of Burkina Faso (Nielsen and Reenberg 2010). Thus, it is important to understand how beliefs, values, practices and habits interact with the behaviour of individuals and collectivities that have to confront climate change (Heyd and Thomas 2008). Granderson (2014) suggests that making sense of climate change and its responses at the community level demands attention to the cultural and political processes that shape how risk is conceived, prioritised and managed.

Murphy et al. (2016) stated that culture and beliefs play an important role in adaptive capacity but that they are not static. In the work done by Elum et al. (2017) in South Africa (about farmers&#8217; perception of climate change), they concluded that perceptions and beliefs often have negative effects on adaptation options.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="471.14"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 471.14; y1: 480.64; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="471.14" x1="307.58">Culture is a&#160;key issue in food systems and the relation of people with nature. Food is an intrinsically cultural process: food production shapes landscapes, which in turn are linked to cultural heritages and identities (Koohafkan and Altieri 2011; Fuller and Qingwen 2013), and food consumption has a&#160;strong cultural dimension. The loss of subsistence practices in modern cultures and their related ILK, has resulted in a&#160;loss of valuable adaptive capacities (Hern&#225;ndez-Morcillo et al. 2014). This is so because these systems are often characterised by livelihood strategies linked to the management of natural resources that have been evolved to reduce overall vulnerability to climate shocks&#160;(&#8216;adaptive strategies&#8217;) and to manage their impacts ex-post&#160;(&#8216;coping strategies&#8217;) (Morton 2007; L&#243;pez-i-Gelats et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="196.11" top="302.98"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 302.98; y1: 312.98; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="302.98" x1="196.11">1.3.3 Supply-side adaptation</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="279.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 279.11; y1: 288.61; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="279.11" x1="307.58">Supply-side adaptation takes place in the production (of crops, livestock, and aquaculture), storage, transport, processing, and trade of food. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="160.51" top="230.98"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 230.98; y1: 240.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="230.98" x1="160.51">1.3.3.1 Crop production</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="207.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 207.11; y1: 216.61; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="207.11" x1="307.55">There are many current agricultural management practices that can be optimised and scaled up to advance adaptation. Among the often-studied adaptation options are increased soil organic matter, improved cropland management, increased food productivity, prevention and reversal of soil erosion (see Chapter&#160;6&#160;for evaluation of these practices in regard to desertification and land degradation). Many analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of soil management and changing sowing date, crop type or variety (Waongo et al. 2015; Bodin et al. 2016; Teixeira et al. 2017; Waha et al. 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2017; Chalise and Naranpanawa 2016; Moniruzzaman 2015; Sanz et al. 2017).

Cover cropping and no-tillage also improved soil health in a&#160;highly commercialised arid irrigated system in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley, USA (Mitchell et al. 2017). Biofertilisers can enhance rice yields (Kantachote et al. 2016), and Amanullah and Khalid (2016) found that manure and biofertiliser improve maize productivity under semi-arid conditions.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="579.14"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 579.14; y1: 588.64; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="579.14" x1="566.12">Adaptation also involves use of current genetic resources as well as breeding programmes for both crops and livestock. More drought, flood and heat-resistant crop varieties (Atlin et al. 2017; Mickelbart et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2017) and improved nutrient and water use efficiency, including overabundance as well as water quality (such as salinity) (Bond et al. 2018) are aspects to factor into the design of adaptation measures. Both availability and adoption of these varieties is a&#160;possible path for adaptation and can be facilitated by new outreach policy and capacity building. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="459.16"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.61; y0: 459.16; y1: 468.66; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="459.16" x1="566.12">Water management is another key area for adaptation. Increasing water availability and reliability of water for agricultural production using different techniques of water harvesting, storage, and its judicious utilisation through farm ponds, dams, and community tanks in rainfed agriculture areas have been presented by Rao et al. (2017) and Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016a). In addition, improved drainage systems (Thiel et al. 2015), and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) techniques for rice cultivation (Howell et al. 2015; Rahman and Bulbul 2015) have been proposed. Efficient irrigation systems have been also analysed and proposed by J&#228;germeyr et al. (2016), Naresh et al. (2017), Gunarathna et al. (2017) and Chartzoulakis and Bertaki (2015). Recent innovation includes using farming systems with low usage of water such as drip-irrigation or hydroponic systems mostly in urban farming.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="468.06" top="278.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 278.98; y1: 288.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="278.98" x1="468.06">1.3.3.2 Livestock production systems</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="255.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 255.11; y1: 264.61; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="255.11" x1="566.1">Considering the benefits of higher temperature in temperate climates and the increase of pasture with incremental warming in some humid and temperate grasslands, as well as potential negative effects, can be useful in planning adaptation strategies to future climate change. Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016b) characterize adaptation for different livestock systems as managerial, technical, behavioural and policy-related options. Managerial included production adjustments (e.g.,&#160;intensification, integration with crops, shifting from grazing to browsing species, multispecies herds, mobility, soil and nutrient management, water management, pasture management, corralling, feed and food storage, farm diversification or cooling systems); and changes in labour allocation (diversifying livelihoods, shifting to irrigated farming, and labour flexibility). Technological options included breeding strategies and information technology research. Behavioural options are linked to cultural patterns and included encouraging social collaboration and reciprocity, for example, </span></div></body></html>
