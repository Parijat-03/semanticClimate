<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Drawing on the social identity model of collective action (SIMCA) by <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al. (2008)</xref>, we describe several extensions developed in the context of privilege engagement, or specifically, engagement for the climate justice movement. The SIMCA model represents an integrative approach that attempts to link three theoretical perspectives in the psychology of collective action: Instrumental theories (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Olson, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">McCarthy and Zald, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bamberg et al., 2015</xref>) are integrated together with emotion-based approaches (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Ortiz, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Iyer and Leach, 2009</xref>) and the social identity approach (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Simon and Klandermans, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Drury and Reicher, 2009</xref>) with the aim of describing predictors for participation in collective action. This means that this approach takes into account the extent to which particular actions are instrumental for the persons involved, that is, are means to achieve certain ends. At the same time, it takes into account that certain feelings and sensations guide the actions of the persons involved. Finally, a particular social identity in the sense of belonging to a certain social group plays a role in this context.</p>
