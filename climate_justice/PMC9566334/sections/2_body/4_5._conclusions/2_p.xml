The percentage of the Black population in a census tract is the strongest indicator of increased SUHI intensity of the examined variables. A standard deviation increase in the Black population (23.44%) sees an increase in the average SUHI intensity of a census tract by 0.42 K. Conversely, larger portions of the White population are exposed to lower degrees of SUHI intensity (26.69% increase lowers intensity by 0.25 K). Hispanic and Asian population percentages, similar to Black percentages, align with tendencies toward increasing SUHI intensity. Future studies should look to separate these groups by socioeconomic status (these data were not yet available for the 2020 Census used in this study) to further account for the effect of higher/lower degrees thereof. Finally, this study could be used to identify the most inequitable cities and perform a more local-scale analysis using higher resolution satellite imagery and possibly a finer level of aggregation, such as census block group, for comparison. Such studies could also help determine if many of the trends uncovered in this examination are maintained at a smaller level of aggregation.</p>
