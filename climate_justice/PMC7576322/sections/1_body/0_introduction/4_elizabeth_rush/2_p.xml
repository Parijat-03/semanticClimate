<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0020">The central focus of the book is not based on the science behind climate change and sea level rise (though that science is present), but rather on how these scientific phenomena impact people that live in climate sensitive areas. Rush is currently a visiting lecturer in the English Department at Brown University, and has written articles appearing in <italic>The New York Times, Harpers, Orion, Le Monde Diplomatique</italic> and others (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Rush, 2020</xref>). In bringing to life the stories of people impacted by climate change, Rush utilizes creative non-fiction as her storytelling method, blending her narrative with those of whom she is interviewing, while aggregating it against the backdrop of impending sea level rise. In humanizing such a monumental, slow moving catastrophe, the reader feels the building pressure that sea level rise and increasing temperatures are bringing to communities, and how that pressure stretches the social fabric of what it means to be a citizen, and community member.</p>
