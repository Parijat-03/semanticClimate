Regional models necessarily inherit biases from the global models used to provide boundary conditions. Furthermore, the ability of AR5 to systematically evaluate regional climate models (RCMs), and statistical downscaling schemes, were hampered because coordinated intercomparison studies were still emerging. However, several studies demonstrated that added value arises from higher resolution in regions where stationary small-scale features like topography and complex coastlines are present, and from improved representation of small-scale processes like convective precipitation.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.11" top="402.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="402.6" x1="549.11" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 78.43; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">WGI Chapter&#160;14 (Christensen et&#160;al., 2013) stressed that credibility in regional climate change projections increases when key drivers of the change are known to be well-simulated and well-projected by climate models.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.09" top="366.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="366.6" x1="549.09" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 78.43; y0: 366.6; y1: 376.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Working Group II (WGII) Chapter&#160;21 (Hewitson et al., 2014b) addressed the regional climate change context from the perspective of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. This chapter emphasized that a&#160;good understanding of decision-making contexts is essential to define the type and scale of information required from physical climate. Further, the chapter identified that the regional climate information was limited by the paucity of comprehensive observations and their analysis along with the different levels of confidence in projections (</span><span style="x0: 125.68; x1: 130.26; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="125.68" y0="318.6" x1="183.36">high confidence</span><span x0="183.36" y0="318.6" x1="549.08" style="x0: 183.36; x1: 186.0; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). Notably, at the time of AR5, many studies still relied on global datasets, models, and assessment methods to inform regional decisions, which were not considered as effective as tailored regional approaches. The regional scale was not defined but instead it was emphasized that climate change responses play out on a&#160;range of scales, and the relevance and limitations of information differ strongly from global to local scales, and from one region to another.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.05" top="258.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="258.6" x1="549.05" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.97; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Chapter&#160;21 noted that the production of downscaled datasets (by both dynamical and statistical methods) remains weakly coordinated, and that results indicate that high-resolution downscaled reconstructions of the current climate can have significant errors. Key in this was that the increase in downscaled datasets has not narrowed the uncertainty range, and that integrating these data with historical change and process-based understanding remains an important challenge.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.06" top="198.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="198.6" x1="549.06" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 198.6; y1: 208.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The chapter identified the common perception that higher resolution (i.e., more spatial detail) equates to more usable and robust information, which is not necessarily true.

Perspectives were characterized as top-down (physical vulnerability) and bottom-up perspectives (social vulnerability). The top-down perspective uses climate change impacts as the starting point of how people and/or ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, and commonly applies global-scale scenario information or refines this to the region of interest through downscaling procedures. Conversely, in the &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; approach the development context is the starting point, focusing on local scales, and layers climate change on top of this. An impact focus tends to look to the future to see how to adjust to expected changes, whereas a&#160;vulnerability-focused approach is centred on addressing the drivers of current vulnerability.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="714.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="714.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 59.5; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">recent and current state of the climate from observations, most of which are key for the production of regional information.
