However, the effects were not nearly enough to change the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and it was also short lived. At the peak of the lockdown, in April 2020, emissions were down 17% globally from a year ago (Le Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). By early June, daily carbon-dioxide emissions were within 5% of their 2019 levels, and by September, global emissions were nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. The forecast is that 2020 emissions will likely be between 4 and 7% lower than last year (World Meteorological Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). To keep global warming within 1.5 &#176;C, scientists tell us that emissions must drop by 7% a year on average (World Meteorological Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>).</p>
