To build more ecologically sound and socially just bio-based societies and economies, the EU needs to look beyond affirmative reformist approaches that rely on the existing political and economic institutions, rules, roles, knowledge and relations, which have contributed to socioecological degradation and inequalities (B&#252;scher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Gills and Morgan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>; Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>; Nightingale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2019</xref>; Temper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>), and seek to embrace a decolonial and pluralist approach to justice, environment and development more broadly.</p>
