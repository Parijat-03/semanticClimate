The standardized regression weights are shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Together, the predictors of this model (justice sensitivities, moral disengagement, past pro-environmental behavior) significantly predicted pro-environmental intention, <italic>F</italic>(6, 167) = 66.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, with a large effect size (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2013</xref>), <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.71 (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.70). Adding past behavior as a predictor explained an additional 33% of the variance of pro-environmental intention, incremental <italic>F</italic>(1, 167) = 188.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. While, perpetrator, beneficiary, and victim sensitivity remained non-significant predictors, moral disengagement in high carbon behavior was still significant. Observer sensitivity no longer significantly predicted pro-environmental intention. Past behavior was not only a significant, but also the strongest predictor in this model, followed closely by moral disengagement. Moreover, the inclusion of past behavior also reduced the explanatory power of moral disengagement.</p>
