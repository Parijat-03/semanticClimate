Their access to resources, knowledge, financial services, markets and more varies according to their socio-economic location in society and their ethnicity. At the same time, the findings suggest that a relatively simple empowerment process &#8211; training in wheat&#8211;maize technologies through a women&#8217;s organisation &#8211; has started to enable women to secure access to innovations and start making important choices in their lives. The fact that they have a strong woman as a leader appears pivotal to success. It is worth analysing and verifying this process through an empowerment conceptual lens. Kabeer (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) argues that the ability to make choices is a defining feature of empowerment: to be disempowered implies to be denied choice. The concept of empowerment refers to the processes by which people who have been denied the ability to make choices acquire such an ability. Kabeer considers that the ability to exercise choice can be thought of in terms of three inter-related dimensions: Resources (preconditions) &#8594; Agency (process) &#8594; Achievements (outcomes). Resources include material, human and social resources which serve to enhance the ability to make choice. Agency is the ability to define one&#8217;s goals and act upon them. It can take the form of decisionmaking, bargaining and negotiation, deception and manipulation, subversion and resistance, and the processes of reflection and analysis. Taken together, resources and agency allow women to achieve outcomes important to them (Kabeer <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p>
