In the case of refrigerators, this upward trend was even more impressive, with penetration increasing from 29% in 1993 to 61.3% in 2009 in urban Delhi and from 17.7% to 38% in rural areas. In the 2004&#8211;05 NSSO survey (which provides data on the ownership of air coolers and air conditioners separately unlike in the previous rounds) only 9% have access to air conditioners and only 58% to air coolers in Delhi. However, with increasing incomes, there is a very high probability that the total air conditioning electricity demand could increase substantially (Gupta, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.24" top="617.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="617.43" x1="526.24" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 617.43; y1: 629.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">These patterns imply that the growing middle class of Delhi would be most sensitive to increase in demand and a resultant shortage of electricity as they may not be able to afford expensive power back-up infrastructure. The shortage in power may lead to load shedding, causing discomfort and increasing the need for DG sets for those who can afford them. These may increase greenhouse gases, thus contributing to climate change (Gupta, 2012).The residents of affluent areas in Delhi, may be able to reduce their vulnerability to these changes due to their high adaptive capacity (access to power back-up). The lower rungs (about 52 percent of Delhi&#8217;s population live in informal settlements with little to no access to electricity and other basic amenities) of society would therefore be most vulnerable to increase in temperatures and shortage of electricity.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="167.65" top="446.76"><span x0="72.02" y0="446.76" x1="167.65" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 446.76; y1: 458.76; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity</span><span x0="167.66" y0="446.76" x1="526.35" style="x0: 167.66; x1: 171.0; y0: 446.76; y1: 458.76; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: There are efforts by the Indian government to encourage use of BEE star rated energy efficient appliances and lighting systems to reduce demand for electricity. There are also guidelines being put in place by the Delhi government to curtail energy use in the commercial sector during off-peak hours, these include recent plans to have differential pricing for peak and off peak hours for commercial enterprises that will incentivize energy conservation and reduce power cuts. There are also guidelines put in place by Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) to improve energy efficiency of building. Compliance with ECBC is slated to be compulsory for all new commercial building constructions. These measures if optimally implemented can reduce energy consumption by 40-60 percent.  Buildings are also given tax and other incentives to use solar powered systems (water heater, etc), in terms of capital subsidy and property tax rebates. Additionally, awareness campaigns for energy conservation are being undertaken in Delhi (GNCTD, 2012). There are also a large number of renewable energy initiatives being undertaken by the Delhi government under the National Solar Mission and JNNURM. These include initiatives to promote the use of rooftop solar installations in order to supplement the supply of electricity from the grid. These policies and incentives can reduce the burden on fossil fuel generated electricity.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="207.53" top="181.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="181.72" x1="207.53" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 181.72; y1: 192.76; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2.3 Water Resources  </span><span x0="72.02" y0="166.27" x1="526.09" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 166.27; y1: 178.27; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Fresh water is one of the most valuable natural resources in the world today. With supplies dwindling, the shortage of water is going to be a serious problem in coming decades. India has only ten percent of the worlds freshwater with about 17 percent of the world&#8217;s population (Jackson, et al., 2001). This shortage of water will be particularly pronounced in urban India, with increasing strain on resources through population increase and rising temperatures. </span></div></body></html>
