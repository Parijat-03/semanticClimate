This section assesses the current state of knowledge with respect to past and future emissions of the three major SLCFs and their precursors: mineral dust, carbonaceous aerosols (black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC)) and BVOCs. This section also reports on implications of changes in their emissions for climate. Aerosols particles with diameters between about 0.010 &#956;m to about 20 &#956;m are recognised as SLCFs, a term that refers to their short atmospheric lifetime (a few days). BVOCs are important precursors of ozone and OC, both important climate forcing agents with short atmospheric lifetimes.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.28" top="507.56"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 66.8; y0: 507.56; y1: 517.06; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="507.56" x1="307.28">While the AR5 did not assess land aerosols emissions in depth, their &#64257;ndings stated that although progress in quantifying regional emissions of anthropogenic and natural land aerosols has been made, considerable uncertainty still remains about their historical trends, their inter-annual and decadal variability and about any changes in the future (Calvo et&#160;al. 2013; Klimont et&#160;al. 2017). Some new and improved understanding of processes controlling emissions and atmospheric processing has been developed since AR5, for example, a better understanding of the climatic role of BC as well as the understanding of the role of BVOCs in formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.31" top="363.57"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 363.57; y1: 373.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="363.57" x1="307.31">Depending on the chemical composition and size, aerosols can absorb or scatter sunlight and thus directly affect the amount of absorbed and scattered radiation (Fuzzi et&#160;al. 2015; Nousiainen 2011; de S&#225; et&#160;al. 2019) Aerosols affect cloud formation and development, and thus can also in&#64258;uence precipitation patterns and amounts (Suni&#160;et&#160;al. 2015). In addition, deposition of aerosols&#160;&#8211; especially BC&#160;&#8211; on snow and ice surfaces can reduce albedo and increase warming as a self-reinforcing feedback. Aerosols deposition also changes biogeochemical cycling in critical terrestrial ecosystems, with deposition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (Andreae et&#160;al. 2002). Primary land aerosols are emitted directly into the atmosphere due to natural or anthropogenic processes and include mineral aerosols (or dust), volcanic dust, soot from combustion, organic aerosols from industry, vehicles or biomass burning, bioaerosols from forested regions and others. SOAs are particulates that are formed in the atmosphere by the gas-to-particles conversion processes from gaseous precursors, such as BVOCs, and account for a large fraction of &#64257;ne mode (particles less than 2.5&#956;m) aerosol mass (Hodzic et&#160;al. 2016; Manish et&#160;al. 2017). Land use change can affect the climate through changed emissions of SLCFs such as aerosols, ozone precursors and methane.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.31" top="99.61"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 99.61; y1: 109.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="99.61" x1="307.31">Aerosols from air pollution will decline in the coming years as a means for improving urban and regional air, but their removal will lead to additional warming (Boucher et&#160;al. 2013), with important regional variability, and partially offsetting projected mitigation effects for </span></div><div left="317.77" right="504.12" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 320.58; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.61" x1="504.12">two to three decades in 1.5&#176;C consistent pathways (</span><span style="x0: 504.12; x1: 508.7; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="504.12" y0="735.61" x1="560.93">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 560.93; x1: 563.57; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="560.93" y0="735.61" x1="565.85">) (IPCC 2018). It is important to emphasise that changes in emissions can either be due to external forcing or through a feedback in the climate system (Box 2.1). For instance, enhanced dust emissions due to reduced vegetation could be a forcing if overgrazing is the cause of larger dust emission, or a feedback if dryer climate is the cause. This distinction is important in terms of mitigation measures to be&#160;implemented.</span></div><div left="317.76" right="410.16" top="615.42"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.96; y0: 615.42; y1: 625.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.76" y0="615.42" x1="410.16">2.4.1 Mineral dust</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="591.52"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 323.58; y0: 591.52; y1: 601.02; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="591.52" x1="565.81">One of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols emitted into the atmosphere is mineral dust, a &#8216;natural&#8217; aerosol that is produced by wind strong enough to initiate the emissions process of sandblasting. Mineral dust is preferentially emitted from dry and unvegetated soils in topographic depressions where deep layers of alluvium have been accumulated (Prospero et&#160;al. 2002). Dust is also emitted from disturbed soils by human activities, with a 25% contribution to global emissions based on a satellite-based estimate (Ginoux et&#160;al. 2012).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.78" top="483.54"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 323.22; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="483.54" x1="565.78">Dust is then transported over long distances across continents and oceans.

Dust particles are composed of minerals, including iron oxides which strongly absorb shortwave radiation and provide nutrients for marine ecosystems. Another mineral such as feldspar is an ef&#64257;cient ice nuclei (Harrison et&#160;al. 2016). Dust mineralogy varies depending on the native soils, so global databases were developed to characterise the mineralogical composition of soils for use in weather and climate models (Journet et&#160;al. 2014; Perlwitz et&#160;al. 2015). New &#64257;eld campaigns, as well as new analyses of observations from prior campaigns, have produced insights into the role of dust in western Africa in climate system, such as long-ranged transport of dust across the Atlantic (Gro&#223; et&#160;al. 2015) and the characterisation of aerosol particles and their ability to act as ice and cloud condensation nuclei (Price et&#160;al. 2018). Size distribution at emission is another key parameter controlling dust interactions with radiation. Most models now use the parametrisation of Kok&#160;(2011) based on the theory of brittle material. It was shown that most models underestimate the size of the global dust cycle (Kok 2011).</span></div></body></html>
