In defining &#8220;depoliticisation as the power of non-decision&#8221;, Felli argues that MBMs not only enable the commodification of nature as discussed by several market critics (see later section), but, more importantly, render invisible non-market alternatives such as direct regulation that may lead the state to curtail or constrain the production choices of private actors. Other authors have also highlighted the difficulty in raising the profile of non-market alternatives in the policy debate, whereas carbon market proponents insist only on discussing potential improvements to market approaches (B&#246;hm &amp; Dhabi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Bryant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>).</p>
