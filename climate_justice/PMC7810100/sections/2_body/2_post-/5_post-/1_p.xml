The organizations funding challenges to union dues and fees have also targeted the entire system of exclusive representation. In <italic>Janus</italic>, the majority stated in dicta that &#8220;[i]t is also not disputed that the State may require that a union serve as exclusive bargaining agent for its employees&#8212;itself a significant impingement on associational freedoms that would not be tolerated in other contexts&#8221; (<italic>Janus</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>, 2478). This language gave union opponents an opening to argue that exclusive representation violates employees&#8217; right to freedom of association by forcing them to be represented by a union they do not desire. Thus far these challenges have been unsuccessful, as courts have relied on earlier Supreme Court precedent rejecting a First Amendment challenge to exclusive representation (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 12&#8211;13). As <italic>Janus</italic> proves, however, the Court is not always reluctant to overturn precedent and it remains to be seen whether these arguments will gain traction in the future. The death of Justice Ginsburg and the probable shift of the Court to the right with her replacement may make a successful challenge to excusive representation more likely (Campbell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>).</p>
