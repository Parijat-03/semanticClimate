<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A brief period of regional climatic cooling during a <em>glacial</em> or <em>interglacial</em> interval, often characterized by transient glacial advances. Stadials are generally of short duration (hundreds to a few thousand years) compared to glacial or interglacial intervals (lasting many thousands to tens of thousands of years). One example of a regional stadial event is based on millennial scale cooling recorded by oxygen <em>isotope</em> ratios in Greenland <em>ice cores</em>, the so called âGreenland Stadialsâ (Johnsen et al., 1992).</p>
