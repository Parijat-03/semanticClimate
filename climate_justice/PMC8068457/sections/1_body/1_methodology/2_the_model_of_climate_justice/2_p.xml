This distribution is compatible with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global temperature increase scenario with respect to pre-industrial temperature. The global scenario used is the RCP1.9 IMAGE&#160;3.0.1 SSP1&#8211;19 for Kyoto Gases (excluding CO<sub>2</sub> from land uses) obtained from IIASA (van Vuuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>; IIASA and IAMC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). Despite the 66% likelihood of holding the global mean temperature below 1.5&#160;&#176;C that this scenario implies, it is worth mentioning that the impacts of such an increase are not minor, as is shown in the SR1.5 IPCC SR published in 2018 (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018b</xref>).</p>
