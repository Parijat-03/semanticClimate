The &#8220;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Climate justice: multiple levels, contested narratives</xref>&#8221; section discusses the concept of climate justice and its multiple levels (intra-country, inter-country and intergenerational) and diverse narratives. The &#8220;European Union&#8221; section begins by examining the incorporation of climate justice concerns in EU climate policies and then demonstrates how financial policies and mechanisms are being employed to implement these policies. The &#8220;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref>&#8221; section conducts the same exercise for China, contrasting its &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; policy with the EU&#8217;s climate justice policies and also the development of its green finance frameworks. The &#8220;Comparing the EU and Chinese financial frameworks&#8221; section briefly takes stock of the main similarities and differences of the EU and Chinese financial frameworks. The &#8220;Climate justice at the COVID crossroads&#8221; section discusses the diverging reactions of the EU and China to the economic and social shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, with major implications for climate policy. The &#8220;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Conclusion</xref>&#8221; section concludes that while China and the EU may be utilising a similar set of measures to make their financial systems more sustainable, these measures respond to different prevailing approaches to climate justice in the two jurisdictions. Overall, the EU approach is more closely aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of transforming finance flows, particularly following the announcement of COVID-19 economic packages in both jurisdictions.</p>
