This setting has been heavily criticized as inadequate in terms of safety for the passengers by several actors. Besides, cruise ships pass alongside cargo ships and petrol tankers through the <italic>Malamocco Marghera Canal</italic>, also called <italic>Canale dei Petroli</italic>, dredged in the 1960s to make way for big vessels. Considerations about its enlargement and its opening to passenger transportation go back to at least the 1970s, when the petrol port was enlarged. The canal&#8217;s extension was one of the reasons for increased tidal water. Although a&#160;special law for safeguarding Venice was passed in 1973 (Mancuso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>: 109), it arrived too late to prevent environmental damage. In addition, petrochemical plants at Marghera caused health hazards as toxic waste was dumped into the lagoon. And since the waste settles on the seafloor, experts warn against dredging operations. Highly debated and under construction since 2003, the MOSE barrier is meant to prevent flooding (Mancuso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>: 135). Current political debates focus on the compatibility between the operation of the tidal gates and large ships. In this regard, the MOSE is another contested infrastructure project, since according to its critics its costs outweigh its benefits (Casagrande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>: 127).</p>
