This trend is likely to continue with the economy growing and with most of the growth in cities, rural-urban migration is set to increase population and therefore leads to for further urbanization. The figure below (Delhi Master Plan, 2021) illustrates the land use plan for Delhi, which has been designed to optimize the inter relationship between the urban activities, environment and the image of the city. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="127.7" top="649.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="649.23" x1="127.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure: </span><span x0="135.74" y0="649.23" x1="184.32" style="x0: 135.74; x1: 144.4; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is perhaps the most affected by rapid urbanization, with its population growing at 4.1 percent every year, the highest of any megacity in India (Taubenbock, et al., 2008). This can mostly be attributed to the rural-urban migration that has led to changes in Delhi&#8217;s land use pattern. With Delhi&#8217;s economy growing at over ten percent per annum this trend is likely to continue the increase in urbanization has led to a corresponding decrease in space available for other land use like agriculture. Climate change may further exaggerate the trend of land use change with temperatures rising that might lead to degradation of forests and decrease in productivity of agriculture. Thus incentivizing further urbanization (National Climate Centre, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="272.14"><span x0="72.02" y0="272.14" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 272.14; y1: 284.14; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="132.14" y0="272.14" x1="526.15" style="x0: 132.14; x1: 138.81; y0: 272.14; y1: 284.14; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Forest and agricultural land would be the most sensitive to changes in climate and land use, which may lead to a decrease in the moisture available for growth of plants and may therefore lead to degradation of these lands. This may lead to the use of this land for the purposes of building urban housing (National Climate Centre, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="177.5" top="196.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="196.63" x1="177.5" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 196.63; y1: 208.63; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity: </span><span x0="180.38" y0="196.63" x1="526.41" style="x0: 180.38; x1: 187.05; y0: 196.63; y1: 208.63; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Several initiatives have been undertaken by the GNCTD to spread awareness about the importance of planting trees. These campaigns have been widely supported by corporate social responsibility initiatives by Indian corporate enterprises. Agricultural activities taking place in the rural outskirts of the city have also been incentivized through the use of sustainable agricultural practices and other incentives. This would help sustain agriculture as a source of livelihood and reduce rural-urban migration. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.28" top="89.45"><span x0="72.02" y0="89.45" x1="526.28" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 89.45; y1: 101.45; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Land use changes due to rapid urbanization may be exaggerated by climate change. Change in land use would disproportionately affect agricultural and forest land. The government, under </span></div></body></html>
