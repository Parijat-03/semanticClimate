<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0040">WNV transmission requires the presence of competent vectors, a suitable climate and a susceptible host population. Studying WNV transmission at a macro scale presents significant challenges, since key data on the seasonal and annual abundance of competent mosquitoes and birds are not available; this is further complicated given the hundreds of potential host bird species in Europe <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To explain human infections, we therefore use environmental risk factors known to attract vector, and host. Furthermore, vector abundance for a given season is modulated by physical and environmental factors, such as temperature, rainfall and water resource availability <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We therefore use proxies that can predict mosquito abundance.</p>
