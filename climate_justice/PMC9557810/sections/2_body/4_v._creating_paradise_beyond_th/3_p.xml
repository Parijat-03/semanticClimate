<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As argued by Paulo Freire,<sup>(<xref rid="fn43-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">43</xref>)</sup> the main method of critical pedagogy is dialogue, a
dialogue adapted to each context, in which everyone can actively participate through
the following process: (a) by encouraging women and men to develop their own
critical consciousness in order to effect change in their world through social
critique and political action; (b) by critically understanding one&#8217;s own practice;
and (c) by changing our practices in order to tackle common struggles and act upon
reality. By collectivizing consciousness, resistance and contestation, as well as
possibilities, sensibilities and hope, we are witnessing a contemporary reinvention
of popular urbanism, driven by social movements, as a simultaneous practice of what
Motta and Esteves call <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;pedagogising the political and politicising the
pedagogical&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn44-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">44</xref>)</sup> This double practice challenges the logics of neoliberal
capitalism, of patriarchy and of racism and their hegemonic translation into
systemic urban inequalities. It does so by subverting the marginalization of
ordinary citizens, by embodying learning in their practices and in the everyday life
experiences of the urban, by generating spaces to unlearn the oppressor&#8217;s logic, by
re-signifying the social and the public, and by pluralizing the
<italic toggle="yes">saberes</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">haceres</italic> that make a just city a
concrete field of imagination and action.</p>
