Like these proposals, this one also takes inspiration from Indigenous land and water defenders, climate justice activists, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. This reorientation of values&#8212;a rethinking of security, well-being, citizenship, and justice, and a departure from capitalism and imperialism&#8212;is critical if we are to survive climate change without condemning much of humanity, following racial logics, along with nature itself, to disposability (Ajl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>).</p>
