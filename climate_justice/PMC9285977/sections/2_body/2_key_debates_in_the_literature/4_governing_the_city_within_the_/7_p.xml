<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In their now&#8208;classic analysis of climate change governance in four municipal governments in the Gothenburg region, Sweden, Lundqvist and von Borgstede (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0194" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) argued that planning officials resort to established scalar arrangements for collaboration, which may cement existing assemblages of power and lock planning trajectories into pre&#8208;defined agendas of growth and development. Similarly, the local capacity to operate in a multilevel context is conditioned by historical&#8208;political events, which influences how action is recognized, while also shaping relations and resource interdependencies over time (Eckersley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0119" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0120" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The devolution of power to lower&#8208;level authorities does not guarantee more effective climate action (Rumbach, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0248" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). At the bottom of the theoretical and practical problems of the multilevel governance literature is an ongoing theoretical challenge related to how to insert urban areas within the institutional landscape of nation states or the global climate regime.</p>
