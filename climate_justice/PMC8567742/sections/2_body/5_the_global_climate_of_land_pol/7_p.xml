The goal seems to be to seize the greater portion of land, water, grazing land and forests, freeing them from so-called inefficient land users and land uses, and reallocating them to efficient users and uses. Meanwhile, for the working poor people who depend on land for a livelihood, fully or partially, or for those who would choose such a livelihood but are currently outside the agrarian system, the only way to secure access to land and resources is through the market. This means in practice that their chances are almost zero, because they are the least able to participate in any land sales and rental market.</p>
