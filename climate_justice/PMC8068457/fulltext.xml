The mentioned goal is of special interest for regions like the Mediterranean where the average temperature is rising above the world average with the consequential risk for the future viability of its different ecosystems. The objective of this work is to analyze if the commitments of the Mediterranean Basin countries submitted under the Paris Agreement framework are in line with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal. For this analysis, the cumulative emissions of the current Nationally Determined Contributions of these countries until 2030, are compared with the result obtained from distributing the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions compatible with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global mitigation scenario between 2018 and 2100. This distribution is obtained using the Model of Climate Justice that allocates the global emissions by using equity criteria (equality and responsibility) that take into consideration the historical responsibility for each country, in the period from 1994 to 2017. There are two main conclusions from the analysis of the NDCs. Firstly, it is concluded that the Mediterranean Basin countries, as a whole, are not in line with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal, because by 2030, 77% of the emissions budget that should be available until 2100, based on the equity criteria aforementioned, will already have been emitted. And, secondly, when the NDCs for each one of the countries are compared, some significant differences in the degree of ambition can be seen.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mitigation</kwd><kwd>Paris Agreement</kwd><kwd>NDCs</kwd><kwd>Cumulative emissions</kwd><kwd>Climate Justice</kwd><kwd>Mediterranean</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature B.V. 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Mediterranean Basin constitutes a geographic and climatic unit that spans three continents and is especially sensitive to the adverse effects of climate change. The increase in the average surface temperature of this region is above the observed global increase, and it has already exceeded 1.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with respect to the pre-industrial period temperature (1880&#x02013;1899) (Medecc Network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). Likewise, heat waves are more frequent, severely affecting urban areas, and drought intensity and frequency are also increasing, causing water availability problems in some regions (Cramer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>; Lange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>). The socioeconomic impacts of climate stress have been described in a wide variety of areas. Recent studies have shown severe impacts on crop production and a decreasing wheat yield (Danzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). Rises in sea levels will alter the shape of coasts, seriously affecting coastal low-areas such as deltas and impacting strategic economic sectors (Ciscar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>; L&#x000f3;pez-D&#x000f3;riga and Jim&#x000e9;nez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Predictions indicate that even achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, the risk of drought is likely to increase, and precipitations and surface runoffs are likely to decrease (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018a</xref>). These risks are significantly less in the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global scenario. This scenario would allow ecosystems to stay within the variability observed during the Holocene. In scenarios leading to 2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or more warming, Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystems would experience unprecedented changes never seen in the Holocene (Guiot and Cramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Despite having a common historical legacy and cultural tradition, the 21 countries from the Mediterranean Basin present a significant socioeconomic diversity (Medecc Network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). Among this group, there are developing and developed countries, eight of which belong to the EU27. In terms of income level in the World Bank (WB) classification, Syria is classified as a low-income country; Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco are lower-middle-income countries; Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon, Libya, Montenegro, and Turkey are upper-middle-income countries; the remaining 10, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Slovenia, and Spain, are high-income countries (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>). In addition to socioeconomic diversity, some of these countries have suffered or are suffering from severe armed conflicts, and there are humanitarian emergencies in the Mediterranean Sea, such as the current refugee crisis, that highlight the necessity to reinforce cooperation between both sides of the Mediterranean (Albahari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>; Panebianco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Mediterranean countries also share a sense of identity, the Mediterranean, and a willingness to cooperate on environmental issues that seek to preserve the integrity of the different ecosystems and to underpin sustainable development. Since 1975 this willingness to cooperate is articulated under the Mediterranean Action Plan &#x02013; Barcelona Convention and its related protocols (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>). Likewise, the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development 2016&#x02013;2025 (MSSD) aims to promote regional and national plans, by improving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (UNEP/MAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Among other objectives, the MSSD sets out that addressing climate change must be a priority for the Mediterranean and recognizes that climate change constitutes a severe risk for economic growth and development in this area. Moreover, since 2008, the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) promotes cooperation among countries from the European Union and 15 countries from the South and East of the Mediterranean. Among other things, the UfM mandate is to support and advise its member countries on the elaboration, review, and implementation of their climate action commitments within the Paris Agreement context (Union for the Mediterranean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The Paris Agreement (PA) will be the multilateral framework for climate change global policy from now on. The justice and equity discussion has always been present in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), often articulated under the &#x0201c;common, but differentiated, responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR&#x00026;RC)&#x0201d; (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1992</xref>). The text of the PA, Article 2.2, establishes that the agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the CBDR&#x00026;RC principle. The mitigation section, in Article 4.1, clearly states that the long-term temperature goal should be achieved on the basis of equity (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The bottom-up nature of the PA leaves the elaboration of their mitigation commitments, which are then incorporated into their nationally determined contributions (NDC), in the hands of each country that belongs to the agreement. This implies, to a large extent, that the states are also responsible for implementing the PA equitably. Throughout 2020, 2021, and up until the COP26 that will be held in Glasgow, parties belonging to the PA must communicate or update their commitments; and it will be imperative they do this task looking towards achieving the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global goal, constructing their contributions with an equity vision in a global context. Furthermore, countries are strongly encouraged, when communicating or updating their first NDC, to provide the necessary information for the clarity, transparency, and comprehension contained in the Annex I of the additional orientations regarding the mitigation section <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>/CP.21, approved in decision 4/CMA.1 during COP24 (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Paragraph&#x000a0;6 in the previously cited Annex I explicitly requests that parties justify how their NDC is fair and ambitious in the light of their national circumstances. Paragraph&#x000a0;7 requires parties to explain how their NDC contributes to the achievement of the global average temperature stabilization goal defined in the UNFCCC and more precisely in the PA. Based on these requirements, it is necessary to establish references that can be used by parties to define their specific contribution in order to achieve the global temperature goals and, at the same time, that can be used to measure the degree of justice and ambition of their contributions.</p><p id="Par8">In the literature, there are models that aim to globally achieve the temperature goal of the PA by distributing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among the countries fairly (Baer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Kanitkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>; Winkler et al.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Raupach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>; Alcaraz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). All of these models use as distribution criteria some of the equity principles found in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5): equality, responsibility, capacity, and the right to sustainable development (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). Some models have been used as a benchmark to evaluate equity and the degree of ambition in the NDCs submitted by countries leading the global emissions ranking (Robiou du Pont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>; Robiou Du Pont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>; Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2018</xref>; Winkler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). Nevertheless, to date, there are no published studies with a focus on the Mediterranean geographical area.</p><p id="Par9">Considering both that the Mediterranean Basin is a hot spot for climate change and also the socioeconomic risks that the whole area faces, it is very urgent to look beyond every country&#x02019;s individualism and the European Union&#x02019;s limits and promoting cooperation between countries. The fact that there already exist multilateral cooperation entities working on climate action, the authors consider it may be of special interest for policy-makers to analyze the ambition of the&#x000a0;mitigation component from the NDCs of the 21 Mediterranean arch countries under the climate justice prism. This analysis shows whether or not countries&#x02019; commitments, individually and as a group, are in line with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global mitigation goal. The analysis is performed by comparing the cumulative emissions that current NDCs would imply by 2030, with the result obtained from the distribution among all countries of the cumulative GHG emission compatible with the 1.5&#x000b0;C temperature scenario. The model used for this distribution is the Model of Climate Justice (MCJ) described by Alcaraz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>), which distributes the global emissions using equality and responsibility criteria considering the historical responsibility from each country.</p><p id="Par10">Based on the description above, the layout of this article is as follows: Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> will describe the methodology followed and the data set used for the analysis. Next, Section <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">3</xref> will present the results and discussion for the distribution of the cumulative emission allocated by the MCJ for Mediterranean countries until the end of the century, and based on the results of this distribution, the degree of ambition of the NDCs presented by countries will be evaluated. Finally, in Section <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, the main conclusions of this study will be summarized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Studied countries</title><p id="Par11">The countries studied in this article include those with a coastline in the Mediterranean Sea and that constitute the geographic entity of the Mediterranean Basin (UNEP-MAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>). Monaco remains excluded from the study since the emissions from energy production in this country are included in the French accounting and its weight in global Mediterranean emissions is negligible (0.0051% of the GHG emissions in 2017) (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019a</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows a set of indicators from Mediterranean countries that enable the assessment of notable differences between them. On the one hand, we can find countries with a GDP per capita and historical emissions per capita that are relatively low compared with the world average. One of these countries is Morocco, which has a relatively low energy consumption per capita. However, its emissions intensity is high, which indicates that regardless of its low energy consumption, its economy relies on fossil-origin energy resources. On the other hand, there are countries like France, which has a high ranking GDP per capita, with emissions per capita that are above the world average and a high energy consumption. However, because France is a world power in nuclear technology, its emissions intensity is one of the lowest in the region. The comparison of EU27 member and non-member countries is especially interesting. Altogether, the EU27 countries have a higher level of emissions, energy consumption, and GDP per capita, but lower emissions intensity levels.

This is a highly controversial and nonconsensual topic between the parties, hence its enormous complexity. For this reason, the Model of Climate Justice (MCJ) should be understood only as a reference in order to be able to assess under the same metric the mitigation commitments established in the NDCs.</p><p id="Par14">The Model of Climate Justice (MCJ) is used to distribute the cumulative GHG emissions for the 2018&#x02013;2100 period corresponding to each one of the studied countries (Alcaraz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). This distribution is compatible with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global temperature increase scenario with respect to pre-industrial temperature. The global scenario used is the RCP1.9 IMAGE&#x000a0;3.0.1 SSP1&#x02013;19 for Kyoto Gases (excluding CO<sub>2</sub> from land uses) obtained from IIASA (van Vuuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>; IIASA and IAMC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). Despite the 66% likelihood of holding the global mean temperature below 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C that this scenario implies, it is worth mentioning that the impacts of such an increase are not minor, as is shown in the SR1.5 IPCC SR published in 2018 (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018b</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">The other data needed to calculate the MCJ are the historical GHG emissions data obtained from the PRIMAP-hist dataset&#x000a0;(G&#x000fc;tschow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>); and the historical data and future projections of the population are taken from the UNDESA medium variant scenario (UNDESA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">The MCJ distributes the emissions on the basis of equality and historical responsibility criteria. It tends to an equalization of the future per capita emissions taking into account the future population projections and applies a correction considering historical responsibility. The model allocates more emissions to countries that were historically below the world average per capita emissions and penalizes those who were above. For further insights on the mathematical details of the MCJ, the authors recommend the reading of Annex I contained in the supplementary electronic material of Alcaraz et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>) paper.</p><p id="Par17">The year from which historical responsibility is considered influences the resulting emissions distribution and cannot be exempted from discussion (M&#x000fc;ller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>; Rocha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Some authors suggest that historical responsibility should be considered from the beginning of the industrial revolution since developed countries&#x02019; progress has been tightly linked to their increase in emissions (Cao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Kanitkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). Some others propose that historical responsibility can only be demanded from the moment the international community became conscious of the climate change problem and this would place the date in the early 1990s (Ott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Baer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Gignac and Matthews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). The first IPCC report was published in 1990, and this is when the negotiations that would be taken to the approval of the UNFCCC in Rio-92 were started. After the ratification process, the UNFCCC entered into force in 1994. This date, 1994, marks a point of no return in the multilateral fight against climate change and is the one used in this article when starting to account for historical responsibility.</p><p id="Par18">The results of the MCJ are the cumulative GHG emissions for the 2018&#x02013;2100 period for each one of the countries studied.

As a whole, Mediterranean basin countries have a historical responsibility, evaluated as cumulative emissions per capita, similar to the world average. This is the reason why the MCJ allocates in the future for this region, a global emissions percentage similar to the population percentage represented by this region with respect to the world.</p><p id="Par31">The correspondence observed between the Mediterranean cumulative emissions and population percentages with respect to the world is broken when the Mediterranean countries included in the UNFCCC Annex I and non-Annex I are analyzed separately (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Responsibilities from Annex I and non-Annex I countries are clearly differentiated. In the historical period considered, Mediterranean Annex I countries, in which 56% of the region&#x02019;s population is concentrated, have been responsible for 70% of the emissions. In contrast, the non-Annex I group, with 44% of the population, has been responsible for 30% of the emissions. This confirms that the historical distribution of the Mediterranean emissions has not been egalitarian. For this reason, when the MCJ is used to calculate the distribution of future emissions, this situation is reversed. It should also be taken into account that according to the UNDESA prospects, in 2100, the population of non-Annex I countries will increase by 81% while the population of Annex I countries will decrease by 13% with respect to 2017. This significantly changes the population distribution between these two groups, with non-Annex I countries hosting 57% of the Mediterranean population (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and this affects the distribution of emissions made by the MCJ when it applies the principle of equality.

This is due to the specific situation of Turkey among the Annex I countries, which will be discussed throughout this paper. When Turkey is excluded from the Annex I country group or, in other words, when Mediterranean countries that are part of the EU27 and those that are not are analyzed separately, a vision complementary to the previous one is obtained.</p><p id="Par34">The group of 8 Mediterranean EU27 member countries has been responsible for 57% of the region&#x02019;s cumulative emissions in the historical period, and if it follows a distribution of the future cumulative emissions based on equity criteria, it will only be allocated 29% of the future emissions. This group should address its immediate future with very drastic emissions reductions. Fortunately, these countries have been implementing GHG emissions reduction policies. These policies have led to a gradual reduction of the historical responsibility per capita. The GHG emissions per capita, which in 1994 were 8.85 tCO<sub>2eq</sub>, had already been reduced down to 7.36 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> by the end of 2017. In Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, these details will be discussed.</p><p id="Par35">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows both the details of the released cumulative emissions in the historical period and the ones allocated by the MCJ in the future, allowing a comparison to be made.

However, based on equity, some countries should make reduction efforts above the world average while others could remain below.

The former indicates an 18% emission increase with respect to the base year, 1990, and the latter shows a 3% reduction. Montenegro only presents an unconditional target with a reduction of 30% with respect to 1990; however, it can allow for a much more ambitious target since, if it follows a trend scenario, it will already have reduced its emissions by nearly 50%.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Israel, a high-income country with a commitment that, according to the MCJ framework, is unambitious. It is particularly concerning that the emissions of this country have not yet started to decrease and that the country has not yet expressed any intention to review the NDC submitted in 2016 (Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Turkey, an upper-middle-income country that belongs to Annex I of the UNFCCC, despite the fact that it has repeatedly shown its desire to abandon this categorization (Republic of Turkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>).

As mentioned before, the MCJ allocates a future emissions budget to Turkey that is similar to the one used for the 1994&#x02013;2017 period. This budget, if managed properly, would allow it to make a smooth transition to a low emission development pathway. The fact that its INDC, by 2030, already uses more than its entire budget, and also that its emissions are increasing, means that this country is far offtrack from the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Libya deserves a separate comment.

This takes the Mediterranean Basin countries away from the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal, an extremely important target for both the survival of the ecosystems and the maintenance of the lifestyle of the human population within this region.</p><p id="Par55">From the analysis conducted in this section, it can be observed that some countries are on target to achieve the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal. Within this group, there are developing countries with emissions per capita below the world average, to which the MCJ allocates a budget for the future period higher than that emitted in the historical period considered. One argument here could be that perhaps these countries do not need their entire allocated emissions budget and that a &#x0201c;communicating vessels&#x0201d; effect should be incorporated into the distribution model or a possible implementation of it. However, before entering into this type of argument, it is necessary to consider both the historical evolution of and the socioeconomical differences between these countries.</p><p id="Par56">Next, and without entering in detail for each country, two significant complementary groups are analyzed: the Mediterranean countries that are in the EU27 (all of them, high-income countries) whose climate action is developed within the European Union common framework, and the countries that are not in this group.</p><p id="Par57">In the upper section of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the evolution of per capita emissions as a function of GDP per capita for the EU27 Mediterranean basin country group is compared with the non-EU27 group. In the figure, it can be observed that for some years now, countries from the EU27 have entered into a stage in which emissions per capita and GDP per capita are decoupled and that they are maintaining an economic growth that does not imply an increase of the emissions per capita. As seen in the lower-left section in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the cumulative emissions of these countries in the historical period have been higher than those from non-EU27 countries, and therefore, they have a smaller future emissions budget. Their capacity to undertake a very ambitious mitigation supported by a higher GDP per capita should enable them to increase their NDC ambition, which is currently not compatible with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C scenario.
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The Mediterranean countries belonging to the EU27 (left section) are compared with countries not belonging to the EU27 (right section). In the upper section, the graph shows the evolution of the emissions per capita from these countries in function with the GDP per capita. The lower section shows the cumulative emissions per capita from the historical period, in addition to, firstly, those allocated by the MCJ and, secondly, those that would be consumed according to the NDC as at 2030</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10584_2021_3070_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par58">On the other hand, it is observed that the group of Mediterranean countries that do not belong to the EU27 has not yet reached a decoupling between economic growth and emissions. Observing the trend for recent years, it may still take a few years to reach this point. It is also important to notice that the vertical scales of the two graphs are different. In terms of emissions per capita, the highest value reached by the non-EU27 countries is still below the lowest value reached by the EU27 countries, and the same situation occurs when their GDPs are compared. These two groups are situated in very different socioeconomic realities, and there is a gap between them that needs to be closed.</p><p id="Par59">Taking into account that these groups are internally heterogeneous, and also according to Al-Zahrani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>), it can be said that the EU27 Mediterranean country group has reached a stage of decoupling between economic growth and emissions. On the other hand, as a whole, the non-EU27 country group is still in an industrialization stage in which, historically, development goes hand in hand with an increase in emissions. Consequently, it is foreseeable that the group of non-EU27 countries will need to use the atmospheric space that the MCJ grants them. This space should be dedicated to achieving a decent standard of living for their population, in other words, dedicated to the development agenda: housing, food, health care, water supply and sanitation, electricity, transport, communications, climate change adaptation, etc. (Rao and Baer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par60">It is concerning to confirm (see the lower section of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) that, by 2030, the group of EU countries will have consumed and exceeded the emissions budget allocated by the MCJ until the end of the century. To some extent, this excess use could be read as an appropriation of the atmospheric space that should be available for the developing countries. This reaffirms the view that the authors have previously mentioned: that the high-income Mediterranean countries (the EU27 group and Israel) should notably increase the ambition of their NDCs in order to make them not only compatible with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C global scenario but also to contribute to implementing the PA on the basis of equity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">Global warming is undoubtedly advancing, and the world is rapidly approaching the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C threshold established in the PA (WMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2020</xref>). The emissions mitigation pathways compatible with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal entail drastic reductions, reductions that should be at least 7.6% per year in the 2020&#x02013;2030 period. Nevertheless, GHG emissions continue to increase, and at a global level, the commitments for 2030 that are stated by countries in their current NDCs lead humanity away from the goal (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>; H&#x000f6;hne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">During 2020, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected the world, global emissions were drastically reduced during the obligatory confinements around the world (by 17% during the beginning of April). Even so, it is expected that by the end of 2020, the annual reduction will only be around 7%, and if no deep structural changes in the economic, transport, and energy systems are made, it is expected that emissions will rise again during the economic recovery (Le Qu&#x000e9;r&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">At a regional level, the impacts of global warming are becoming more acute and occurring in different ways all over the planet. In the Mediterranean region, if additional mitigation measures are not implemented, the average increase in temperature is likely to reach 2.2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as early as 2040. This will jeopardize the viability of the ecosystems in this region as well as the possibility of maintaining its peoples&#x02019; lifestyles and centuries-old cultural traditions (Medecc Network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">The reviewed NDCs that countries must produce during 2020 and 2021 could be the last opportunity to get the world onto the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C pathway. This article analyzes the commitments of the Mediterranean Basin countries with the intention of providing a methodology for this analysis, as is explained in Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. The main conclusions are summarized below.</p><p id="Par65">From the distribution analysis obtained using the MCJ, it is concluded that there are countries (Mediterranean countries belonging to the EU27 plus Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, Libya, and Montenegro) that should address their future with an emissions budget reduction from 2018 to 2100, which is, with respect to the historical one (1994&#x02013;2017), higher than the global average reduction. Then there are countries (Algeria and Turkey) that can have a future budget similar to the one emitted in the historical period considered. And finally, there are countries (Albania, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia) able to have a future emissions budget that can exceed the historical by more than 30%.</p><p id="Par66">With regard to the commitments submitted by the countries in their current NDCs, it can be observed that by 2030, the Mediterranean country group will have already consumed 77% of the emissions that the MCJ allocates until the end of the century. This means that, globally, the NDCs of the Mediterranean countries are not on the path to the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal.</p><p id="Par67">The following conclusions are gathered from the NDC analysis:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par68">High-income countries (countries from the EU27 and Israel) should review their first NDC by considerably increasing their ambition in order to align it with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal. These countries have GDPs per capita that are higher than the region&#x02019;s average and can support their capacity for ambitious mitigation. The revision of the EU27 NDC presented in December 2020 is an important step in order to regain leadership on climate change mitigation and to set an example for the international community. However, to assess the impact that the updated NDC will have at the Mediterranean level, we will have to wait until the EU27 carries out a new distribution of emissions reduction among its member countries.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">At a Mediterranean level, cooperation strategies should be launched in order to achieve conditional commitments that figure in the NDCs of countries such as Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. This would enable those that are not aligned with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal to achieve this target and will also help the whole regional group to move towards this direction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par70">Turkey, which has a future emissions budget similar to the historical one, has a not very ambitious NDC that consumes almost the entirety of it. The country should rethink its development model in order to reach the peak of emissions as soon as possible and then start a transition to a low emission model.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par71">Albania, Egypt, Morocco, and Syria are countries that in 2030 will not have consumed the 40% of the emissions budget assigned to them by the MCJ, and therefore they are in line with the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal. It is important that they manage this budget properly in order to make it available to their development agenda and, in this way, achieve a coordinated implementation of their climate change and adaptation policies together with their sustainable development agenda.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par72">The authors hope that this analysis will serve policy-makers when reviewing their countries&#x02019; NDCs and also it shows the need to establish a cooperation framework that allows the regional group to move towards the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal. A goal that should be a priority for the world and especially for the Mediterranean region.</p><p id="Par73">The review of the NDCs will reveal how the world envisions managing the post-pandemic future. The recovery path that is undertaken from now on may turn the global emissions reduction anticipated for 2020 into a merely circumstantial event or an event that can serve as a guide towards achieving the 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C goal (Forster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Given the severity of the situation we are facing, a low emission sustainable development plan within a framework of both regional and international cooperation should be the only option.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par74">When the revision of this article was made, at the end of January 2021, the U27 had presented its NDC update.
