Analyzing the climate laws and national adaptation plans of both countries, she finds that they only partially incorporate concerns for equality and nondiscrimination, participation, transparency, and monitoring and accountability, and pay even less attention to the key elements of the right to health&#8212;availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of health care. Further, although the World Health Organization has issued guidelines on incorporating health into national adaptation plans, these two countries&#8217; plans do not explicitly embrace health rights. As a result, the climate laws and plans in Brazil and Colombia fail to ensure that their public health care systems will be adequately prepared to meet the health needs of the people most vulnerable to climate change impacts.</p>
