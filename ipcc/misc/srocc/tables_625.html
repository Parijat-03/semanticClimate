Adaptation: Large benefits by\nimproving resilience of food crop production systems to climate change (IPBES 2018) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.24).\nDesertification: Large benefits by improving soil health and sustainable use of land in dry areas (D&#8217;Odorico\net al. 2013) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.31). Land degradation: Large benefits since it forms a major component of\nrecommended practices for sustainable land management (Altieri and Nicholls 2017) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.39).\nFood security: Large benefits since it can increase yield and yield stability to enhance food production, though\nthis is not always the case (Pan et al. 2009; Soussana et al. 2019; Hijbeek et al. 2017b; Schj&#248;nning et al. 2018)\n(Chapter 5 and Table 6.47).</td>

Adaptation: Large benefits since soil erosion control prevents desertification (large benefits) and land\ndegradation (large benefits), thereby improving the resilience of agriculture to climate change (Lal 1998; FAO and ITPS\n2015) (Chapters 2, 3 and 4, and Tables 6.23, 6.30 and 6.39). Food security: Large benefits mainly through the preserva-\ntion of crop productivity (Lal 1998) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.47).</td>

Mitigation: There are no studies to quantify the global\nimpacts (Table 6.15). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by allowing existing crop systems to be maintained, reducing the\nneed to abandon land (Dagar et al. 2016; UNCTAD 2011) (Table 6.23). Desertification and land degradation: Moder-\nate benefits since soil salinisation is a main driver of both desertification and land degradation (Rengasamy 2006; Dagar\net al. 2016) (Chapters 3 and 4, and Tables 6.31 and 6.39). Food security: Moderate benefits by maintaining existing\ncropping systems and helping to close yield gaps in rainfed crops (Table 6.47).</td>

      <td>Techniques to prevent and reverse soil compaction are based on the combination of suitable crop rotations, tillage\nand regulation of agricultural traffic (Hamza and Anderson 2005). Mitigation: The global mitigation potential has not\nbeen quantified (Chamen et al. 2015; Epron et al. 2016; Tullberg et al. 2018) (Table 6.15). Adaptation: Limited benefits\nby improving productivity but on relatively small global areas (Table 6.22). Desertification: no global data (Table 6.31).\nLand degradation: Large benefits since soil compaction is a main driver of land degradation (FAO and ITPS 2015)\n(Table 6.39).

Food security: Limited benefits by increasing crop yields in\nthe tropics &#8211; though not in temperate regions (Jeffery et al. 2017) &#8211; but potentially Large negative impacts by creating\nadditional pressure on land if large quantities of biomass feedstock are required for biochar production (Table 6.47).</td>
