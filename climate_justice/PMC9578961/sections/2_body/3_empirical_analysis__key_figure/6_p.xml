<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0265">It is important to highlight some facts: intuitively, all pertinent SDGs (6) express the economic dimensions. Most of them entail both the economic and social dimensions combined, which are widely covered all over the SDGs (5 of the 6 SDGs examined). Another SDG pertains only to the economic dimension. As the fourth pillar of sustainability (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Meadows et&#160;al., 1972</xref>) governance is only considered in 1 of the 17 SDGs. Importantly, the environmental dimension is neglected, not appearing in any of the examined SDGs (0).</p>
