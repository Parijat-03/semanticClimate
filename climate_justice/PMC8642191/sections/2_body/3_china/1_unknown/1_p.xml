The political system is addressing these concerns under the broad goal of building an &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; (or &#8216;Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization&#8217; since its adoption by the current leader). This concept is less anthropocentric than prevailing Western narratives of climate justice (in theory, at least) and also less focused on &#8216;just transition&#8217; or intra-country distributive justice.</p>
