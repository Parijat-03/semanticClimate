<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0005">Despite decades of development efforts by the global community to combat the problem of food and nutrition insecurity in the world, hunger and undernourishment have persisted, especially in the developing world. In fact, it is reported that the number of people suffering from undernourishment has been on the rise since 2015 (<xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2021a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, policymakers and practitioners have been relentless in seeking solutions to this persistent and critical problem widely recognized as a major cause of suffering for millions of people worldwide. It is now apparent which people or groups of people in the world are most affected by food insecurity. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are known to be among the most food insecure populations (<xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Ogutu and Qaim, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Fanzo, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Sibhatu and Qaim, 2017</xref>). Within smallholder groups, women, youth and indigenous people stand out as particularly more affected. Hence, the call in the recent State of the Food and Nutrition Security in the World report for their inclusion in the future food systems' discussions and actions (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2021</xref>). In this paper, we focus on the need for integration of women's roles and needs in the development of policy and practice involving the future food systems.</p>
