Our food systems are particularly vulnerable. In farming, there are &#8220;yield shocks&#8221; caused by temperature extremes. Climate shocks create and exacerbate poverty and food insecurity by affecting the supply of and access to food. Climate shocks can reverse progress toward a world without hunger.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
