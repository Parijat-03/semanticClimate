These long-established practices and commitments to presenting &#8220;truth&#8221; and the &#8220;facts&#8221; perpetuate the status of scientific knowledge and continue to privilege a knowledge system that has been primarily White and Western-oriented. These observations prompt questions about other voices, about knowledge and experiences being silenced, and about the privilege that certain epistemologies hold. We suggest that fourth-generation science museums can disrupt traditional (grand) science narratives, honour a diversity of voices, and begin to share &#8220;epistemic authority&#8221;.</p>
