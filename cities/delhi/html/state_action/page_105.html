This has disturbed the hydrological balance leading to decline in the productivity of wells, increasing pumping costs and more energy requirement.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="259.36" top="587.4"><span x0="72.02" y0="587.4" x1="259.36" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 587.4; y1: 599.4; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The groundwater table in Delhi has depleted to 20 &#8211;30 metres in various areas across the city. Compared to a level of 30 &#8211; 40 feet at the time of independence, the water table has dropped to 350 feet at certain places. It is said to be falling at the rate of 10 feet per year on an average. Groundwater levels have depleted by 2 &#8211; 6m in Alipur and Kanjhawla blocks, 10m in the Najafgarh block, and about 20 m in Mehrauliblock. In addition to the quantity, the quality of groundwater is also deteriorating and in several places it has been found to be unfit for human consumption. The salinity of groundwater is increasing in south-west and north-west Delhi while nitrate content is also found to be more than 1,000 mg/l. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.37" top="321.46"><span x0="72.02" y0="321.46" x1="508.37" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 321.46; y1: 333.46; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Along with the increasing demand for water, the highly non- uniform distribution of water supply add to the water woes in Delhi. Unplanned growth of the city had also upset the water supply distribution system. To meet the demand-supply gap, users depend on water sold through tankers by private companies whose source of water is groundwater. This imbalance is further exacerbated by the high level of Non-Revenue Water &#8211; including both technical and commercial losses which estimate to 40-50%. The ability to identify the losses is further constrained due to lack of bulk metering for transmission and distribution systems. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="300.41" top="176.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="176.23" x1="300.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 176.23; y1: 188.23; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">10.2Institutions involved in Water Sector </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.44" top="148.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="148.63" x1="508.44" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 148.63; y1: 160.63; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi Jal Board (DJB) is the sole government agency responsible for water supply in the city.
