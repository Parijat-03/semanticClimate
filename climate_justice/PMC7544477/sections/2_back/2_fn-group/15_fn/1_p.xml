The letter cited here (by Dr. Rita Wong in September 2020) during the final revisions to the article was written in relation to these latter trials and sentencing hearings as the land defenders faced 28-days in jail during a pandemic. Two of the land protectors were quite surprised that they were being prosecuted based on surveillance camera footage of them in ceremony and praying for 30&#160;min in front of a TMX road before leaving on their own, with authorities not following the injunction's own procedures (that require a 5-step process including notification by police and opportunities to leave before arrest).</p>
