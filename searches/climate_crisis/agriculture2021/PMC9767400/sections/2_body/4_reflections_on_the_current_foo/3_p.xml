<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0110">It is time to structurally embed a strong gender lens in food systems to ensure food security solutions benefit all, especially in terms of access and utilization. There is a need to move beyond an instrumental narrative in food security debates, to break down the current status quo that everyone in low-income populations is impacted in the same way by food insecurity and to tailor food security solutions towards those most in need by building on their rich and resilient knowledge and practices. Yes, as literature affirms, though primarily involved in the food production and consumption process, women are among those most affected by the problems resulting from food insecurity. Hence, it is time to also view them as the key solution to challenge food insecurity.</p>
