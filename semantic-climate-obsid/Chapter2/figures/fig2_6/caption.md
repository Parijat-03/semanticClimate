Panel a depicts CO2-FFI emissions over the past 5 decades (GtCO2yr-1). The single year declines in emissions following major economic and geopolitical events are shown, as well as the decline recorded in 5 different datasets for emissions in 2020 (COVID-19) compared to 2019 (no COVID-19). 

Panel b depicts the change in global daily carbon emissions (MtCO2 per day) in 2020 compared to 2019, showing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown policies.
