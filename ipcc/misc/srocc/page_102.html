As food systems are assessed in relation to their contribution to global warming and/or to land degradation (e.g.,&#160;livestock systems) it is critical to evaluate their contribution to food security and livelihoods and to consider alternatives, especially for developing countries where food insecurity is prevalent (R&#246;&#246;s et al.&#160;2017; Salmon et al.&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="253.8" top="159.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 159.42; y1: 169.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="159.42" x1="253.8">1.2.1.5  Challenges arising from land governance</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="135.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.39; y0: 135.52; y1: 145.02; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="135.52" x1="307.6">Land-use change has both positive and negative effects: it can lead to economic growth, but it can become a&#160;source of tension and social unrest leading to elite capture, and competition (Haberl 2015). Competition for land plays out continuously among different use types (cropland, pastureland, forests, urban spaces, and conservation and protected lands) and between different users within the same land-use category (subsistence vs commercial farmers) (Dell&#8217;Angelo </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="303.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 303.54; y1: 313.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="303.54" x1="566.09">et al.&#160;2017b). Competition is mediated through economic and market forces (expressed through land rental and purchases, as well as trade and investments). In the context of such transactions, power relations often disfavour disadvantaged groups such as small-scale farmers, indigenous communities or women (Doss et al.&#160;2015; Ravnborg et al.&#160;2016). These drivers are in&#64258; uenced to a&#160;large degree by policies, institutions and governance structures. Land governance determines not only who can access the land, but also the role of land ownership (legal, formal, customary or collective) which in&#64258; uences land use, land-use change and the resulting land competition (Moroni 2018).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="171.55"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.87; y0: 171.55; y1: 181.05; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="171.55" x1="566.07">Globally, there is competition for land because it is a&#160;&#64257; nite resource and because most of the highly productive land is already exploited by humans (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011; Lambin 2012; Venter et al.&#160;2016). Driven by growing population, urbanisation, demand for food and energy,&#160;as well as land degradation, competition for land is expected to accentuate land scarcity in the future (Tilman et al.&#160;2011; Foley et al.&#160;2011; Lambin 2012; Popp et al.&#160;2016) (</span><span style="x0: 505.56; x1: 508.37; y0: 99.56; y1: 109.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="505.56" y0="99.56" x1="566.09">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 373.34; x1: 375.98; y0: 87.57; y1: 97.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="373.34" y0="87.57" x1="566.09">).
