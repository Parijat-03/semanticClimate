That is, it does not study adaptation policies or practices per se, but only the tools that can help inform adaptation strategies. Because this would require a significant design of the paper, I would suggest changing the title as opposed to doing too much to align with it. However, the paper could discuss the ways in which these tools serve to direct funds to certain kinds of adaptation projects.</p>
