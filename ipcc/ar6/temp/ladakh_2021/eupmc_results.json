Occurrences of these disasters have significantly influenced the development and vulnerability scenario of Trans-Himalayan Ladakh. Findings reveal that despite suffering losses from natural and human-induced disasters, the region has benefited by grabbing the attention of policymakers at the national level. Consequently, long-term developments were positively impacted, reflecting infrastructural upgradation, improved transportation and communication, profoundly improving the socio-economic well-being of the people. Furthermore, post-disaster developments have managed to showcase the unique physiography and adventurous terrains of Ladakh, promoting tourism as the main economic driver in the region. The exponential growth of tourism and associated sectors have influenced the vulnerability scenario, which was quantified using the multi-criterion-based analytical hierarchical processes (AHP) method, indicating an increase in climate change-related vulnerability, followed by socio-cultural, environmental, and physical vulnerabilities. Specifically, the vulnerabilities with respect to flash floods, landslides, erratic rainfall, haphazard constructions, cultural dilution, water crisis, and changes in land use patterns have been exacerbated across the study area. The study highlights the need for effective management of these emerging vulnerabilities through proper planning to ensure long-term sustainable development goals in this environmentally fragile region.", "affiliation": "Srinagar, 190006 India Department of Geography and Disaster Management, University of Kashmir.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"agency": "Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India", "orderIn": "0"}}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Disaster", "Tourism", "Vulnerability", "AHP method", "Trans-himalayas", "Kargil-Ladakh"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-023-00818-9"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9905771"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9905771?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2023-02-13", "firstIndexDate": "2023-02-14", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-02-10", "dateOfRevision": "2023-05-23", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-02-08", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-02-08"}, "PMC9474877": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "36104454", "source": "MED", "pmid": "36104454", "pmcid": "PMC9474877", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC9474877"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-18511-2", "title": "Drought characterization over Indian sub-continent using GRACE-based indices.", "authorString": "Rawat S, Ganapathy A, Agarwal A.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Rawat S", "firstName": "Shivam", "lastName": "Rawat", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Hydrology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, 247667, India."}}}, {"fullName": "Ganapathy A", "firstName": "Abinesh", "lastName": "Ganapathy", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0411-6791"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Hydrology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, 247667, India."}}}, {"fullName": "Agarwal A", "firstName": "Ankit", "lastName": "Agarwal", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8572-7046"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Hydrology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, 247667, India. ankit.agarwal@hy.iitr.ac.in."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8572-7046"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-0411-6791"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "12", "journalIssueId": "3415944", "dateOfPublication": "2022 Sep", "monthOfPublication": "9", "yearOfPublication": "2022", "printPublicationDate": "2022-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2022", "pageInfo": "15432", "abstractText": "Drought is a natural disaster affects water resources, agriculture, and social and economic development due to its long-term and frequent occurrence. It is crucial to characterize and monitor drought and its propagation to minimize the impact. However, spatiotemporal assessment of drought characteristics over India at the sub-basin scale based on terrestrial water storage is unexplored. In this study, the Terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) obtained from a Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and precipitation data are used to characterize the propagation of drought. Combined Climatological Deviation Index (CCDI) and GRACE-Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI) were computed as CCDI utilizes both precipitation and TWSA data while GRACE-DSI uses only TWSA data. Our results showed that GRACE-DSI exhibits significant negative trends over most of the Indian sub-basins compared to CCDI, indicating that most of the drought events are due to depletion of TWS. While other sub-basins show changing trends for GRACE-DSI and CCDI. The number of sub-basins showing significant negative trends for GRACE-DSI is more than that for CCDI. Hence TWS is depleting for most of the subbasins in India. Our results show that Indo-Gangetic plains face many drought events during 2002-2004, 2009-2014 &amp; 2015-2017. Maximum drought duration and drought severity obtained for the area of North Ladakh (not draining into Indus basins) by GRACE-DSI are 26\u00a0months (2002-2004) and -\u200944.2835, respectively. The maximum drought duration and drought severity obtained for the Shyok sub-basin by CCDI is 17\u00a0months (2013-2015) and -\u200913.4392, respectively.

While monsoons are constituents of many geographies, dynamics, materials and experiences, this paper focuses on the South Asian monsoon and its relationship with the Tibetan Plateau. In this region, freshwater resources are dependent on the monsoon; however, as rising global temperatures and rapid urban development significantly impact the behavior of the monsoon and the Plateau's ability to store freshwater, the monsoon-as a kinetic body of freshwater-becomes the focal point of visual media productions and extractive technologies that require a shifting of perspective from one that privileges land to one that centers the atmosphere.

Also, these states show the high death rate than other states. The positive COVID-19 cases are very drastically increased and death cases in these states due to the high population density. Hand hygiene, social distancing, and quarantine are some of the precautions that must be taken to prevent the virus from spreading in society. By increasing the detecting and testing capacity of the COVID-19 positive patients are also the way to enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.", "language": "eng",

a prime position in the treatment of infectious diseases. However, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has posed a serious threat to the effectiveness of antibiotics, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and escalation in healthcare costs causing a global health crisis. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in global healthcare setups have accelerated the development and spread of AMR, leading to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, which further limits treatment options. This creates a critical need to explore alternative approaches to combat bacterial infections. Phytochemicals have gained attention as a potential source of alternative medicine to address the challenge of AMR. Phytochemicals are structurally and functionally diverse and have multitarget antimicrobial effects, disrupting essential cellular activities. Given the promising results of plant-based antimicrobials, coupled with the slow discovery of novel antibiotics, it has become highly imperative to explore the vast repository of phytocompounds to overcome the looming catastrophe of AMR.

India produces 710 tonnes of biomedical waste daily. The contribution of COVID-19 related biomedical waste was 126 tonnes per day in first wave of the pandemic. BMW's rapid growth is putting a strain on current waste management facilities, especially in developing countries. A sudden boost in biomedical waste needs rapid and proper segregation and disposal methods to avoid future consequences.<h4>Main body of the abstract</h4>From literatures and statistical data available on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) it shows that India lags behind in large-scale sorting, collection, careful storage, transfer and disposal of bio waste. India has its own guidelines set by the CPCB to ensure the safe disposal of biomedical waste during diagnosis, treatment and quarantine of COVID-19 patients. Although there are strict guidelines for bio-waste management, many hospitals in the process of implementing them often dispose of waste in inappropriate, chaotic and indiscriminate ways due to negligence or laziness. Often, due to poor separation practices, hospital waste is mixed with general waste, resulting in harmful overall waste flow. Waste disposal handlers are not safe due to their exposure to various health risks and inadequate training in waste management. The present review sheds light on guidelines, measures, and challenges related to biomedical waste management.<h4>Short conclusion</h4>Improper waste separation leads to improper waste disposal. Waste generation and management issues are causing daily problems as they have a profound impact on the dramatically changing global environment, including air, water and soil pollution. In addition, BMW's daily production and its processing are inversely proportional. This situation suggests that India will soon be drowning in its own garbage.

They are examples of Larger benthic foraminifera (LBF), which are single-celled organisms with specific characteristic endoskeletons. Alveolinoids are found globally from the Cretaceous to the present day, and are important biostratigraphic index fossils in shallow-marine carbonates. They are often associated with hydrocarbon reservoirs, and exhibit provincialism with characteristic genera often confined to one of the American, Tethyan or Indo-Pacific provinces. Previously, the systematic study of the global interrelationship between the various alveolinoid lineages has not been possible because of the absence of biostratigraphic correlation between the geographically scattered assemblages, and the scarcity of described material from the Indo-Pacific province. Here we use the literature and new material from the Americas, the French Alps, Iran, Tibet, India and South East Asia, coupled with the use of the planktonic foraminiferal zonal (PZ) correlation scheme to propose a comprehensive, global, systematic analysis of the biostratigraphic, phylogenetic and paleogeographic evolution of the alveolinoids. The alveolinoids originated in the Cretaceous in the Tethyan province. During a global sea-level low stand, a westward migration of some alveolinoids species to the Americas occurred, a behaviour previously reported in contemporaneous orbitolinid LBF. After the Cretaceous/Palaeogene (K-P) event, which saw the extinction of all Cretaceous alveolinoids, rare new forms of alveolinoids evolved again, first in the Americas and later independently in Tethys. As was found in previous studies of rotalid LBF, sea-level low stands in the Paleocene also allowed some alveolinoid forms to migrate, but this time in an eastward direction from the Americas to Tethys, and from Tethys on to the Indo-Pacific province. Alveolinoids still exist today (<i>Borelis</i> and <i>Alveolinella</i>), the former of which is cosmopolitan, while the latter is restricted to the Indo-Pacific province. Throughout their phylogenetic history, alveolinoids characteristically exhibit convergent evolution, with the repeated re-occurrence of certain morphological features. Understanding this propensity to homoplasy is essential in understanding and constructing the phylogenetic relationships within the alveolinoid superfamily.", "affiliation": "Office of the

food, and ritual, and resource utilization is closely related to cultural diversity. Our study was conducted from June 2019 to April 2021, during which we aimed to document the local knowledge of plant resources of five ethnic groups, i.e., the Gujjar, Bakarwal, Kashmiri, Pahari, and Dogra communities of the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region, Western Himalayas. Through semi-structured interviews (N = 342) and group discussions (N = 38), we collected data on the ethnobotanical uses of plant resources. The data was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and ordination techniques (Principal Component Analysis) via, R software of version 4.0.0. Traditional uses were classified into three groups, i.e., single-, double-, and multi-use groups. The study recorded a total of 127 plant species, belonging to 113 genera and distributed among 64 botanical families. The dominant plant families were the Asteraceae, with 8% of all species, followed by Lamiaceae (6%), Polygonaceae (5%) and Ranunculaceae (4%). The recorded plant taxa were frequently used for medicine (51.4% responses), followed by food (14.9%), and fodder (9.5%). Principal component analysis (PCA) separated three groups of provisioning services depending on plant consumption preference levels. Comparative analysis showed remarkable similarities in plant uses (food, medicinal) among the Gujjar and Bakarwal ethnic groups, as both groups share a common culture. Some plants like <i>Azadirachta indica, Brassica campestris, Ulmus wallichiana, Amaranthus blitum</i>, and <i>Celtis australis</i> were also used for magico-religious purposes. We also recorded some medicinal uses that are new to the ethnobotanical literature of the J&K Himalayas, such as for <i>Betula utilis, Sambucus wightiana</i>, and <i>Dolomiaea macrocephala</i>, in our case for example local medicinal recipe, which is derived from <i>Dolomiaea macrocephala,</i> often known as <i>Nashasta</i>, used to treat weakness, back pain, and joint pain. Similarly, we also recorded new food uses for <i>Eremurus himalaicus</i>. Moreover, we also observed some plants for instance, <i>Fragaria nubicola, Betula utilis</i> and <i>Juniperus communis</i> have spiritual significance (i.e., amulets and scrolls) for this part of the Himalayan region.

A huge population base in rural India are rendered highly vulnerable to this drought because of their primary dependency on agriculture and in turn they may respond through temporary migration out of the drought affected rural areas in search of alternative livelihoods. This study aims to investigate the association between drought and temporary migration in rural India by fitting binary logistic regression models on a cross-sectional dataset involving both National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 64th round data and India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data. The paper also examines whether this association varies across the different socio-economic groups. Out of the total temporary migrants generated in rural India in the study period, 99.46% migrated internally and 67.12% were rural to urban migrants. The study finds that there is a positive association between drought instances and probability of a household to have at least one temporary migrant member in rural India (OR 1.64 with p<0.001) while controlling all other covariates. The study also concludes that the probability of temporary migration on account of drought is more severe among the socio-economically marginalised sections of the rural population compared to their better-off counterparts.", "affiliation": "Department of Policy and Management Studies, TERI School of Advanced Studies, New Delhi, NCT of Delhi, India.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"agency": "UGC NET JRF", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Family Characteristics"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Emigration and Immigration"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Transients and Migrants"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "India"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Droughts"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275449"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9683024"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9683024?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2022-10-11", "dateOfCreation": "2022-10-07", "firstIndexDate": "2022-10-08", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-11-28", "dateOfRevision": "2022-11-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-10-07", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-10-07"}, "PMC7980102": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "PMC7980102", "source": "PMC", "pmcid": "PMC7980102", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7980102"}, "title": "Obama, Trump and Indian foreign policy under Modi", "authorString": "Ganguly \u0160.", "authorList": {"author": {"fullName": "Ganguly \u0160", "firstName": "\u0160umit", "lastName": "Ganguly", "initials": "\u0160", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "107 S.

This deadly disease affected worldwide economically, hammering people lifestyle and also the environmental condition. After a few months, there is no vaccine to build the barricade between this virus and life. Many countries have tried to improve the methodology to control the disease and also the actual vaccine for coronavirus but not yet successful.

In between 116 days, the mortality rate is less in before lockdown (0.129%) and third phase lockdown is facing a huge mortality rate (43.496%).", "affiliation": "Department of Remote Sensing and GIS, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, India.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["India", "Mortality Rate", "Global Issues", "Lockdown", "Covid-19 Pandemic", "People Health"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-021-01118-3"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7838236"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7838236?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "2", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-02-02", "firstIndexDate": "2021-02-03", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-01-30", "dateOfRevision": "2022-07-16", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-01-27", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-01-27"}, "PMC8062074": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "33886656", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33886656", "pmcid": "PMC8062074", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8062074"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0250433", "title": "Temporal clustering of disorder events during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "authorString": "Campedelli GM, D'Orsogna MR.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Campedelli GM", "firstName": "Gian Maria", "lastName": "Campedelli", "initials": "GM", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7734-7956"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Sociology and Social Research, University of Trento, Trento, Italy."}}}, {"fullName": "D'Orsogna MR", "firstName": "Maria R", "lastName": "D'Orsogna", "initials": "MR", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, California State University, Northridge, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America."}]}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7734-7956"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["altmetrics", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "4", "volume": "16", "journalIssueId": "3143484", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "e0250433", "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed multiple public health, socio-economic, and institutional crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the \"COVID-19 Disorder Tracker\" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.", "affiliation":

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in December 2019 in China and has led to a global public health emergency. Previously, it was known as 2019-nCoV and caused disease mainly through respiratory pathways. The COVID-19 outbreak is ranked third globally as the most highly pathogenic disease of the twenty-first century, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic methodology have been demonstrated in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published regarding the integration of COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. Accordingly, this review systematically addresses environmental aspects of COVID-19 outbreak such as the origin of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic methodology, treatment options and technological advancement for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks. Finally, we integrate COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. We believe that this review will help to understand the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a multipurpose document, not only for the scientific community but also for global citizens. Countries should adopt emergency preparedness such as prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19 as the virus spreads rapidly globally.", "affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Sukanta Mahavidyalaya, University of North Bengal, Dhupguri 735210, West Bengal, India. samanta.palas2010@gmail.com.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["review-article", "Review", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Disease Outbreaks"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Epidemiological characteristics", "Public Health", "Emergency Preparedness", "Covid-19", "Sars-cov-2 Virus", "Environmental Perspectives"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i35.5822"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8475003"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8475003?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "2", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "gen"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2021-10-12", "dateOfCreation": "2021-10-11", "firstIndexDate": "2021-10-12", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-10-11", "dateOfRevision": "2021-10-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-09-01"}}}
