Since the exchange between John Dewey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1927</xref>) and Walter Lippmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1922</xref>) on this topic, scholars have sustained debate over the advantages and drawbacks of public influence in technical policy decisions for nearly a century (Eyal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Schudson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2006</xref>). Curiously, for all the analytical energy spent debating arguments for and against, sociologists have produced little empirical research describing cases of democratic or technocratic decision-making styles for complex technical problems. Moreover, literature on this topic glosses over the precise mechanisms through which the state makes decisions and implicitly assumes that governments can easily &#8216;turn a knob&#8217; to increase or decrease how technocratic or democratic their decision-making styles will be. In this context, key questions remain: How do governments attempt to implement participatory or technocratic decision-making styles, what are their effects, and what hurdles do they face?</p>
