journalism</italic> subtheme of <italic toggle="yes">support comments</italic>, there
were a handful of comments in the <italic toggle="yes">critical comments</italic> theme that
focused their criticism on journalists and the models they have developed. For
example, one commenter thinks that journalists <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;</italic>should be out
volunteering instead of complaining and whining [about rising cases due to the
virus].&#8221; Another commenter found &#8220;a remarkable lack of actual substance&#8221; in the
models and therefore decided to &#8220;tune them out as distraction.&#8221;</p>
