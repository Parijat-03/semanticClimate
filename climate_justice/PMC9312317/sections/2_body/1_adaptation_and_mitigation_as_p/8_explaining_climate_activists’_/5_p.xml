More precisely, it can be expected that differences in the relative importance attributed to adaptation compared to mitigation follow a more general fold line within the climate movement, namely between those who are willing to change society radically and at considerable cost to mitigate climate change and those with less outspoken views on the matter (Marquardt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; Garrelts and Dietz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>), who are less prepared to pay such costs, and who may be more prepared to accept the need to adapt to certain climate disruptions. In the case of FFF specifically, it has been found that some activists are willing to put climate action before economic growth, the will of the majority, and social security arrangements, while others are clearly more hesitant to accept such costs (Wahlstr&#246;m et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>; de Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020a</xref>). It is thus hypothesized that those belonging to the latter group will attribute greater weight to adaptation to address climate change. By the same token, those more supportive of far-reaching climate action will be less supportive towards a focus on adaptation, instead preferring a focus on mitigation.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par25"><italic>H2: A reluctance to support far-reaching climate action is related to greater support for climate adaptation.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
