      <td>to centuries, past climate states provide a wealth of insights. Data about these past states help to establish the\nrelationship between natural climate drivers and the history of changes in global temperature, global sea levels,\nthe carbon cycle, ocean circulation, and regional climate patterns, including climate extremes. Guided by such\ndata, scientists use Earth system models to identify the chain of events underlying the transitions between past\nclimatic states (FAQ 3.3). This is important because during present-day climate change, just as in past climate\nchanges, some aspects of the Earth system (e.g., surface temperature) respond to changes in greenhouse gases\non a time scale of decades to centuries, while others (e.g., sea level and the carbon cycle) respond over centuries\nto millennia (FAQ 5.3). In this way, past climate states serve as critical benchmarks for climate model simulations,\nimproving our understanding of the sequences, rates, and magnitude of future climate change over the next</td>

      <td>climate system evolve in response to warming. For example, one previous warm-climate state occurred roughly\n125,000 years ago, during the Last Interglacial period, when slight variations in the Earth&#8217;s orbit triggered\na sequence of changes that caused about 1&#176;C&#8211;2&#176;C of global warming and about 2&#8211;8 m of sea level rise relative\nto the 1850&#8211;1900, even though atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to 1850&#8211;1900 values\n(FAQ 1.3, Figure 1). Modelling studies highlight that increased summer heating in the higher latitudes of the\nNorthern Hemisphere during this time caused widespread melting of snow and ice, reducing the reflectivity of\nthe planet and increasing the absorption of solar energy by the Earth&#8217;s surface. This gave rise to global-scale\nwarming, which led in turn to further ice loss and sea level rise. These self-reinforcing positive feedback cycles are\na pervasive feature of Earth&#8217;s climate system, with clear implications for future climate change under continued\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In the case of sea level rise, these cycles evolved over several centuries to millennia,\nreminding us that the rates and magnitude of sea level rise in the 21st century are just a fraction of the sea level</td>

The fact that\nPliocene atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to the present, while global temperatures and\nsea levels were significantly higher, reflects the difference between an Earth system that has fully adjusted to\nchanges in natural drivers (the Pliocene) and one where greenhouse gases concentrations, temperature, and sea\nlevel rise are still increasing (present day). Much about the transition into the Pliocene climate state &#8211; in terms of\nkey causes, the role of cycles that hastened or slowed the transition, and the rate of change in climate indicators\nsuch as sea level &#8211; remain topics of intense study by climate researchers, using a combination of paleoclimate\nobservations and Earth system models. Insights from such studies may help to reduce the large uncertainties\naround estimates of global sea level rise by 2300, which range from 0.3 m to 3 m above 1850&#8211;1900 (in a low-\nemissions scenario) to as much as 16 m higher than 1850&#8211;1900 (in a very high-emissions scenario that includes</td>
