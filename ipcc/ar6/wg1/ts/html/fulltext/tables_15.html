      <td>Sea level and ice sheets. Although past and future global warming differ in their forcings, evidence from paleoclimate\nrecords and modelling show that ice-sheet mass and global mean sea level (GMSL) responded dynamically over multiple millennia\n(high confidence). This evidence helps to constrain estimates of the committed GMSL response to global warming (Box TS.4). For\nexample, under a past global warming levels of around [2.5&#176;C to 4&#176;C] relative to 1850&#8211;1900, like during the mid-Pliocene Warm\nPeriod, sea level was [5 to 25 m] higher than 1900 (medium confidence); under past global warming levels of [10&#176;C to 18&#176;C], like\nduring the Early Eocene, the planet was essentially ice free (high confidence). Constraints from these past warm periods, combined\nwith physical understanding, glaciology and modelling, indicate a committed long-term GMSL rise over 10,000 years, reaching about\n8 to 13 m for sustained peak global warming of 2&#176;C and up to 28 to 37 m for 5&#176;C, which exceeds the AR5 estimate. {2.3.3.3, 9.4.1.4,\n9.4.2.6, 9.6.2, 9.6.3.5}</td>

      <td>Ocean. Since AR5, better integration of paleo-oceanographic data with modelling along with higher-resolution analyses of\ntransient changes have improved understanding of long-term ocean processes. Low-latitude sea surface temperatures at the Last\nGlacial Maximum cooled more than previously inferred, resolving some inconsistencies noted in AR5. This paleo context supports\nthe assessment that ongoing increase in ocean heat content (OHC) represents a long-term commitment (see Core Concepts Box),\nessentially irreversible on human time scales (high confidence). Estimates of past global OHC variations generally track those of\nsea surface temperatures around Antarctica, underscoring the importance of Southern Ocean processes in regulating deep-ocean\ntemperatures. Paleoclimate data, along with other evidence of glacial&#8211;interglacial changes, show that Antarctic Circumpolar flow\nstrengthened and that ventilation of Antarctic Bottom Water accelerated during warming intervals, facilitating release of CO stored in\n2\nthe deep ocean to the atmosphere. Paleo evidence suggests significant reduction of deep-ocean ventilation associated with meltwater\ninput during times of peak warmth. {2.3.1.1, 2.3.3.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3.2}</td>

      <td>Carbon cycle. Past climate states were associated with substantial differences in the inventories of the various carbon reservoirs,\nincluding the atmosphere (Section TS.2.2). Since AR5, the quantification of carbon stocks has improved due to the development of\nnovel sedimentary proxies and stable-isotope analyses of air trapped in polar ice. Terrestrial carbon storage decreased markedly\nduring the Last Glacial Maximum by 300&#8211;600 PgC, possibly by 850 PgC when accounting for interactions with the lithosphere and\nocean sediments, a larger reduction than previously estimated, owing to a colder and drier climate. At the same time, the storage of\nremineralized carbon in the ocean interior increased by as much as 750&#8211;950 PgC, sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the\natmosphere (200 PgC) and terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined (high confidence). {5.1.2.2}</td>
