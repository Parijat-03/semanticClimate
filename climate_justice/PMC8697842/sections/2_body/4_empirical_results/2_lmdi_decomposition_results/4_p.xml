In 25 of 27 periods, the energy intensity factor reduced the emissions and this was a highly desirable outcome in terms of environmental sustainability. There were only two periods where the energy intensity increased the emissions, namely, 1991&#8211;1992 and 2010&#8211;2011. Australia&#8217;s total energy consumption increased by 44.5%, from 56,651 to 81,843 ktoe between 1990 and 2017 (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The impact of energy intensity on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was generally negative in the studied period. This result implies that the country used more energy efficient technologies and/or switched to less energy intensive industries year after year. Based on the findings of this study, one can conclude that the energy intensity effect was responsible for reducing an average of 6117.2 ktons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Australia, each year between 1990 and 2017. The cumulative share of the energy intensity factor was calculated as&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;119.2% for 2017. The cumulative increasing impact of real income effect was calculated as 158,851.4 ktons, whereas the reducing impact of energy intensity effect was computed as&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;165,163 ktons. Thus, it is possible to conclude that Australia&#8217;s energy intensity factor successfully compensated for the harmful impact of real income during the reviewed period.</p>
