<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0385">Building resilient food systems should be viewed as a dynamic, cross-sectoral concept rather than a static one. In general, the <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">IPCC (2012, p. 563)</xref> defines resilience as the &#8220;ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate, absorb or recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, including through ensuring the preservation, restoration or improvement of its essential basic structures and functions.&#8221; When considering the resilience of socio-ecological systems, which includes food systems, a central aspect to consider is the ability of the system to recover its functions and bounce back after a shock (e.g., <xref rid="bb0630" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2004</xref>), but this also needs to be closely linked to considerations of the capacity of the system to adapt or transform over time (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Folke et al., 2010</xref>), particularly where this may lead to more favorable outcomes in a world exposed to multiple shocks and long-term trends. Environmental tipping points may threaten food security and there is a need to further understand their interactions with socioeconomic characteristics of food systems (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">GFS, 2017</xref>). The risk of simultaneous breadbasket failures, arising from widespread adverse impacts on maize, wheat, and soybean, has been shown to increase profoundly with progressive levels of global warming and associated increases in the exposure to climatic extremes (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Gaupp et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
