Clinics need to support their communities, offering services to people in need, while also prioritising the safety of staff and students. In the case of the Monash Clinical Program, the response to COVID19 has been framed by extensive experience in developing and sustaining clinics that balance the dual objectives of student learning and client service. The response has sought to provide supervisors with a degree of flexibility while also providing effective structures to ensure continuity and consistency. Monash&#8217;s lengthy experience has provided those involved with the confidence to take appropriate chances and be creative in the design of remote activities. This has involved drawing on existing collaborations to inform new opportunities.</p>
