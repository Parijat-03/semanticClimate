<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Ultimately, we decided to let the different curators collect as they thought appropriate, not have a <sc>Swat</sc> team. After about a month, we took a look at what we had collected, and the answer was almost nothing. It turns out that collecting was really difficult. You can talk about it, but to really do it is challenging. With a traumatic event, the process becomes even more challenging. So, we put a couple of people on it, who pushed forward. In an event such as 9/11, where the act alone killed almost three thousand people, respect for those who died, respect for those who were injured, and respect for those who had to deal with death is important. How you approached people became part of the work. The ethics of collecting is something that we all worry about. But if you're a good collector, you have to be really driven. So, the people who were involved in the primary part of <sc>Nmah</sc> collecting were the better collectors in the museum, David Shayt and Bill Yiengst. And they used a network of friends. They were very driven. But it is about prying important and precious things from people and convincing them that they should give those items to the museum. And in the end, you have to think that you're doing the right thing.</p>
