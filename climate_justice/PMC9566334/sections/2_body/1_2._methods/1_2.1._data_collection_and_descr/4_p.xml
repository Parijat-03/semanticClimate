<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The SUHI intensity dataset only contained data for 191 of the 200 selected cities (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, of those 191 identified, not all census tracts were congruent with the SUHI boundary for each city; some of the tracts lie outside the boundary and no temperature data were available for them (cf: <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). If any pixel from the SUHI intensity dataset was within a census tract the tract was selected for the study. Of the 44,622 census tracts initially extracted, 44,476 tracts remained after accounting for this lack of overlap. These tracts include 48.11% of the total US population: 70.05% of the Black, 66.31% of the Hispanic, 78.80% of the Asian and 44.03% of the White population (as of 2020).</p>
