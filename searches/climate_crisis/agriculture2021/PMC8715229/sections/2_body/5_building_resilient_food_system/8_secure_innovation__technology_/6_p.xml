Beyond applications in medical research, advances in gene editing open up new avenues for agriculture and food systems (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>), including drought-resistant crop development and other options for growing crops on marginal and degraded lands. This ground-breaking scientific work should be considered in its potential in a world exposed to shifting climatic conditions and increasing climate extremes. <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Gao (2018)</xref> comments that advances in gene editing through the CRISPR Cas9 technology can help accelerate the plant breeding process, helping to diversify plant traits to adapt to demands of a rapidly growing world population and changing environment, increasing productivity as well as resilience, but also highlights the importance of a sound regulatory environment and transparency of information for engagement with the public.</p>
