      <td>In this box, the possible influences of the Arctic warming on the lower latitudes are assessed. This linkage was also the topic of Box 3.2\nof the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b). It is a topic that has been strongly\ndebated (Ogawa et al., 2018; K. Wang et al., 2018). Separate hypotheses have emerged for winter and summer that describe possible\nmechanisms of how the Arctic can influence the weather and climate at lower latitudes. They involve changes in the polar vortex,\nstorm tracks, jet stream, planetary waves, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and eddy-mean flow interactions, thereby affecting the\nmid-latitude atmospheric circulation, and the frequency, intensity, duration, seasonality and spatial extent of extremes and climatic\nimpact-drivers like cold spells, heatwaves, and floods (Cross-Chapter Box 10.1, Figure 1). However, we note that a decrease in the\nintensity of cold extremes has been observed in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in winter since 1950 (Section 11.3.2; van\nOldenborgh et al., 2019). Since SROCC, new literature has appeared, and the mechanisms and their criticisms are assessed here as an\nupdate and extension to the SROCC box.</td>

      <td>more meandering jet with Rossby waves of larger amplitude (Francis et al., 2017; Zhang and Luo, 2020). This may cause weather\nsystems to travel eastward more slowly and thus, all other things being equal, Arctic amplification could lead to more persistent\nweather patterns over the mid-latitudes (Francis and Vavrus, 2012). The persistent large meandering flow may increase the likelihood\nof connected patterns of temperature and precipitation climatic impact-drivers because they frequently occur when atmospheric\ncirculation patterns are persistent, which tends to occur with a strong meridional wind component. Another possible consequence of\nArctic warming is on the NAO/AO that shows a negative trend over the 1990s and early 2000s (Robson et al., 2016; Iles and Hegerl,\n2017), and has been linked to the reduction of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, and the increase in Eurasian snow cover (Cohen\net al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016). During negative NAO/AO the storm tracks shift equatorward and winters are\npredominantly more severe across northern Eurasia and the eastern United States, but relatively mild in the Arctic. This temperature\npattern is sometimes referred to as the &#8216;warm Arctic&#8211;cold continents (WACC)&#8217; pattern (Chen et al., 2018). However, L. Sun et al. (2016)\nnoticed that the WACC is a manifestation of natural variability. Enhanced sea ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea has also been related\nto a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex (Kretschmer et al., 2020) and its increased variability (Kretschmer et al., 2016) that\nwould induce a negative NAO/AO (Kim et al., 2014), the WACC pattern (Kim et al., 2014), and an increase in cold air outbreaks (CAO)\nin mid-latitudes (Kretschmer et al., 2018). Arctic warming might also increase Eurasian snow cover in autumn caused by the moister\nair that is advected into Eurasia from the Arctic with reduced sea ice cover (Cohen et al., 2014; Jaiser et al., 2016), although Peings\n(2019) suggests a possible influence of Ural blockings on both the autumn snow cover and the early winter polar stratosphere. The\ncirculation changes over the Ural-Siberian region are also suggested to provide a link between Barents-Kara sea ice and the NAO\n(Santolaria-Ot&#237;n et al., 2021).</td>

      <td>the recent period of Arctic warming (Coumou et al., 2015; Petrie et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016). Additional proposed consequences\nare a southward shift of the jet (Butler et al., 2010) and a double jet structure associated with an increase of the land&#8211;ocean thermal\ngradient at the coastal boundary (Coumou et al., 2018). It is hypothesized that weaker jets, diminished meridional temperature\ncontrast, and reduced baroclinicity might induce a larger amplitude in stationary wave response to stationary forcings (Zappa et al.,\n2011; Petoukhov et al., 2013; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015; Coumou et al., 2018; Mann et al., 2018; R. Zhang et al., 2020), and\nalso that a double jet structure would favour wave resonance (Kornhuber et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2017). Some studies suggest\nthat this is corroborated by an observed increase of quasi-stationary waves (Di Capua and Coumou, 2016; Vavrus et al., 2017;\nCoumou et al., 2018).</td>

However, the validity of some dynamical underlying mechanisms, such as a reduced meridional\ntemperature contrast inducing enhanced wave amplitude, has been questioned (Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Hoskins and Woollings,\n2015). On the contrary, the reduced meridional temperature contrast has been related to reduced meridional temperature advection\nand thereby reduced winter temperature variability (Collow et al., 2019).</td>
