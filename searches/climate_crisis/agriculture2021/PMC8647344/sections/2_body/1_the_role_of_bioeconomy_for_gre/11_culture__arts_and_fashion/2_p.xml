During the political discussions about the financial packages to recover pandemic-related economic losses, there is a sense that the cultural dimensions have not been taken into account or left behind. The acute reaction to operate remotely and &#8220;go virtual&#8221; the pandemic by promoting take away, distance learning, and digital environments led to the shutdown of arts performing and closing museums and restaurants. This transformation also concerns leisure time and entertainment (social media, gaming, etc.). The practice of spending more time online has, on the one hand, reduced the spread of the COVID-19, but on the other, has created a significant gap in real-world social interaction and allowed manipulation of public opinions via populism, &#8220;bubbles,&#8221; and fake news. These risks to social cohesion should be seriously considered and included in the overall planning to transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. People will have more green public spaces and increased opportunities to get involved with and inspired by nature. Culture, arts, and relevant social practices (e.g., rental, resale) could also support this transition by replacing material consumption, reducing exposure to fake news, and creatively promoting the bioeconomy wellbeing. Fashion brands have already set the pace by emphasizing sustainability and circularity (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">McKinsey and Company, 2020</xref>) e.g., using recycled (e.g., organic instead of regular cotton) and bio-based textiles that could lower and bio-based textiles that could lower GHG emissions.</p>
