Extension should build on this moment by devoting significant energy and resources to support a transition to community agriculture, prioritizing marginalized communities, and agroecological production for domestic consumption and local markets to feed the growing underclass. Such efforts have great potential to reduce poverty and inequality, increase food security, mitigate global warming, and provide a viable alternative to the corporate food regime, while building broad and diverse coalitions for transformational change.</p>
