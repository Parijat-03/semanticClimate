Within the report, Visvizi and Lytras [<xref rid="B9-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] gave a revealing background of future directions for smart village research. The editors pointed to a few research questions that future smart village research should strive to answer. One of these is: &#8220;How will smart and CSA research give account of, and conceptualize transformation and change in the smart village context?&#8221;(p. 8) [<xref rid="B9-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This question is what the current study modifies and seeks to answer. </p>
