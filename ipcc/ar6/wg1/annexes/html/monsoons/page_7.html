Associated with this regime, an upper-tropospheric anticyclone (the Bolivian High) forms over the Altiplano region during the monsoon onset (Lenters and Cook, 1997). The establishment of this upper-level anticyclone has been related to the transition from southerly to northerly winds and the occurrence of strong convective heating over the Amazon (Lenters and Cook, 1997; Wang and Fu, 2002). The SAmerM then retreats during austral autumn (March&#8211;April&#8211;May) with a&#160;north-eastward migration of the convection (e.g.,&#160;Vera et&#160;al., 2006).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="510.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="510.6" x1="304.76">The SAmerM displays considerable variability on time scales raging from intra-seasonal to decadal (Vera et&#160;al., 2006; Marengo et&#160;al., 2012; Vuille et&#160;al., 2012; Novello et&#160;al., 2017). The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO, Section AIV.2.8) influences the SACZ via changes in mid-latitude synoptic disturbances (Jones and Carvalho, 2002; Liebmann et&#160;al., 2004). At interannual time scales, ENSO explains most of the SAmerM variability (e.g.,&#160;Paegle and Mo, 2002; Marengo et&#160;al., 2012). Tropical Atlantic temperatures also affect the SAmerM, with reduced atmospheric moisture transport to feed the monsoon under warmer tropical North Atlantic conditions (e.g.,&#160;Marengo et&#160;al., 2008; Zeng et&#160;al., 2008). In addition to SSTs, interannual variability of the SAmerM is linked to changes in land surface processes, cold-air incursions, the latitudinal location of the subtropical jet, and the Southern Annular Mode (Section AIV.2.2; e.g.,&#160;Silvestri and Vera, 2003; Li and Fu, 2004; Collini et&#160;al., 2008; Yin et&#160;al., 2014). At inter-decadal time scales, the SAmerM is influenced by important modes of climate variability (e.g.,&#160;Robertson and Mechoso, 2000; Paegle and Mo, 2002; Chiessi et&#160;al., 2009; Silvestri and Vera, 2009).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="282.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="282.6" x1="304.77">The general large-scale features of the SAmerM are reasonably well simulated by coupled climate models although they do not adequately reproduce maximum precipitation over the core of the monsoon, even when considering simulations under past natural forcings, such as those during the last millennium (Rojas et&#160;al., 2016; D&#237;az and Vera, 2018). However, CMIP5 models featured an improved representation of the SAmerM with respect to CMIP3 (Joetzjer et&#160;al., 2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; D&#237;az and Vera, 2017). </span></div><div left="56.69" right="271.72" top="162.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="162.6" x1="271.72">The SAmerM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.5 and 8.4.2.4.5.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="282.5" top="126.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.8; y0: 126.48; y1: 136.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: YIELBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="126.48" x1="282.5">AV.4.6 The Australian-Maritime Continent Monsoon</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="102.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="102.6" x1="304.75">The Australian-Maritime Continent monsoon (AusMCM) occurs during austral summer (December&#8211;January&#8211;February), with the large-scale shift of the ITCZ into the Southern Hemisphere.

Over northern Australia, the monsoon season generally lasts from December to March and is associated with the west to north-westerly inflow of moist winds, producing convection and heavy precipitation. Over the Maritime Continent, the main rainy season south of the equator is centred on December to February with north-westerly monsoon flow at low levels.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="522.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="522.6" x1="563.24">Over Australia, the monsoon is strongly influenced by ENSO on interannual time scales: during El Ni&#241;o years the monsoon onset tends to be delayed (Nicholls et&#160;al., 1982; McBride and Nicholls, 1983; Drosdowsky, 1996). This relationship breaks down after the onset of the wet season, leading to little correlation between ENSO phase and total monsoon rainfall or duration (e.g.,&#160;Hendon et&#160;al., 2012). The Maritime Continent also experiences a&#160;delay in monsoon onset during El Ni&#241;o years and monsoon rainfall is correlated with ENSO during the dry and transition seasons (Robertson et&#160;al., 2011). The AusMCM is also influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (peaking in September to November) that tends to weaken the following monsoon when in its positive phase (Cai et&#160;al., 2005).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="366.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 366.6; y1: 376.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="366.6" x1="563.26">The ability of climate models to simulate the Australian monsoon has improved in successive generations of coupled models (i.e., from CMIP3 to CMIP6, Moise et&#160;al., 2012; Brown et&#160;al., 2016; Narsey et&#160;al., 2020), with sensitivity of monsoon rainfall to the magnitude of SST biases in the Equatorial Pacific (Brown et&#160;al., 2016). </span></div><div left="315.21" right="532.19" top="294.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="294.6" x1="532.19">The AusMCM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.6 and 8.4.2.4.6.</span></div></body></html>
