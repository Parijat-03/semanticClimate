Activities supported by the JTF should respect EU climate standards and &#8216;do no significant harm&#8217; according to the taxonomy regulation (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021b</xref>, recital 6). All &#8216;finance partners&#8217; under the public sector loan facility (i.e. the EIB and other participating institutions) should use the taxonomy and follow its &#8216;do no significant harm&#8217; principle (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2021c</xref>, recital 7). The facility&#8217;s contribution to the taxonomy&#8217;s environmental objectives will also be assessed (Ibid, art. 17.2). The &#8216;environmental, climate or social impact&#8217; of support under InvestEU will be assessed according to Commission guidance which &#8216;should appropriately use&#8217; the taxonomy criteria (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021a</xref>, recital 13). This Commission &#8216;sustainability guidance&#8217; will however go beyond the taxonomy&#8217;s environmental and &#8216;no significant harm&#8217; standards to include an explicitly social dimension: &#8216;estimating the social impact of projects, including on gender equality, on the social inclusion of certain areas or populations and on the economic development of areas and sectors affected by structural challenges such as the need to decarbonise the economy&#8217; (Ibid, art. 8.6).</p>
