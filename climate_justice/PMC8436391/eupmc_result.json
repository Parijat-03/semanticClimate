As social work and community development educators\nin Ireland and Australia, the question becomes how can we respond in a time of major\n\u2018disruption\u2019 where there are both opportunities and constraints? This paper\nsettles on this pause and uncertainty to seek new approaches to prepare social work students\nfor changing conditions. Long-standing questions re-surface in relation to social, economic,\npolitical and environmental structures and conditions that are located in a neoliberal\nframework. The paper explores challenges and opportunities facing educators and social work\nstudents through a core set of principles\u2014critical, relational and connected\u2014that\nunderpin our community development pedagogy. Within these themes, we explore teaching practices\nwhich seek to create a \u2018Community of Learners\u2019, generate a process of\ncollaborative critical inquiry, engage students in reflective praxis enriched by contemporary\ntheory and research, and foster a deep, connected and adaptive perspective on global and local\nissues. This stimulates creativity and meets the need for critical and adaptable practitioners\ncapable of practical action through this period of disruption and crises of governance, climate\nand technologies of the future.", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Undetermined", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436391/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436391/pdf/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8436391"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8436391?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-09-16", "firstIndexDate": "2021-09-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-09-16", "dateOfRevision": "2021-09-16", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-08-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-08-03"}
