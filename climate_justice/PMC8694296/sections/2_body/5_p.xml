Perhaps it is a function of the fact that many who hold political power will not be around to face the future that a 2.0&#176;C-warmer world promises. In contrast, youth are very engaged and vocal in their demands for action for climate justice&#8212;it is their lives and their opportunities that are most threatened. Giulia Gasparri et al., in their paper &#8220;Children, Adolescents, and Youth Pioneering a Human Rights-Based Approach to Climate Change,&#8221; draw on the authors&#8217; own experiences in the youth activist space to show the many ways in which youth are operationalizing rights-based responses to climate change. These rights-based approaches include a demand for young people&#8217;s participation and inclusion in the global and local arenas where decisions on climate action are made. Not surprisingly, youth were present at COP26 but, like the rest of civil society, not in the negotiating rooms, and they were frustrated with the outcomes. The paper also describes young people&#8217;s focus on equality and nondiscrimination and their heightened awareness of climate change impacts on vulnerable and marginalized populations. The authors explain that young people are driving climate accountability through formal contributions to legislative and judicial processes and by engaging international human rights mechanisms.</p>
