Whilst the medium provides a viable means of disseminating information to the citizenry, many people hide behind the anonymity it offered to perpetuate the evil of misinformation (Obi-Ani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). The poor coverage and most probably the paucity of public education campaigns gave room for the spread of disinformation making the disease more difficult to curtail. Olatunji et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>) showed that COVID-19 conspiracy theories were driven majorly by social media, a dearth of trust in political leadership and the sensationalisation of inaccurate COVID-19 news by traditional media. Other studies showed that news media reporting lacked in-depth coverage, they are often alarming and panic-inducing reporting and public sensitisation and education were sparingly captured (Apuke and Omar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>).</p>
