The capabilitarian argument against the Moral Equivalence Thesis, as presented here, does not reject the thesis. Rather, it shows that the acceptance of the Moral Equivalence Thesis depends on the prior acceptance of some version of the equality of resources view as the appropriate theory of distributive justice. If, instead, we endorse a capabilitarian theory of distributive justice, it is conceivable that a normative theory can be developed that does not endorse the Moral Equivalence Thesis. The full development of such a theory&#8212;and especially its justification&#8212;is beyond the scope of this paper. The more limited aim here has been to pave the way to showing how, within distributive justice, one can resist the Moral Equivalence Thesis by changing the metric of distributive justice and by conceptualizing procreative parenting not as a preference but as a valuable capability.</p>
