The NDVI is a robust indicator that is readily calculable from multispectral imagery [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been used in prior environmental exposure studies as a proxy for the distribution of urban greenspace [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and as an indicator of vegetation abundance in the analysis of green biomass and urban greenspace [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A separate analysis of NDVI became useful in the case of Delhi due to the specific geography of greenspace here, consisting of forested and riverine areas in the central and eastern parts, and agricultural land uses in the urban peripheries to the north and west.</p>
