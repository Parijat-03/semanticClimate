<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par14">The three levels of entities and norms are both intra-related (inside one level) and inter-related (between two different levels). We focused largely on inter-level relations and their dynamical properties. Focusing on the relationships between different levels allowed for the emergence of dynamical features related to conceptions of change in the three texts. Thus, entities and respective norms were analyzed with respect to their dynamical effects on other levels within the system. In the course of our analysis, we identified a specific fraction of these relations and the meso-level as the normative core and the focus of action and interventions.</p>
