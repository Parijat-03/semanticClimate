And then the COVID-19 pandemic happened. We're not collecting anything related to COVID-19 right now because, again, the collection revolves around the physicians and what they are using to treat the coronavirus. We also want to pivot toward patient interaction not just physician interaction. We are definitely thinking about community outreach to effectively and responsibly collect (not just material surrounding COVID-19 but also around the protests).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref></sup></p>
