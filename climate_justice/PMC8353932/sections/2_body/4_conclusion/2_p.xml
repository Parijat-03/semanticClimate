The IPCC thus is politically responsible not only for having helped enact the discourse of scarcity but also for cultivating a new discourse of emancipation to attenuate the risk of the scarcity mindset. However, the long-standing dominance of positivist disciplines&#8212;such as natural sciences and economics&#8212;in the IPCC&#8217;s knowledge assessment has marginalised the role of interpretative social sciences and the humanities (Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). To foster an emancipatory narrative, the IPCC should engage in more meaningful ways with these interpretative disciplines.</p>
