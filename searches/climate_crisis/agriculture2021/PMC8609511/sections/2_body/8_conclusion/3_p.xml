The pandemic has highlighted major differences in the way agricultural policies are implemented over the decades. It effectively reversed the importance of self-reliance for food production and the pitfalls of the free trade system. In India, small-scale farmers are not rooted in large agricultural enterprises or corporate farms but are related to the issue of agricultural transformation and the role of the state in agricultural policy. After locking, these suspicions must be forced into the policy table. This prospect depends on whether the political economy of decision-making is favorable. Certainly, the expectation that the orthodoxy of economic theory will easily give way to a more idiosyncratic understanding of our economy and society is a very high requirement. At the other end of the blockade is a struggle that has not yet been carried out. The ending of the lockdown is not going to stop the issues. Instead, the issues will be exacerbated at the beginning of the new agricultural sowing season. There is a great need for Government help and activeness to implement each and every laws in the sector and also to assist in the agricultural inputs. The absence of any aid would only intensify the agricultural crisis. The need for an hour is to optimize agricultural possibilities, which in difficult times have shown their utility and resilience.</p>
