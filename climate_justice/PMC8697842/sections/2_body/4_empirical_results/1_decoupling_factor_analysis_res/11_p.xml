Decoupling was more frequent between ecological footprint and population than between CO<sub>2</sub> and population. On the other hand, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrates an upward trend in the decoupling factor values between Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and population. However, the decoupling factor values followed a relatively constant trend between the country&#8217;s ecological footprint and population. The decoupling factor results of ecological footprint and its two determinants are also showed in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.</p>
