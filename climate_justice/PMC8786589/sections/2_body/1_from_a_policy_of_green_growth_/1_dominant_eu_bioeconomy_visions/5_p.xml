The revised EU bioeconomy strategy responded to these critiques in several ways. First, it diversifies the challenges at hand, which now include finite biological resources and planetary boundaries, climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and deforestation. Second, it highlights sustainability as the key principle, adopting the term &#8216;sustainable bioeconomy&#8217;. Looking beyond introductory sections and into policy measures and actions, however, sustainability is reduced to economic sustainability only, where green economic growth and green jobs have a key role. Third, locally sourced bioeconomy is encouraged, but policy measures and actions are limited to assessment, measuring, monitoring and only voluntary actions. Fourth, the solutions remain limited to technoscientific solutions, where modernised industries and green jobs for innovative production and consumption, including cascading and circular use of materials and energy, dominate. Fifth and final, the green growth and the EU global competitiveness and prosperity of its citizens are highlighted or framed as ultimate goals.</p>
