With this goal, this paper substantiates three claims: (i) that inadequate adaptation finance is due to the inefficacy of market instruments and its territorial framing, that looks at adaptation only as a local or national public good; (ii) that it makes conceptual and political sense to consider adaptation as a GPG; and (iii) that framing adaptation as a GPG would make a difference by boosting public finance. What follows are three sections on the three claims, with a conclusion.</p>
