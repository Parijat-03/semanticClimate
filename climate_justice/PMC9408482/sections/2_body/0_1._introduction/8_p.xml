<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To the best of the author&#8217;s knowledge, this article is the first of its type that studies NDC submissions and provides an analytical model of needs grounded in the writing excerpts of NDCs. This framework offers a starting point for research on different needs components and their relationships defined in it. It also formulates an operational scheme to assist the UNFCCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and climate action (Goal 13 of the SDGs) related stakeholders at the national, regional, and international levels to reflect on the spectrum of NDC implementation conditions of the LDPCs. It also assists the least developed countries in updating their NDC submissions and reporting on the status of implementation in a systematic way. It can further assist the upcoming COP27 with policymaking on the LDPCs.</p>
