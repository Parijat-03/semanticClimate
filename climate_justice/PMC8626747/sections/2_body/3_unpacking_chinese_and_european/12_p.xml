In the case of meat and leather, both China and EU are exposed to consumption linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado: more than half of the slaughterhouses that supply China and at least 20% of soy exports and 17% of meat exports to the EU come from land use illicit changes (MacFarquhar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>; Raj&#227;o et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). Intensive soybean cultivation in the Amazon and Cerrado has created huge production holes within the landscapes of these biomes. Thanks to the agricultural frontier&#8217;s pressure, it has also increased GHG emissions, local social conflicts and impacts on food and water security.</p>
