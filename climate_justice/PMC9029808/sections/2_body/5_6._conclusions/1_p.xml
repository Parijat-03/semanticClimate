<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Today, we stand at a critical juncture, with less than a decade left to revert the current scientific trajectory [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recognizing that the least climate-resilient population groups and most affected communities across the globe are already facing catastrophic environmental, health, social, political, and economic losses due to climate change, there is no more time to delay action. Understanding the potential and track record of youth in addressing cross-cutting issues of human rights and health equity within climate discourse and legal action, we need to develop and support youth-led public health and human rights approaches to climate action to address the multidimensional threats of the climate crisis. Based on the work undertaken by young people across the world, this paper has brought forward three recommendations for scholars and practitioners to adopt a more holistic understanding of, and responses to, the climate crisis in order to build a sustainable, equitable, and resilient future. Undertaking such recommendations will help protect people&#8217;s health, reduce future health costs and safeguard human rights, ensure that policies take advantage of multisectoral co-benefits, reinforce proactive youth and civil society leadership, recognize the voices and needs of the most affected people and communities, and increase awareness on the multidimensional impacts of climate change among the public to push for greater government accountability and effective action.</p>
