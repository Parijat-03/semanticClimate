They emphasise the urgent need for effective planetary stewardship to maintain the stability of the Earth System and prevent the crossing of a threshold that will irreversibly lead to a dangerously hot planet. This sentiment of climate scientists resonates with the outcry from a new generation of youth climate movement where the phrase &#8216;follow the science&#8217; is commonplace (Evensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>). What is alluded to in such trope is a deviation of the government&#8217;s political actions from the IPCC&#8217;s scientific advice. In the eyes of youth climate activists, the role of politics is relegated to simply following the <italic>de facto</italic> decisions made by science. Under scarcity, there appears no room for political fudging.</p>
