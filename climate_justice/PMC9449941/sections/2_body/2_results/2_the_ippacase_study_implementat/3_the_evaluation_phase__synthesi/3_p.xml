The aim was to specify relevant indications for the case study on urban transport across the multidimensional socio-technical systems categories from the individual impact studies. While relevant impact results were identified by hands of a survey among project groups, the assignment to categories and criteria was done by document analysis and bilateral conversations with the research teams.
