During the first wave of <italic toggle="yes">urban optimism</italic>, the primary focus of most of the research was to understand why city mayors, local leaders, and officials were voluntarily choosing to pick up the responsibility for climate mitigation and adaptation within their domain of operation. This body of academic work explored political motivations for climate action at the city level, often with reference to opportunities for co&#8208;benefits (Heinrichs, Krellenberg, &amp; Fragkias, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0147" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Koehn, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0175" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), bundled development possibilities (Aggarwal, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the presence of political leadership (champions, policy entrepreneurs) (Bassett &amp; Shandas, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Carmin, Anguelovski, &amp; Roberts, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0081" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lassa &amp; Nugraha, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0181" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pasquini, Ziervogel, Cowling, &amp; Shearing, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0223" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and the potential for broader political buy&#8208;in (Pasquini &amp; Shearing, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0222" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
