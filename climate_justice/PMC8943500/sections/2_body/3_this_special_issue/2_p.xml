The articles are presented following their themes. The studies are motivated by the task set with the United Nations&#8217; Sustainable Development Goals and UNESCO&#8217;s Education 2030 Agenda, which understands that children may learn and develop competencies on sustainability, be agents of change, and actively contribute to sustainable development.</p>
