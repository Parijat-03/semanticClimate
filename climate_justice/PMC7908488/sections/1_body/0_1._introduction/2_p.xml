<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It has long been known that the paved surfaces of urban areas will absorb and retain solar radiation, increasing urban temperatures [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For this reason, cities in temperate climates will often have higher temperatures than vegetated surrounding countrysides, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Dryland cities as well as tropical cities also experience this phenomena [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Likewise, particular neighborhoods with high levels of paved surfaces may be hotter than others with more vegetation.</p>
