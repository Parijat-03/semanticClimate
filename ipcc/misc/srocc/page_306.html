There is no clear trend in precipitation extremes, with some potential for moderate rise in occurrence of droughts. The diminution of glaciers is projected to continue in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges, a&#160;major source of surface waters along with seasonal snowmelt. Glacier melting will increase the hazards from moraine-dammed glacial lakes and spring &#64258;oods (Reyer et al. 2017). Increased intensity of spring &#64258;oods creates favourable conditions for higher soil erosion by water, especially in the sloping areas in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The continuation of some of the current unsustainable cropland and rangeland management practices may lead to elevated rates of soil erosion, particularly in those parts of the region where climate change projections point to increases in &#64258;oods (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) or increases in droughts (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) (Hijioka et al. 2014). Increasing water use to compensate for higher evapotranspiration due to rising temperatures and heat waves could increase soil erosion by water in the irrigated zones, especially in sloping areas and crop &#64257;elds with uneven land levelling (Bekchanov et al. 2010). The desiccation of the Aral Sea resulted in a&#160;hotter and drier regional microclimate, adding to the growing wind erosion in adjacent deltaic areas and deserts (Kust 1999). </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="447.56" x1="307.29">There are numerous sustainable land and water management  practices available in the region for reducing soil erosion (Abdullaev et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2009; Kust et al. 2014; Nurbekov et al. 2016). These include: improved land levelling and more ef&#64257;cient irrigation methods such as drip, sprinkler and alternate furrow irrigation (Gupta et al. 2009); conservation agriculture practices, including no-till methods and maintenance of crop residues as mulch in the rainfed and irrigated areas (Kienzler et al. 2012; Pulatov et al. 2012); rotational grazing; institutional arrangements for pooling livestock for long-distance mobile grazing; reconstruction of watering infrastructure along the livestock migratory routes (Han et al. 2016; Mirzabaev et al. 2016); afforesting degraded marginal lands (Djanibekov and Khamzina 2016; Khamzina et al. 2009; Khamzina et al. 2016); integrated water resource management (Dukhovny et al. 2013; Kazbekov et al. 2009); and planting salt&#160;&#8211; and drought-tolerant halophytic plants as windbreaks in sandy rangelands (Akinshina et al. 2016; Qadir et al. 2009; Toderich et al. 2009; Toderich et al. 2008), and potentially the dried seabed of the former Aral Sea (Breckle 2013).

Over the past several centuries, more than 60% of the areas in arid and semi-arid regions were used as pastoral and agricultural lands. The coupled impacts of past climate change and human activity have caused deserti&#64257;cation and dust storms to become a&#160;serious problem in the region (Xu et al. 2010). In 1958, the Chinese government recognised that deserti&#64257;cation and dust storms jeopardised the livelihoods of nearly 200&#160;million people, and afforestation programmes for combating deserti&#64257;cation have been initiated since 1978. China is committed to go beyond the Land Degradation Neutrality objective, as indicated by the following programmes that have been implemented. The Chinese Government began the Three North&#8217;s Forest Shelterbelt programme in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China, with the goal to combat deserti&#64257;cation and to control dust storms by improving forest cover in arid and semi-arid regions. The project is implemented in three stages (1978&#8211;2000, 2001&#8211;2020 and 2021&#8211;2050). In addition, the Chinese government launched the Beijing and Tianjin Sandstorm Source Treatment Project (2001&#8211;2010), Returning Farmlands to Forest Project (2003&#8211;present), and the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project (2003&#8211;present) to combat deserti&#64257;cation, and for adaptation and mitigation of climate change (State Forestry Administration of China 2015; Wang 2014; Wang et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.82" top="255.55"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 321.98; y0: 255.55; y1: 265.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="255.55" x1="565.82">The results of the &#64257;fth monitoring period (2010&#8211;2014) showed: (i) compared with 2009, the area of degraded land decreased by 12,120 km</span><span style="x0: 355.91; x1: 359.1; y0: 235.44; y1: 242.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="355.91" y0="235.44" x1="360.7">2 </span><span style="x0: 360.5; x1: 365.07; y0: 231.52; y1: 241.02; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="360.5" y0="231.52" x1="565.81">over a&#160;&#64257;ve-year period; (ii) in 2014, the average coverage of vegetation in the sand area was 18.33%, an increase of&#160;0.7% compared with 17.63% in 2009, and the carbon sequestration increased by&#160;8.5%; (iii) compared with 2009, the amount of wind erosion decreased by 33%, the average annual occurrence of sandstorms decreased by 20.3% in 2014; (iv) as of 2014, 203,700&#160;km</span><span style="x0: 560.34; x1: 563.53; y0: 175.44; y1: 182.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="560.34" y0="175.44" x1="563.53">2</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="159.53"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.34; y0: 159.53; y1: 169.03; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="159.53" x1="565.81">of degraded land were effectively managed, accounting for 38.4% of the 530,000 km</span><span style="x0: 373.28; x1: 376.47; y0: 151.44; y1: 158.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="373.28" y0="151.44" x1="376.47">2</span><span style="x0: 378.07; x1: 382.65; y0: 147.52; y1: 157.02; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="378.07" y0="147.52" x1="565.82">of manageable deserti&#64257;ed land; (v) the restoration of degraded land has created an annual output of 53.63 Mt of fresh and dried fruits, accounting for 33.9% of the total national annual output of fresh and dried fruits (State Forestry Administration of China 2015).
