At the same time, resulting changes in material consumption may significantly impact manufacturing and, in turn, employment in associated industrial sectors. Strictly formalised modelling frameworks alone are insufficient to delve into such impacts, and this is where quantitative evidence can be qualitatively supported, for example via sparking the imagination of &#8220;what if&#8221; scenarios <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>.</p>
