We track the link between temperature anomaly, drought, and food insecurity, using a relatively new dataset collected by FAO since 2014, that focuses on people&#8217;s lived experiences of food insecurity, such as whether they had to skip meals, worried about not having enough to eat, or were not able to eat healthy and nutritious meals. We provide quantitative evidence that climate change, proxied by temperature anomaly and drought, is already having a negative impact on food security across the four regions of Africa, Americas, Asia, and Europe. Our findings are consistent with the literature that focuses on the links between climate change and food production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Importantly, we additionally find that the impact of the temperature anomaly on food insecurity is increasing over time, as average temperatures increase. Though this pattern is particularly pronounced for moderate to severe food insecurity, a similar pattern can be found for severe food insecurity. Because we focus on food security rather than food production, our findings have particular relevance for economic development and poverty reduction more broadly.</p>
