These range from annual to multi-decadal 2 averages required to characterise low-frequency variability and trends in climate to hourly or instantaneous 3 maximum or minimum values of impactful climate variables. In between, information on seasonal averages 4 of rainfall for example is important to define averaging periods whose relevance are geographically-5 dependent. As a result, the Atlas presents results over a wide range of timescales and averaging periods with 6 the Interactive Atlas allowing a choice of user-defined seasons and a range of predefined daily to multi-day 7 climate indices. 8 9 10 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 646.25; y1: 657.23; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="646.25" x1="282.94">Atlas.2.2 Spatial domains and scales of analysis </span><span x0="27.66" y0="646.25" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 646.25; y1: 657.23; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">11 12 Many factors influence the spatial domains and scales over which climate information can be reliably 13 generated and is required. Despite all efforts in researching, analysing and understanding climate change, a 14 key factor in the spatial scales at which analysis can be undertaken is directly related to the availability and 15 reliability of data, both observational and from model simulations. In addition, information is required over a 16 wide range of spatial domains defined either from a climatological or geographical perspective (e.g., a region 17 affected by monsoon rainfall or a river basin) or from a socio-economic or political perspective (e.g., least-18 developed countries or nation states). Chapter 1 provides an overview of these topics (see Section 1.5.2). 19 This subsection discusses some relevant issues, summarizes recent advances in defining domains and spatial 20 scales used by AR6 analyses and how these can be explored with the Interactive Atlas. 21 22 Recent IPCC reports &#8211; AR5 Chapter 14 (IPCC, 2013b) and SR1.5 Chapter 3 (IPCC, 2018a) &#8211; have 23 summarized information on projected future climate changes over subcontinental regions defined in the 24 IPCC SREX report and later extended in the AR5 from the 26 regions in SREX to include the polar, 25 Caribbean, two Indian Ocean, and three Pacific Ocean regions (hereafter known as the AR5 WGI reference 26 regions) (Figure Atlas.2:a). In recent literature, new subregions have been used, for example for North and 27 South America, Africa and Central America, together with the new definition of reference oceanic regions 28 (Iturbide et al., submitted). As a result, an updated version of the reference regions has been considered for 29 AR6 (hereafter known as AR6 WGI reference regions) and is shown in Figure Atlas.2:b. The goal of these 30 subsequent revisions was to improve the climatic consistency of the regions so they represented sub-31 continental areas of greater climatic coherency. 32 33 34 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 341.69; y1: 352.67; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="341.69" x1="210.41">[START Figure Atlas.2: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="341.69" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 341.69; y1: 352.67; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">35 36 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 317.6; y1: 327.62; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="317.6" x1="123.38">Figure Atlas.2: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="317.6" x1="539.25" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 134.3; y0: 317.6; y1: 327.62; width: 6.68; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Reference AR5 (a) and AR6 (b) WGI regions (Iturbide et al., submitted).

(submitted) for the definition of the reference regions was guided by 45 two basic principles: 1) climatic consistency and better representation of regional climate features and 2) 46 representativeness of model results (i.e., sufficient number of model grid boxes). The finer resolution of 47 CMIP6 models (as compared to CMIP5) yields better model representation of the reference regions allowing 48 them to be revised for better climatic consistency (e.g., dividing heterogeneous regions) while preserving the 49 model representation. Figure Atlas.3: illustrates this issue displaying the number of (land) grid boxes in each 50 of the AR6 and AR5 reference regions for two reference grid horizontal resolutions of 1&#176; and 2&#176;, 51 representative of the typical resolution of CMIP6 and CMIP5 models, respectively. This figure shows that 52 the new reference regions are better suited for the assessment of model results due to the improvement in 53 model resolution, with a minimum model coverage for the New Zealand (NZ), the Caribbean (CAR) and 54 Southern South America (SSA) regions with only 20-40 land grid boxes. 55 </span></div></body></html>
