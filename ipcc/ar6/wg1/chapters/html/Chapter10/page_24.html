As&#160;an example, Lin and Huybers (2019) found that changes in the number of rain gauges after 1975 resulted in spurious trends in extremes of Indian rainfall in a&#160;0.25&#176; gridded dataset spanning the 20th&#160;century. In fact, the number of stations used to construct the&#160;gridded dataset dropped by half after 1990, leading to inhomogeneity and spurious trends (Section&#160;10.6.3). Over the southern part of the Mediterranean, which is an area sparsely covered by meteorological stations, data scarcity can lead to large uncertainties in the different gridded datasets and strongly affect model evaluation (Section&#160;10.6.4). Satellite observations can compensate the ground-based precipitation radar data sparsity to prevent an oversight of significant climate change signals (Yokoyama et al., 2019).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.77" top="546.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="546.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There are techniques for estimating and reconstructing missing data. The methods depend on the variable of interest, the temporal resolution (e.g.,&#160;daily or monthly), and the type of climate (wet or dry), among others. There has been very little evaluation of the performance of classical and data mining methods (e.g.,&#160;Sattari et&#160;al., 2017). The classical methods include the arithmetic mean, inverse distance weighting method, multiple regression analysis, multiple imputation, and single best estimator, while the data-mining methods include multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, support vector machine, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, gene expression programming method, and K-nearest neighbour. Crowd-sourced data (individuals contribute their own data points to create a&#160;dataset for others to use) could play a&#160;role in minimizing data scarcity (Section&#160;10.2.4).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="123.2" top="378.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="378.48" x1="123.2" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 378.48; y1: 388.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.4 Gridding</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.82" top="354.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="354.6" x1="298.82" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Derived gridded datasets require merging data from different sources of observations and/or reanalysis data on a&#160;regular grid (Section&#160;10.2.1.2; e.g.,&#160;Xie and Arkin, 1997). However, in situ observations are distributed irregularly, especially over sparsely populated areas. This leads to an interpolation challenge.

The first approach has been widely employed in regions with high station density using interpolation techniques, such as inverse-distance weighting, optimal interpolation, and kriging (Chen et&#160;al., 2008; Haylock et&#160;al., 2008; Frei, 2014; Isotta et&#160;al., 2014; Masson and Frei, 2014; Hiebl and Frei, 2016; Nguyen-Xuan et&#160;al., 2016). The second approach has been mainly applied in data-sparse regions with low station density, using simple bias adjustment, quantile mapping, and kriging techniques with in situ observations, remote-sensing and reanalysis data (Cheema and Bastiaanssen, 2012; Erdin et&#160;al., 2012; Dinku et&#160;al., 2014; Abera et&#160;al., 2016; Kr&#228;henmann et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="78.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="78.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.55; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Gridding of station data is affected by uncertainties stemming from measurement errors, inhomogeneities, the distribution of the underlying stations and the interpolation error, with station density </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 311.37; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">interpolation is typically small for temperature but substantial for precipitation and its derivatives, such as drought indices (Chubb et&#160;al., 2015; Hellwig et&#160;al., 2018). The largest uncertainties typically occur in sparsely sampled mountain areas (Section&#160;10.2.2.5). Interpolation generally give rise to smoothing effects, such as low variability of the derived dataset with respect to the in situ observations (Chen et&#160;al., 2019). As a&#160;result, the effective resolution of gridded data is typically much lower than its nominal resolution. For instance, a&#160;5 km gridded precipitation dataset for the European Alps has an effective resolution of about 10 to 25 km (Isotta et&#160;al., 2014). In an example for precipitation in Spain, the effective resolution converged to the nominal resolution only when at least 6 to 7 stations were inside the&#160;gridcell (Herrera et&#160;al., 2019). To account for the smoothing errors, new stochastic ensemble observation datasets have been introduced (Von Clarmann, 2014).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="470.24" top="522.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="522.48" x1="470.24" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 522.48; y1: 532.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.5 Observations in Mountain Areas</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="498.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="498.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Spatiotemporal variability of meteorological parameters observed over mountainous areas is often large, indicating strong control exerted by local topography on meteorological parameters (Gultepe et&#160;al., 2014). Difficult access, harsh climatic conditions as well as instrumental issues make meteorological measurements extremely challenging at higher elevations (Azam et&#160;al., 2018; Beniston et&#160;al., 2018). Measurements of wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and radiative fluxes are critical for climate model evaluation, but difficult to handle due to their point-scale representativeness and small-scale spatiotemporal variability over mountainous terrain, and&#160;often need adjustment (Gultepe, 2015). High-altitude (&gt;3000&#160;metres) permanent meteorological stations are limited and current knowledge is mainly based on valley-bottom or low-elevation meteorological stations (Qin et&#160;al., 2009; Lawrimore et&#160;al., 2011; Gultepe, 2015; Condom et&#160;al., 2020), which, generally do not represent the higher elevation climate (Immerzeel et&#160;al., 2015; Shea&#160;et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="294.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="294.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 316.65; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Measuring precipitation amounts, especially of solid precipitation, in mountainous areas is particularly challenging due to the presence of orographic barriers, strong vertical and horizontal precipitation rate variability, and the difficulty in finding representative sites for precipitation measurements (Barry, 2012). However, the precipitation amounts can be indirectly estimated by the observed point mass balances at glacier accumulation areas representing net snow accumulation (Haimberger et&#160;al., 2012; Immerzeel et&#160;al., 2015; Sakai et&#160;al., 2015; Azam et&#160;al., 2018).

Precipitation measurements are also affected by the type of measurement method, presence/absence of shielding, presence/absence of a&#160;heating system and operating meteorological conditions (Nitu et&#160;al., 2018). Solid precipitation measurements may have errors ranging from 20% to 50%, largely due to under-catch in windy, icing and riming conditions (Rasmussen et&#160;al., 2012), and therefore require corrections by applying transfer functions developed mainly from collected wind speed and temperature data (Kochendorfer et&#160;al., 2017).
