<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Both space and time are fundamental in human activities and physical or ecological processes. geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) considers both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously which is one of the common spatiotemporal models that has been employed in many domains, including economy, environmental science, public health and others (He et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Huang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; W. Zhang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Unlike the global spatiotemporal models which assume the processes being examined to be constant over space and time, GTWR is the local model which is developed to account for local effects in both space and time (Fotheringham et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A weighting matrix integrating both spatial and temporal information is incorporated in the models.</p>
