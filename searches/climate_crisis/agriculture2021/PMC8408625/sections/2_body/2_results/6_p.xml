<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0155">As for the land use variables, the percentage of arable land and wetlands in a region (&#8220;Land-use model&#8221;) is positively correlated with the incidence of WNV and highly significant. However, the wetlands variable loses significance in the final model. The percentage of &#8220;Continuous&#8221; and &#8220;Discontinuous urban fabric&#8221; variables, which represent metropolitan and built up areas (residential suburbs, villages), are not statistically significant in any of the specifications. Although the partial effect plot for &#8220;Continuous urban fabric&#8221; reveals that it has a slightly negative relationship with WNV infections and &#8220;Discontinuous urban fabric&#8221; has a positive association with WNV infections.</p>
