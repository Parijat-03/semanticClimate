<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A <em>dynamical system</em> such as the <em>climate system</em>, governed by non-linear deterministic equations, may exhibit erratic or chaotic behaviour in the sense that very small changes in the initial state of the system lead to large and apparently unpredictable changes in its temporal evolution. Such chaotic behaviour limits the <em>predictability</em> of the state of a non-linear dynamical system at specific future times, although changes in its statistics may still be predictable given changes in the system parameters or boundary conditions.</p></dd>
