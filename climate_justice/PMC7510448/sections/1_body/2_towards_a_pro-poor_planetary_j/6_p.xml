This includes investments in the key sectors of food, water, energy, and infrastructure. The characteristics of global food production illustrate the challenges of radical transformations in these sectors: a select few multinational corporations control nearly all the global food business and consume 75% of the energy requirements of the entire food sector&#8212;but feed a much smaller proportion of the world's population (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">GRAIN &amp; IATP, 2018</xref>). There is little evidence that technological innovations, as proposed by ecomodernists (such as genetically modified crops) can escape the hold of special interests and support the livelihoods of the poor. On the other hand, smallholders with less than 5&#160;ha of agricultural land per farming household use only about 30% of the farm land to produce more than 70% of the total food calories in 83 countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and East Asia (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Samberg et&#160;al., 2016</xref>). Scaling up agroecological food systems would require the protection of the rights of the smallholders, as intended in the UNDROP.</p>
