      <td>The 2010&#8211;2011 food price spike was initially triggered by\nthe exceptional heat in summer 2010, with an extent from\nEurope to the Ukraine and Western Russia (Barriopedro et al.\n2011; Watanabe et al. 2013; Hoag 2014). The heatwave in\nRussia was extreme in both temperature (over 40&#176;C) and\nduration (from July to mid-August in 2010). This reduced\nwheat yields by approximately one third (Wegren 2011;\nMarchand et al. 2016). Simultaneously, in the Indus Valley in\nPakistan, unprecedented rainfall led to flooding, affecting the\nlives and livelihoods of 20 million people. There is evidence\nthat these effects were both linked and made more likely\nthrough climate change (Mann et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>In response to its shortfall in yields, Russia imposed an export\nban in order to maintain local food supplies. Other countries\nresponded in a largely uncoordinated ways, each of them\ndriven by internal politics as well as national self-interests\n(Jones and Hiller 2017). Overall, these measures led to rapid\nprice rises on the global markets (Welton 2011), partly\nthrough panic buying, but also through financial speculation\n(Spratt 2013).</td>

      <td>Analysis of responses to higher food prices in the developing\nworld showed that lower-income groups responded\nby taking on more employment, reducing food intake,\nlimiting expenditures, spending savings (if available), and\nparticipating in demonstrations. People often identified their\nproblems as stemming from collusion between powerful\nincumbent interests (e.g., of politicians and big business)\nand disregard for the poor (Hossain and Green 2011). This\npoliticised social response helped spark food-related civil\nprotest, including riots, across a range of countries in 2010&#8211;\n2011 (Natalini et al. 2017). In Pakistan, food price rises were\nexacerbated by the economic impacts of the floods, which\nfurther contributed to food-related riots in 2010.</td>

      <td>Price spikes also impact on food security in the developed\nworld. In the UK, global commodity price inflation influenced\nlocal food prices, increasing food-price inflation by about five\ntimes at the end of 2010. Comparing household purchases\nover the five-year period from 2007 to 2011 showed that\nthe amount of food bought declined, on average, by 4.2%,\nwhilst paying 12% more for it. The lowest income decile\nspent 17% more by 2011 than they did in 2007 (Holding et\nal. 2013; Tadasse et al. 2016). Consumers also saved money\nby trading down for cheaper alternatives. For the poorest, in\nthe extreme situation, food became unaffordable: the Trussell\nTrust, a charity supplying emergency food handouts for\npeople in crisis, noted a 50% increase in handouts in 2010.</td>
