<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A widely shared insight emerges about the importance of co-benefits thinking as a way to guide work across a range of scales and sectors to develop and sustain innovative and locally-relevant community and environmental health promoting activities [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When engaging in research with children/youth and by children/youth, the Centre of Excellence for Youth Engagement&#8217;s (CEYE) encourages researchers to consider engagement across the levels of the Individual, Social, and Systems to promote and sustain meaningful involvement [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Often referred to as the &#8216;head, heart and feet of engagement&#8217;, the intention is for research and practice to include cognitive (learning new things), affective (pleasure from participating), behavioral (active engagement) and spiritual components [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In sum, our work was informed by the integration of these frameworks to enrich research on the complex interaction of climate change, mental health, and children/youth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-04573-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
