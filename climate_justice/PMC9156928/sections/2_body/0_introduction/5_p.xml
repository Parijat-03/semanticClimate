Many studies measured recall for distant memories of activist behaviour. Measurement noise increases when the recalled events are further back in time, and when the measures do not specify the time or frequency [<xref rid="RSOS210006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Some studies also used unclear categorizations of what kind of activism was done and at what intensity [<xref rid="RSOS210006C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, evidence is emerging that self-reported pro-environmental behaviour is biased due to noisy recall [<xref rid="RSOS210006C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and is also influenced by people exaggerating their green identities when they are observed [<xref rid="RSOS210006C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
