These include implementation of more sustainable and ef&#64257;cient crop and livestock production practices aimed at reducing the amount of land needed per output (reductions in GHG emissions intensity from livestock and animal production can support reductions in absolute emissions if total production is constrained), bridging yield gaps, implementing better feeding practices for animals and &#64257;sh in aquaculture, and better manure management (FAO 2019a). Practices that promote soil improvements and carbon sequestration can also play an important role. In the South America region, reduction of deforestation, restoration of degraded pasture areas, and adoption of agroforestry and no-till agricultural techniques play a&#160;major role in the nation&#8217;s voluntary commitments to reduce GHG emissions in the country&#8217;s mitigation activities (Box&#160;5.4).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="375.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.26; y0: 375.56; y1: 385.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="375.56" x1="566.09">The importance of supply-side mitigation options is that these can be directly applied by food system actors (farmers, processors, retailers) and can contribute to improved livelihoods and income generation.
