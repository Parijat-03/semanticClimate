While they described diverse individual actions consistent with the general results most of them started their accounts by humble regrets, &#8220;I try,&#8221; &#8220;I attempt,&#8221; or &#8220;I wish I could.&#8221; Their awareness of the almost insignificant impact of individual actions appeared burdening. For example, one participant stated, &#8220;It is not bad at all to make environmentally friendly choices on an individual level, but there are much larger powers at play that are actively harming the climate. Without directly taking action to stop or regulate that harm on a larger scale, individual lifestyle changes will not make a large enough impact to save us.&#8221;</p>
