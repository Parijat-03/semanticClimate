<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We know taking action can help when we feel despair &#8211; but if we do not have support, good mentoring and capacity building opportunities, this action can lead to us burning out. We need adults around us to support our actions and help us be effective. Schools and the education department often tell us we can get in trouble for taking climate action. It would be great if they help us to be effective, find opportunities for us to talk with people that can make a difference, listen when we are angry, and, instead of dismissing us (telling us to stay in school and get good grades so we can get a good job), help us problem solve in a way that makes a genuine difference. We also need to find ways to be connected to Country, to learn from Aboriginal people, to care and understand this place we are living in.</p>
