      <td>Global surface temperature has evolved over geological time (Figure TS.1, Box TS.2). Beginning approximately 6500 years ago, global\nsurface temperature generally decreased, culminating in the coldest multi-century interval of the post-glacial period (since roughly\n7000 years ago), which occurred between around 1450 and 1850 (high confidence). Over the last 50 years, global surface temperature\nhas increased at an observed rate unprecedented in at least the last two thousand years (high confidence). Temperatures as high as\nduring the most recent decade (2011&#8211;2020) exceed the warmest centennial-scale range reconstructed for the present interglacial,\naround 6500 years ago [0.2&#176;C to 1&#176;C] (medium confidence). The next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago during\nthe Last Interglacial when the multi-centennial temperature range [0.5&#176;C to 1.5&#176;C] encompasses the 2011&#8211;2020 values (medium\nconfidence) (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1). During the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, around 3.3&#8211;3.0 million years ago, global surface\ntemperature was 2.5&#176;C to 4&#176;C warmer (medium confidence). {2.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and 2.4}</td>

This assessment is consistent with an estimate of the human-induced global surface\ntemperature rise based on assessed ranges of perturbations to the top of the atmosphere (effective radiative forcing) and with metrics\nof feedbacks of the climate response (equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response). Over the same period, well-\nmixed greenhouse gas forcing likely warmed global surface temperature by 1.0&#176;C to 2.0&#176;C, while aerosols and other anthropogenic\nforcings likely cooled global surface temperature by 0.0&#176;C to 0.8&#176;C. {2.3.1, 3.3.1, 7.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1}</td>

      <td>The observed slower increase in global surface temperature (relative to preceding and following periods) in the 1998&#8211;2012 period,\nsometimes referred to as &#8216;the hiatus&#8217;, was temporary (very high confidence). The increase in global surface temperature during the\n1998&#8211;2012 period is also greater in the data sets used in the AR6 assessment than in those available at the time of AR5. Using these\nupdated observational data sets and a like-for-like consistent comparison of simulated and observed global surface temperature, all\nobserved estimates of the 1998&#8211;2012 trend lie within the very likely range of CMIP6 trends. Furthermore, the heating of the climate\nsystem continued during this period, as reflected in the continued warming of the global ocean (very high confidence) and in the\ncontinued rise of hot extremes over land (medium confidence). Since 2012, global surface temperature has risen strongly, with the\npast five years (2016&#8211;2020) being the hottest five-year period between 1850 and 2020 (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.3.1, 3.5.1, Cross-\nChapter Box 3.1}</td>
