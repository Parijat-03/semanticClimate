The series serves both as scientific events tackling current topics in International Health, and as part of the study curriculum for students of the PhD Program Medical Research-International Health and the MSc Program in International Health. The majority of the students originate from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and conduct research projects targeting health challenges in their home countries. For the successful conception, organization and delivery of the symposium, students gain European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) points.</p>
