China faces similar issues to the EU in terms of geographically concentrated coal sector employment (Spencer, Berghmans and Sartor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2017</xref>, 22). More generally, it has been observed that the costs of China&#8217;s &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; reforms &#8216;have fallen disproportionately on the weakest parts of society&#8217; (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2018</xref>, 760). The official doctrine contains &#8216;little focus on redistribution&#8217; (Geall and Ely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>, 1186&#8211;87) and has much more to say on topics such as innovation. Others have argued that &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; is a &#8216;hollow concept&#8217; with little bearing on China&#8217;s actual practice of &#8216;environmental authoritarianism&#8217; (Li and Shapiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>, 197). There are nevertheless some references to poverty and disadvantaged central and western districts in key documents (e.g. CPC Central Committee/State Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>; Xi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2019</xref>), as well as an emerging practice of &#8216;ecological poverty alleviation&#8217; (People&#8217;s Daily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2020</xref>). There is also evidence that &#8216;ecological civilisation&#8217; has been co-opted by local activists in their struggles against environmental injustice (Hansen and Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>, 322).</p>
