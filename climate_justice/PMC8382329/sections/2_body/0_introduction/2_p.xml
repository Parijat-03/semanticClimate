But this responsibility is not reflected in mobilizing climate finance for supporting the particularly vulnerable countries (PVCs), who suffer the most from climate change. The Paris Agreement provides for this responsibility as well. The pledge by developed countries and the actual delivery of finance vary widely. Also, the issue of funding is extremely complex, particularly for adaptation, because of a lack of conceptual clarity in the regime and its accounting modality. The status of adaptation finance shows a gap in orders of magnitude between the estimated needs and the supply (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>). Despite pledges of a balanced allocation with mitigation, adaptation commands only 21% of international public climate finance (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>), of which grants are only 20%, the remaining being loans and non-grant instruments (Oxfam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>).</p>
