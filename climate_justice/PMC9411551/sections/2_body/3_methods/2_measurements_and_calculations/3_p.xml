Racial composition is measured by three variables:&#160;(1) proportion Hispanic or Latino (termed here as Latina/x/o; see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>), (2) proportion non-Latina/x/o black, and (3) proportion non-Latina/x/o, non-black, and non-white (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, two or more races, or another race). The proportion of non-Latina/x/o white is the reference group with which we compare the other ethnic/racial composition measures.</p>
