In the case of the Mediterranean Sea, increases in water temperature, higher than in the oceans, and acidification are expected. This may lead to the local extinction of more than 20% of exploited fish and marine invertebrates by 2050 and proliferation of species with a greater affinity for this environment, such as jellyfish. This would result in loss of marine food species, directly affecting the Mediterranean diet, as well as making coastal waters more dangerous for recreational uses and hindering a resource to cope with heat waves [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Between 1994 and 2017, total landings from Mediterranean fisheries have already decreased by 28% [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
