Constraints to land access include not only state policies, but also customary laws (Bayisenge 2018) based on customary norms and religion that determine women&#8217;s rights&#160;(Namubiru-Mwaura&#160;2014a).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.97" top="663.53"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.15; y0: 663.53; y1: 673.03; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="663.53" x1="551.97">Differential vulnerability to climate change is related to inequality in rights-based resource access, established through formal and&#160;informal tenure systems. In only 37% of 161 developing and developed countries do men and women have equal rights to use and control land, and in 59% customary, traditional, and religious practices discriminate against women (OECD 2014), even if the law formally grants equal rights. Women play a signi&#64257;cant role in agriculture, food security and rural economies globally, forming 43% of the agricultural labour force in developing countries (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, &amp; WHO, 2018, p. 102), ranging from 25%&#160;in&#160;Latin America (FAO, 2017, p. 89) to nearly 50% in Eastern Asia and Central and South Europe (FAO, 2017, p. 88) and 47% in Sub-Saharan Africa (FAO, 2017, pp. 88). Further, the share of women in agricultural employment has been growing in all developing regions except East Asia and Southeast Asia (FAO, 2017, p. 88). At the same time, women constitute less than 5% of&#160;landholders (with&#160;legal&#160;rights and/or use-rights (Doss et al. 2018a) in North Africa and West Asia, about 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 12% in Southern and Southeastern Asia, 18% in Latin America and Caribbean (FAO 2011b, p. 25), 10% in Bangladesh, 4%&#160;in&#160;Nigeria (FAO&#160;2015c). Patriarchal structures and gender roles can also affect women&#8217;s control over land in developed countries&#160;(Carter&#160;2017;&#160;Alston et al. 2018b). Thus, longstanding gender inequality in land rights, security of tenure, and&#160;decision-making may constrict&#160;women&#8217;s adaptation options (Smucker and Wangui 2016).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.91" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.15; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="495.55" x1="551.91">Adaptation options related to land and climate (see Chapter 6) may produce environment and development trade-offs as well as social con&#64258;icts (Hunsberger et al. 2017) and changes with gendered implications. Women&#8217;s strong presence in agriculture provides an opportunity to bring gender dimensions into climate change adaptation, particularly regarding food security (Glemarec 2017; Jost et al. 2016; Doss et al. 2018b). Some studies point to a potentially emancipatory role played by adaptation interventions and strategies, albeit with some limitations depending on context. For example, in developing contexts, male out-migration may cause women in socially disadvantaged groups to engage in new livelihood activities, thus challenging gendered roles (Djoudi and Brockhaus 2011; Alston 2006). Collective action and agency of women in farming households, including widows, have led to&#160;prevention of crop failure, reduced workload, increased nutritional intake, increased sustainable water management, diversi&#64257;ed and&#160;increased income and improved strategic planning (Andersson and Gabrielsson 2012). Women&#8217;s waged labour can help stabilise income from more land- and climate-dependent activities such as agriculture, hunting, or &#64257;shing (Alston et al., 2018; Ford&#160;and Goldhar, 2012). However, in developed contexts like Australia, women&#8217;s participation in off-farm employment may exacerbate existing masculinisation of agriculture (Clarke and Alston&#160;2017).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.94" top="339.57"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.57; y0: 339.57; y1: 349.07; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="339.57" x1="551.94">Literature suggests that land-based mitigation measures may lead to land alienation, either through market or appropriation (acquisition) by the government, may interfere with traditional livelihoods in rural areas, and lead to decline in women&#8217;s livelihoods (Hunsberger et al. 2017). If land alienation is not prevented, existing inequities and social exclusions may be reinforced (medium agreement) (Mustalahti and Rakotonarivo 2014; Chomba et al. 2016; Poudyal et al. 2016). These activities also can lead to land grabs, which remain a focal point for research and local activism (Borras Jr. et al. 2011; White et al. 2012; Lahiff 2015). Cumulative effects of land-based mitigation measures may put families at risk of poverty. In certain contexts, they lead to increased con&#64258;icts. In&#160;con&#64258;ict situations, women are at risk of personal violence, including sexual violence (UNEP, 2016). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="512.53" top="243.42"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.89; y0: 243.42; y1: 253.42; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="243.42" x1="512.53">Policy instruments for gender-inclusive approaches to climate change, land and sustainable development</span><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 76.0; y0: 231.52; y1: 241.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="231.52" x1="551.96">Integrating, or mainstreaming, gender into land and climate change policy requires assessments of gender-differentiated needs and priorities, selection of appropriate policy instruments to address barriers to women&#8217;s sustainable land management (SLM), and selection of gender indicators for monitoring and assessment of policy (medium con&#64257;dence) (Huyer et al. 2015a; Alston 2014). Important sex-disaggregated data can be obtained at multiple levels, including the intra-household level (Seager 2014; Doss et al. 2018b), village- and plot-level information (Theriault et al. 2017a), and through national surveys (Agarwal 2018a; Doss et al. 2015a). Gender-disaggregated data provides a basis for selecting, monitoring and reassessing policy instruments that account for gender-differentiated land and climate change needs (medium con&#64257;dence) (Rao 2017a; Arora-Jonsson 2014; Theriault et al. 2017b; Doss et al. 2018b). While macro-level data can reveal ongoing gender trends in SLM, contextual data are important for revealing intersectional aspects, such as the difference made by family relations, socio-economic status, or cultural practices about land use and control (Rao 2017a; Arora-Jonsson 2014; Theriault et al. 2017b), as well as on security of land holding (Doss et al. 2018b). Indices such as the Women&#8217;s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Alkire et al. 2013b) may provide useful guidelines for quantitative data collection on gender and SLM, while qualitative studies can reveal the nature of agency and whether policies are likely to be accepted, or not, in the context of local structures, meanings, and social relations (Rao 2017b).</span></div></body></html>
