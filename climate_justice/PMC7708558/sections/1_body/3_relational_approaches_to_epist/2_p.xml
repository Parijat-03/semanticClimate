<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par26">There is broad consensus that modern western epistemologies arising from the Enlightenment and scientific revolution are largely responsible for creating profound divisions and patterns of exploitation between humans and nonhumans. Their intellectual foundations were formed by figures such as Isaac Newton, Immanuel Kant, David Hume, John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Ren&#233; Descartes (Griffin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>). They posit: (1) The idea that causation is determined only by external relations between objects; (2) that no object can be understood outside its relation to thought; (3) that primary and secondary (sensible) qualities are separable and that science can objectively study the former without the latter; (4) that nature can be mastered, &#8216;her&#8217; secrets revealed to instrumental reason and scientific &#8216;progress&#8217;; and finally, (5) that mind and body are separable substances, and that the latter is the domain of objective scientific inquiry. These ideas formed the philosophy of empiricism that shaped the development of science, technology, and industry throughout the modern period. Though these ideas have been profoundly influential in shaping society, as Latour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1991</xref>) argues, we have never been truly modern. Despite modern people believing nature could be understood objectively, scientific knowledge is fundamentally shaped by social relations and practices. Researchers have always shaped and been shaped by the objects of their research. As such, many researchers now increasingly use reflexive methods to account for the observer&#8217;s role in shaping knowledge (May and Perry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2017</xref>).</p>
