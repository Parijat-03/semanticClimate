Over more than a decade since RACC-1 relevant thinking has become more integrated. Mitigation and adaptation are now seen as complementary parts of the climate action agenda, biodiversity is being integrated into economic planning, and there is increasing interest in research in geo-engineering, whose acceptability depends on the progress (or lack thereof) in the other components of the security and sustainability agenda.</p>
