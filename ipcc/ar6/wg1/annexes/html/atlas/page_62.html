Seasonally, there is a decline in cool season (April to October) precipitation in southwest 7 Western Australia, see Figure Atlas.35:, with an attributable human influence (Delworth and Zeng, 2014, 8 and others).  9 10 In New Zealand between 1960 and 2016, winter rainfall increased in Whangarei, Wellington, and New 11 Plymouth, while summer rainfall increased in Dunedin and Kerikeri (New Zealand Ministry for the 12 Environment &amp; Statistics, 2017). Note however, for the most part, the above reported trends have been 13 classified as statistically not significant.

WGI AR5 reported that model biases in annual temperature and rainfall are 22 similar to or lower than other continental regions outside the tropics, with temperature biases generally &lt;1&#176;C 23 in the multi-model mean and &lt;2&#176;C in most models over Australia compared to reanalysis, and a wet bias 24 over the Australian inland region but a dry bias near coasts and mountain regions of both Australia and New 25 Zealand.  26 27 Early results from CMIP6 suggest incremental improvements compared to CMIP5 in the simulation of the 28 mean annual climatology of temperature and precipitation of the Indo-Pacific region surrounding 29 Australasia, the teleconnection between ENSO and IOD and Australian rainfall and other relevant climate 30 features (Grose et al., submitted). These assessments suggest that confidence in projections is similar to AR5 31 or incrementally improved. CORDEX Australasia simulations are found to have cold biases in daily 32 maximum temperature and an overestimation of precipitation but overall showed some added value on the 33 simulation of the current climate.  34 35 36 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 316.37; y1: 327.35; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="316.37" x1="291.56">Atlas.5.4.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="316.37" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 316.37; y1: 327.35; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">37 38 This section is limited to mean temperature and precipitation, projected changes to other variables for 39 Australasia are summarised in Chapter 12 of WGI and Chapter 11 of WGII.

CMIP5 projections as reported in the 47 Australian national climate projections using the AR5 baseline are shown in Table Atlas.6:, indicating 48 increases of around 0.5 to 1.5&#176;C over the century under RCP2.6 and around 2.7 to 5.0&#176;C under RCP8.5 in all 49 four tailored regions within the country. For New Zealand, the Ministry for the Environment (2018) projects 50 an increase of mean temperature of 0.7&#176;C (RCP2.6) and 1.0&#176;C (RCP8.5) to 2040, and 0.7&#176;C (RCP2.6) and 51 3.0&#176;C (RCP8.5) by 2090 relative to 1986-2005, with higher increase in summer than in winter and more 52 pronounced in mountainous areas. Temperature projections in the CMIP6 ensemble as it stands in the Atlas 53 are not significantly different than CMIP5, except for a warmer high end of the range (see Figure Atlas.34:), 54 for example the 10&#8211;90th percentile range of modelled temperature change averaged over the land regions of 55 </span></div></body></html>
