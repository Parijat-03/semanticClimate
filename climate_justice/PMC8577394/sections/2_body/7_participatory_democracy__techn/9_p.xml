In the case of planning for climate change, city officials rely on and leverage expert and professional knowledge systems about the future from engineers and climate scientists &#8211; knowledge that is not easily producible by or legible to most participants in the planning process &#8211; to shore up the legitimacy of their decisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> While the city elicited input from &#8220;lay experts&#8221; with unique knowledge about neighborhood conditions, with the explicit aim to be inclusive of anyone with a claim to expertise on the subject of neighborhood flood vulnerability and public space, ultimately the voice of credentialed technical expert professionals prevailed in designing the final version of the plan. The result was a legitimacy crisis that the government could not undo despite their repeated appeals to the objectivity and rationality of technical experts.</p>
