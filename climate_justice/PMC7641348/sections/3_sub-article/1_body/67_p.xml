<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This paper uses three vulnerability indices for California to show how census-tract assessments of vulnerability are sensitive to the choice of vulnerability index. The paper further investigates how adaptation projects are distributed across census tracts, and shows how well the projects are meeting the target of helping vulnerable populations. The findings reveal that relying on a single index (CES) in the distribution of these projects could leave out some vulnerable communities that are shown to be vulnerable by other indices other than the CES. Overall, I found this paper to be extremely well written and informative. This is an important and timely topic and should be of interest to many. This work clearly has applications to climate change adaptation and planning in California. I see no major issues with the article, and I think it is acceptable for publication after addressing a few minor comments listed below.</p>
