This is particularly important in the food and land use systems sectors. Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) and other schemes related to payment for ecosystem services (PES) have a mixed track record. Building on lessons learned, such mechanisms should be reformed and strengthened to reward those farmers and other stakeholders who act as stewards of the environment and promote a wider adoption of sustainable land management practices.</p>
