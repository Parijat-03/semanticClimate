In addition to making visible the miserable conditions of immigrant workers, COVID 19 raised public concern, well known among experts, about antibiotic resistance, and the high risk of zoonosis&#8212;animal to human viral transmission&#8212;in industrial meat processing (Attwood and Hajat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). The next pandemic will likely come from the food system and spread through its workers (Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Wallace et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). Whereas immigrant workers are paradoxically &#8220;essential,&#8221; &#8220;illegal,&#8221; and expendable, the meat industry is both &#8220;essential&#8221; and a threat to human health and the environment.</p>
