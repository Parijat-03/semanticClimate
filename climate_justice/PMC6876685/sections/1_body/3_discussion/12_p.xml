<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We suspect that few science educators would argue that ecology majors are the only population responsible for responding to the effects of climate change. Climate justice is a project requiring collective action from professional scientists and nonscientists alike. Our introductory courses are one place for us to invite and inspire a broader population to take part in this work&#8212;and, in turn, to extend this invitation to the broader publics they participate in. To the extent that our courses can provide a foundation for future climate activism, how we teach about climate change is <italic>in itself</italic> a matter of climate justice. Learning about climate change means more than learning about climate systems&#8212;it means also learning about active ways to equitably, productively, and sustainably intervene in those systems. We argue that classroom instruction does a disservice to students if it deepens their knowledge about climate change but also leaves them feeling such despair and disempowerment that they are disinclined to try to make a difference. Our study suggests that instructors should go beyond simply characterizing the causes and consequences of climate change. To the extent we are preaching to the proverbial choir, we do well to empower students and support them in composing new verses. In increasing students' senses of possibility and efficacy, instructors can help them emerge more fully climate literate: ready not just for readerly recognition, but also writerly action.</p>
