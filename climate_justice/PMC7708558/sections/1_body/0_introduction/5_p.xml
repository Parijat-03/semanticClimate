After describing our method of analysis (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methodology</xref>&#8221;), we present what relational approaches to ontology encompass (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Ontology</xref>&#8221;), how relational approaches to epistemology can shape research practice (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Epistemology</xref>&#8221;), and the normative, ethical orientations underlying relational approaches to sustainability (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Ethics</xref>&#8221;). On this basis, we discuss the identified trends, themes, and patterns characterizing a relational approach to sustainability, concluding with recommendations for future research (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Conclusions</xref>&#8221;).</p>
