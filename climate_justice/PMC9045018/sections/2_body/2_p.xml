Drawing upon the expertise of noted clinical social work scholars in their respective areas, I enlisted guest editors for a wide range of au courant topics: agency-based practice with vulnerable populations, the art and science of social work, case-based research, child and adolescent therapy, clinical practice with older adults, cybertechnology, DSM-5, evidence-informed and evidence-based practice models, family and couples treatment, group therapy, integrative treatment, LGBTQ clinical work, medical social work, mindfulness, psychoanalysis and clinical social work, a retrospective of social work practice in celebration of Flexner, secondary trauma and compassion fatigue, simulation in field education, supervision in field work and agency settings, and most recently, the impact of COVID-19 on the educational and therapeutic processes. In all, half of the 62 issues during my tenure have been special issues guest edited by prominent scholars and academics, many of whom serve on the editorial board, including Editor-in-Chief Elect, Dr. Melissa Grady.</p>
