Seeking to integrate strategies for achieving adaptation and mitigation goals is attractive in order to reduce competition for limited resources and trade-offs (Lobell et al.&#160;2013; Berry et al.&#160;2015; Kongsager and Corbera 2015). Moreover, determinants that can foster adaptation and mitigation practices are similar. These tend to include available technology and resources, and credible information for policymakers to act on (Yohe 2001).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="567.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="567.54" x1="313.23">Four sets of mitigation&#8211;adaptation interrelationships can be distinguished: (i) mitigation actions that can result in adaptation bene&#64257;ts; (ii) adaptation actions that have mitigation bene&#64257;ts; (iii)&#160;processes that have implications for both adaptation and mitigation; and (iv) strategies and policy processes that seek to promote an integrated set of responses for both adaptation and mitigation (Klein et al.&#160;2007). A&#160;high level of adaptive capacity is a&#160;key ingredient to developing successful mitigation policy. Implementing mitigation action can result in increasing resilience especially if it is able to reduce risks. Yet, mitigation and adaptation objectives, scale of implementation, sector and even metrics to identify impacts tend to differ (Ayers and Huq 2009), and institutional setting, often does not enable an environment where synergies are sought (Kongsager et al.&#160;2016). Trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation exist as well and need to be understood (and avoided) to establish win-win situations (Porter et al.&#160;2014; Kongsager et al.&#160;2016).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="363.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 363.56; y1: 373.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="363.56" x1="313.22">Forestry and agriculture offer a&#160;wide range of lessons for the integration of adaptation and mitigation actions given the vulnerability of forest ecosystems or cropland to climate variability and change (Keenan 2015; Gaba et al.&#160;2015) (Sections&#160;5.6 and&#160;4.8). Increasing adaptive capacity in forested areas has the potential to prevent deforestation and forest degradation (Locatelli et al.&#160;2011). Reforestation projects, if well managed, can increase community economic opportunities that encourage conservation (Nelson and de Jong 2003), build capacity through training of farmers and installation of multifunctional plantations with income generation (Reyer et al.&#160;2009), strengthen local institutions (Locatelli et al.&#160;2015a) and increase cash-&#64258;ow to local forest stakeholders from foreign donors (West 2016). A&#160;forest plantation that sequesters carbon for mitigation can also reduce water availability to downstream populations and heighten their vulnerability to drought. Inversely, not recognising mitigation in adaptation projects may yield adaptation measures that increase greenhouse gas emissions, a&#160;prime example of &#8216;maladaptation&#8217;. Analogously, &#8216;mal-mitigation&#8217; would result in reducing GHG emissions, but increasing vulnerability (Barnett and&#160;O&#8217;Neill 2010; Porter et al.&#160;2014). For instance, the cost of pursuing large-scale adaptation and mitigation projects has been associated with higher failure risks, onerous transactions costs and the complexity of managing big projects (Swart and Raes 2007).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="75.6"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 75.6; y1: 85.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="75.6" x1="313.24">Adaptation encompasses both biophysical and socio-economic vulnerability and underlying causes (informational, capacity, </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="735.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 735.6; y1: 745.1; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.6" x1="571.76">&#64257;nancial, institutional, and technological; Huq et al.&#160;2014) and it is increasingly linked to resilience and to broader development goals (Huq et al.&#160;2014). Adaptation measures can increase performance of mitigation projects under climate change and legitimise mitigation measures through the more immediately felt effects of adaptation (Locatelli et al.&#160;2011; Campbell et al.&#160;2014; Locatelli et al.&#160;2015b). Effective climate policy integration in the land sector is expected to gain from (i) internal policy coherence between adaptation and mitigation objectives, (ii) external climate coherence between climate change and development objectives, (iii) policy integration that favours vertical governance structures to foster effective mainstreaming of climate change into sectoral policies, and (iv) horizontal policy integration through overarching governance structures to enable cross-sectoral coordination (Sections&#160;1.4 and&#160;7.4).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="474.66" top="543.01"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.96; y0: 543.01; y1: 555.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="543.01" x1="474.66">1.4 Enabling the response</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="519.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 519.52; y1: 529.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="519.52" x1="571.76">Climate change and sustainable development are challenges to society that require action at local, national, transboundary and global scales. Different time-perspectives are also important in decision-making, ranging from immediate actions to long-term planning and investment. Acknowledging the systemic link between food production and consumption, and land-resources more broadly is expected to enhance the success of actions (Bazilian et al.&#160;2011; Hussey and Pittock 2012). Because of the complexity of challenges and the diversity of actors involved in addressing these challenges, decision-making would bene&#64257;t from a&#160;portfolio of policy instruments. Decision-making would also be facilitated by overcoming barriers such as inadequate education and funding mechanisms, as well as integrating international decisions into all relevant (sub)national sectoral policies (Section&#160;7.4).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="339.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.0; y0: 339.55; y1: 349.05; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="339.55" x1="571.78">&#8216;Nexus thinking&#8217; emerged as an alternative to the sector-speci&#64257;c governance of natural resource use to achieve global securities of water (D&#8217;Odorico et al.&#160;2018), food and energy (Hoff 2011; Allan et al.&#160;2015), and also to address biodiversity concerns (Fischer et al.&#160;2017).
