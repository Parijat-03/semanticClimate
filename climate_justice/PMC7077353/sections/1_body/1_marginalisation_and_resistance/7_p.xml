It shows how constraints that typically apply to ethnic Bengali women also apply to Santal women, such as time-consuming responsibility for household and care work, and an inability to sell agricultural produce at formal markets. These constraints are shown in blue. However, the position of Santal women is worsened through identity-based discrimination, the loss of land, general lack of targeting in development programmes and even lower literacy than the average for Muslim women. Constraints specific to Santal women are shown in orange. Low-income Muslim women share some constraints with Santal women, particularly engagement in low-paying day labour. The constraints shared by Santal and low-income Muslim women are shown in green. These drivers of marginalisation can act together to create a downward spiral, whereby negative outcomes cause further negative outcomes. The outcomes are unevenly distributed among women, with Santal women experiencing the most intense overlapping of drivers.</p>
