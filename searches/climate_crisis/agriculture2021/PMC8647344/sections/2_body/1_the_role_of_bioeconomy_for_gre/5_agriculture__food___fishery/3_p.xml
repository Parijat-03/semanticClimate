From rooftop agriculture to community gardening and vertical farming, urban agriculture could improve lives and contribute to green recovery by reducing urban areas' dependency on long-distance supply chains and enhancing consumers' education (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). The diversification of distribution systems and support of logistic infrastructures to keep added value on-farm will lead to a partial re-territorialization of food systems, providing local communities with a higher governance degree of the distribution system (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Mar&#233;chal et al., 2020</xref>). Education, nutritional guidelines, and public procurement could also be mobilized to support the consumption of locally produced food and ensure sustainable and healthy diets.</p>
