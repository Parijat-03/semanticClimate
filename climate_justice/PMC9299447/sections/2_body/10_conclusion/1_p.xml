<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To support children and young people affected by climate change, WA requires a response that addresses the systemic causes of climate change &#8211; colonialism, capitalism and dangerously high emissions &#8211; while simultaneously strengthening the capacity of parents, adults and youth and mental health sectors to respond to young people experiencing climate change&#8208;related stresses. Decolonising our systems must go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with preventing dangerous climate change and supporting mental health, wellbeing, and resilience. As climate events increase in frequency, intensity and duration, mental health services must work with children and young people across cultures to co&#8208;design culturally safe and appropriate strategies that support and increase resilience to the psychological impacts of climate change.<xref rid="jpc15649-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">
