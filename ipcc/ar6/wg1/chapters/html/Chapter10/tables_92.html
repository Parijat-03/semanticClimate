      <td>nighttime canopy urban heat island effect (Bader et al., 2018; Kuang, 2019; Li et al., 2019; Y. Li et al., 2020a). While green and blue\ninfrastructures can mitigate the urban heat island effect, three main factors contribute to its development (Hamdi et al., 2020; Masson\net al., 2020): (i) three-dimensional urban geometry including building density and plan area, street aspect ratio and building height;\n(ii) thermal characteristics of impervious surfaces; and (iii) anthropogenic heat release, either from building energy consumption,\nespecially waste heat from air conditioning systems, or as direct emissions from industry, traffic, or human metabolism (Ichinose et al.,\n1999; Sailor, 2011; de Munck et al., 2013; Bohnenstengel et al., 2014; Chow et al., 2014; Salamanca et al., 2014; Dou and Miao, 2017;\nMa et al., 2017a; Chrysoulakis et al., 2018; Takane et al., 2019). Urban heat island magnitude is also affected by aerosols due to air\npollution in urban areas (Cheng et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020) and by local background climate (Zhao et al., 2014; Ward et al., 2016).</td>

      <td>are scarce (Bader et al., 2018; Caluwaerts et al., 2020). Moreover, urban observation sites often represent only parts of the urban\nenvironment and are suboptimal for detecting urban effects (e.g., sites in city parks). Recently, city-scale climate monitoring networks\nas well as satellite and ground-based remote sensing are being used (though still missing in Global South cities; Technical Annex I),\nenhancing our understanding of the urban microclimate and its interaction with climate change, and providing key information\nfor users (F. Chen et al., 2012; Barlow et al., 2017; Bader et al., 2018). It has been found that harmonization of collection practices,\ninstrumentation, station locations, and quality control methodologies across urban environments needs improvement to facilitate\ncollaborative research (Muller et al., 2013; Barlow et al., 2017). Real time crowdsourcing data is becoming available (Section 10.2.4).\nThe urban climate community is making efforts to understand how these methods can complement traditional datasets (Meier et al.,\n2017; Zheng et al., 2018; Langendijk et al., 2019b; Venter et al., 2020).</td>

      <td>atmosphere exchange schemes. Three different schemes, here in order of increasing complexity, can be distinguished (Masson, 2006;\nGrimmond et al., 2010, 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Best and Grimmond, 2015): (i) in the slab or bulk approach, the three-dimensional city\nstructure is not resolved but cities are represented by modifying soil and vegetation parameters within land surface models, increasing\nroughness length and displacement height (e.g., Seaman et al., 1989; Dandou et al., 2005; Best et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006). The energy\nbalance is often modified to account for the radiation trapped by the urban canopy, heat storage, evaporation and anthropogenic\nheat fluxes. (ii) Single-layer urban canopy modules use a simplified geometry (urban canyon, with three surface types: roof, road and\nwall) that approximately capture the three-dimensional dynamical and thermal physical processes influencing radiative and energy\nfluxes (Masson, 2000; Kusaka et al., 2001). (iii) Multi-layer urban canopy modules compute urban effects vertically, allowing a direct\ninteraction with the planetary boundary layer (Brown, 2000; Martilli et al., 2002; Hagishima et al., 2005; Dupont and Mestayer, 2006;\nHamdi and Masson, 2008; Schubert et al., 2012). Building-energy models that estimate anthropogenic heat from a building for given\natmospheric conditions can be incorporated. Recent model development has focused on improving the representation of urban\nvegetation (Lee et al., 2016; Redon et al., 2017; Mussetti et al., 2020).</td>

There is very high confidence (robust evidence and\nhigh agreement) that while all types of urban parametrizations generally simulate radiation exchanges in a realistic way, they have\nstrong biases when simulating latent heat fluxes, though recent research incorporating in-canyon vegetation processes improved their\nperformance. There is medium confidence (medium evidence, high agreement) (Kusaka et al., 2012b; McCarthy et al., 2012; Hamdi\net al., 2014; Trusilova et al., 2016; J&#228;nicke et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2019) that a simple single-layer parametrization, is sufficient for\nthe correct simulation of the urban heat island magnitude and its interplay with regional climate change.</td>
