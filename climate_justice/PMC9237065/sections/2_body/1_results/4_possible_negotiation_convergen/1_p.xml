One could be to minimize deviations from planned reductions as a result of established policies. Implementing such a target in our analysis would mean that when determining national budgets to 2030 using a single interpretation of each of the three equity principles from Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, a weighted combination of the three can be identified that ensures that countries have to do the least additional effort beyond what they agreed in 2018 for their respective reduction by 2030. They may want to keep planned reductions as close to this prior agreement as possible, in order to avoid sudden drastic changes in requirements or policy. In this case, a combination of interpretations can be identified which minimizes the aggregate effort of all EU countries beyond their prior agreement. Formally, the sum of squares of these deviations is minimized (see &#8220;Methods&#8221;). We define each of these weighting combinations as&#160;&#8220;negotiation points&#8221; and calculate one for each possible combination of the three equity criteria interpretations discussed (60 in all). As a second metric for comparison, we also minimize aggregate deviation from what is the upper bound of equity-compatible emissions for each country, i.e. an emission level that can be considered equitable by at least one interpretation. The results of these calculations for both cases, namely, a &#8216;least deviation from past share allocation&#8217; (blue points, corresponding to minimizing the deviation compared to the 2018 ESR) and a &#8216;least deviation from the upper bound of equity-compatible emissions&#8217; (marked in orange), are identified in the ternary inset panel in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Note that results of the latter are robust against the integration of any further equity interpretations as long as our interpretations cover the overall possible range, a goal which guided their selection (see SI, sections <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2&#8211;4</xref>). Each point in the inset panel represents a combination of one each of an equality, responsibility, and capability interpretation (applied to all countries) which meets the 55% EU reduction target.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Negotiation points derived from optimal weighting of equity interpretations and their resulting reductions by 2030 by country.</title><p>The box and whisker plots in the main panel show the resulting range of emissions reductions by 2030 by country, corresponding to the negotiation convergence points shown in the inset equity triangle. The solid black line indicates the &#8216;fit for 55%&#8217; reduction target for each country and the dotted line the required reduction if each country were to reduce an equal percentage in the effort-sharing sector to meet the 2030 goals (corresponding to &#8722;44%). Points in the inset ternary chart denote negotiation points when using an allocation approach comprised of weighted combinations of three equity principles, point size indicates frequency, i.e. multiple points at one location. Orange points and boxes are for minimizations of EU aggregate additional effort above Member States upper bound of equity-compatible emissions, and blue for minimal deviation from the 2018 ESR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31204_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e810"/></fig></p>
