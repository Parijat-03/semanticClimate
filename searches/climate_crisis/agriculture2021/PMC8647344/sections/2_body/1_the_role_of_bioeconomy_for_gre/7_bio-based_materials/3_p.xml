<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0360">Wood-based products (e.g., wood-based textiles, nanocellulose, and bioplastics) represent a reservoir of sequestered carbon that could be used for textiles, furniture, fiber, and construction. An approach towards green recovery, climate change mitigation, and resilience in the post-pandemic world is valorizing woody biomass to produce a wide range of bio-based materials (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>). New wood-based textiles have been reported to have a climate mitigation effect of 5&#160;kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg of product used compared to polyester (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>). Moreover, a shift to biomaterials (based on engineering wood or bamboo) could substantially reduce the number of materials used and our cities' carbon footprint while creating durable carbon pools (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Churkina et al., 2020</xref>). Using wood in construction has a climate mitigation effect of 2.4&#8211;2.9&#160;kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg of wood contained in products used compared to concrete (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">EFI, 2017</xref>) while also storing 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> in each m<sup>3</sup> of products. Building with wood is also more resource-efficient: It can reduce the total amount of materials used in construction by 50% (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>) and be a key priority in green recovery. However, the growth of biomaterial demand should not create additional pressure on natural resources. Cascading the use of biomass &#8211; which is a fundamental part of a circular bioeconomy &#8211; will contribute to reducing additional pressure on land for biomass (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
