Most central to this study&#8217;s focus on climate justice, we find that Latina/x/o neighborhoods, especially low-income Latina/x/o neighborhoods, had greater odds of flooding (compared to other types of neighborhoods) only because of the added climate change-induced precipitation. This finding held for both depths and damages across each of the climate change-attribution scenarios, although the interaction effect for Latina/x/o and median income is slightly smaller in models for the 38% scenario (where <italic>p</italic> values are 0.064 for Model 2 and 0.07 for Model 4). Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> graphs these findings with predicted probabilities by estimating the percentage of climate change-only flooded properties at different population shares of Latina/x/o residents and median income. As an example, the estimates show that for a high Latina/x/o population share, low-income (90%, $25,000 median income) neighborhood, we would estimate that ~9% of parcels in the 38% scenario (and 6% in the 20% scenario) would not have flooded if not for climate change.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Predicted probabilities of parcel flooding only because of climate change.</title><p>Predicted probabilities calculated for binary logistic regression results in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> at levels of percent Latina/x/o, for Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, TX.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31056_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e1297"/></fig></p>
