A study on projected irrigation requirements under climate change using a soil-moisture model for 29 upland crops in the Republic of Korea showed that water scarcity is a major limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production (Hong et&#160;al., 2016). In terms of drought, despite increasing future precipitation in most scenarios, crop-specific agricultural drought is expected to be a significant risk due to rainfall variability (Lim et&#160;al., 2019a).

In Japan, the projected decline in rice yield in some areas suggests that the current rice-producing regions would be divided into suitable and unsuitable areas as temperatures increases (Ishigooka et&#160;al., 2017), with important implications regarding the possible shift in cropping area. Similarly, it has been shown that there will be change in the geographic distribution of the occurrence of poor skin colour of table-grape berries (Sugiura et&#160;al., 2019) and suitable areas for cultivation of subtropical citrus (Sugiura et&#160;al., 2014) in Japan by the middle of the 21st century.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.09" top="366.65"><span x0="42.52" y0="366.65" x1="296.09" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 366.65; y1: 376.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is emerging evidence from modelling and field experimentation that designing future farming systems and crop areas that will promote sustainable development in Asia in the context of climate change would have to incorporate not only productivity and price considerations but also how to moderate temperature increase, enhance water conservation and optimise GHG mitigation potential (Sapkota et&#160;al., 2015; Zhang et&#160;al., 2016a; Ko et&#160;al., 2017; Lim et&#160;al., 2017b).

There is significant evidence that climate change significantly undermines both agricultural production and food security in Asia (ADB, 2017b). Increasing evidence from sub-regions and individual countries suggests that climate-related hazards, such as increasing temperature, changing rainfall, SLR, drought, flooding and the more frequent and intense occurrences of El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation events, all impact agricultural production with significant effects on food security.

Saudi Arabia, for instance, was forced to phase out its wheat production starting in 2016 and fully rely on importation to conserve its drying fossil water resources (Al-Zahrani et&#160;al., 2019), a situation which is also linked to a water governance issue.</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.14" top="582.64"><span x0="306.56" y0="582.64" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 308.86; y0: 582.64; y1: 592.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In Central Asia, a study using a bioeconomic farm model shows very large differences in climate change impacts across farming systems at the subnational level.

In Southeast Asia, a Philippine study on the relationship between seasonal rainfall, agricultural production and civil conflict suggests that the projected change towards wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons in many parts of the country will lead to more civil conflict (Crost et&#160;al., 2018) with negative implications for food and human security.
