<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The majority of prior academic research on predictive journalism has been focused on
either interpreting model outcomes, describing journalistic practices in this genre
of data journalism, or the way models were presented to the public (<xref rid="bibr31-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Pentzold et al., 2021</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr44-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al.,
2020</xref>). Westwood et al. focused on the consequences of misinterpreting
projections in predictive journalism articles on demobilizing the public in election
forecasts (2020). In the context of COVID, Pentzold et al. looked at how predictive
models in the news were presented and discussed in news products and whether such
models did a good job casting away uncertainty and ambiguity around COVID-19 (2021).
Moving beyond these prior studies, the present research focuses on describing

pandemic by elaborating themes that reflect the types of responses found in online
news comments</p>
