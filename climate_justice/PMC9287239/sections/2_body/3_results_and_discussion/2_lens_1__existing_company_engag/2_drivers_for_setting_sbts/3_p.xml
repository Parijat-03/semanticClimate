Piper and Longhurst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] (also a preprint) surveyed eight companies (representing 25% of UK companies with SBTs at the time) about their carbon management practices followed by interviews of five of these companies. Participants acknowledged target-setting decisions tend to be driven by economics (rather than climate change concerns) and identified both credibility and standardization as the two predominant motivations for setting SBTs. According to participants, SBTs aid in future-proofing, linking individual climate actions to coherent measures, developing a sustainable carbon trajectory, making comparisons to other companies, and protecting the company&#8217;s reputation. Kuo and Chang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] considered the relationship of SBT adoption and internal carbon pricing on the carbon management reputation of Japanese companies, with CDP scores used as a proxy for the latter. For companies in low-carbon emitting industries, there was a stronger positive relationship between SBT adoption and CDP score. In high-carbon emitting industries, CDP score was higher for companies that adopted both SBTs and internal carbon pricing. Since the CDP scoring methodology awards point for SBT adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and companies that report to CDP are more likely to set SBTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], it is not surprising that companies with SBTs tend to have higher CDP scores than companies without. However, the relationship between SBT adoption and other types of corporate climate action evaluated by the CDP scoring methodology remains unexplored, e.g., if SBT adoption has positive &#8220;spillover&#8221; effects on other types of corporate climate action evaluated (such as board oversight of climate-related issues) or if companies that are already doing well across the items evaluated by the CDP scoring methodology are likely to adopt SBTs. Regardless, the correlation of SBT adoption and CDP scores provides additional (albeit limited) support for increased credibility as a motivator for SBT adoption. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] also observed that a significant proportion of global companies setting SBTs had already earned a high CDP score, reinforcing the importance of past success in driving SBT adoption.</p>
