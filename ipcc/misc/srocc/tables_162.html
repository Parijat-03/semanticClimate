Fire frequencies under 2050 conditions\nare projected to increase by approximately 27% globally, relative to the 2000 levels, with changes in future fire meteorology playing\nthe most important role in enhancing global wildfires, followed by land cover changes, lightning activities and land use, while changes\nin population density exhibit the opposite effects (Huang et al. 2014).</td>

      <td>However, climate is only one driver of a complex set of environmental, ecological and human factors in infl uencing fi re regimes\n(Bowman et al. 2011). While these factors lead to complex projections of future burnt area and fi re emissions (Knorr et al. 2016a, b),\nhuman exposure to wildland fi res could still increase due to population expansion into areas already under high risk of fi res (Knorr\net al. 2016a, b). There are still major challenges in projecting future fi re regimes and how climate, vegetation and socio/economic\nfactors will interact (Hantson et al. 2016; Harris et al. 2016). There is also need for integrating various fi re management strategies, such\nas fuel-reduction treatments in natural and planted forests, with other environmental and societal considerations to achieve the goals\nof carbon emissions reductions, maintain water quality, biodiversity conservation and human safety (Moritz et al. 2014; Gharun\net al. 2017).</td>

      <td>In summary, climate change is playing an increasing role in determining wildfi re regimes alongside human activity (medium confi dence),\nwith future climate variability expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfi res in many biomes, such as tropical rainforests (high\nconfi dence). Fire weather seasons have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confi dence). Global land area burned has\ndeclined in recent decades, mainly due to less burning in grasslands and savannas (high confi dence). While drought remains the\ndominant driver of fi re emissions, there has recently been increased fi re activity in some tropical and temperate regions during normal\nto wetter-than-average years due to warmer temperatures that increase vegetation fl ammability (medium confi dence). The boreal\nzone is also experiencing larger and more frequent fi res, and this may increase under a warmer climate (medium confi dence).</td>
