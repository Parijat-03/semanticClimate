The injunction's original &#8216;10-min warning&#8217; system was eliminated after police found that some protestors took turns switching positions as the 10-min were about to end. Indigenous strategies included those of the Tiny House Warriors, who were protecting land belonging to their ancestors by building houses on the path to TMX. Other resistance strategies involved a Watch House (&#8220;Kwekwecnewtxw&#8221; or &#8220;a place to watch from&#8221; in the henqeminem language, used by members of the Coast Salish Peoples) as a place to monitor activities of the pipeline construction in sensitive ecological and spiritual places. Some defendants were told they could not return to the location that encompassed the Watch House, even though it was not blocking TMX access in any way.</p>
