<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Several limitations of the methodology and approach used in this study should be considered. The primary limitation is the use of 2020 census data to determine the prevalence of each tract from 2003 to 2018. Research has demonstrated the persistence of White&#8211;Black, White&#8211;Hispanic, and White&#8211;Asian segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas through multiple decadal censuses [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This would imply there is likely not significant enough change in the examined demographic makeup of the census tracts used in this study to significantly affect the results. Potentially, the use of ACS data throughout the timeframe would give a better indication of population prevalence within tracts through time. One would take the ACS releases between 2003 and 2018 and correspond them to the years from the SUHI dataset. However, the number of census tracts or their spatial arrangement for a city can change through time (at each decennial census) and this could potentially add a level of complexity to the models that could affect the comparative ability of the results. This study uses only 2020 data so that SUHI intensity trends in the current tracts identified for each representative prevalent population group could be examined. Therefore, these results show SUHI intensity trends in areas that currently (as of 2020) are prevalent with each population group and not necessarily demonstrative of the comprehensive degree of disparate exposure throughout the timeframe. Future spatial temporal studies might look to incorporate five year ACS data&#8212;with consideration of these and other inherent limitations&#8212;and compare to results from this analysis.</p>
