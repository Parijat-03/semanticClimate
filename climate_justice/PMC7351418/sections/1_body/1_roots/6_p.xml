<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0035">The Climate Just Alliance (CJA) takes a more social justice-centric approach to just transition principles, emphasizing the importance of countering structural inequalities. The CJA defines a just transition as set of principles &#8220;that build economic and political power to shift from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy.&#8221; Key to these processes is an emphasis on &#8220;redressing past harms and creating new relationships of power for the future through reparations&#8221; <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this framework, policy paths necessary to ensure an equitable transition are highly contingent on geographical and cultural context and require community buy-in, agency, and empowerment. CJA membership includes a diverse range of organizations, from the Energy Justice Network and the Alliance for Appalachia to the Indigenous Environmental Network and the National Family Farm Coalition. The group outlines eight just transition principles, that emphasize that a just transition &#8220;must actively work against and transform historic social inequities based on race, class, gender, immigrant status, and other forms of oppression&#8221; <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The CJA cites these efforts as critical for working toward a just transition across diverse geographies in the United States and beyond, from communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction to those on the frontlines of climate change.</p>
