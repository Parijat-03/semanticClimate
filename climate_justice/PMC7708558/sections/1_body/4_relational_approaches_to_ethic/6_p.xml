<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par40">Among the identified literature from social and political ecology, ecofeminism is among the most important and influential discourses. Ecofeminism &#8220;seeks to understand the interconnected roots of all domination,&#8221; connecting the oppression and domination of women in particular and marginalized groups in general to the oppression and domination of nature (Plant n.d., p. 101). Plumwood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1993</xref>) connects the logic of domination to dualistic structures of reasoning in Western thought. Male/female, mind/body, civilized/primitive, and human/nature dualisms, she argues, naturalize unequal and exploitative relationships based on the domination of subordinate groups. Other noted ecofeminists like Merchant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1980</xref>) and Shiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">1989</xref>) document how science, technology, and economic development espouse ideas of progress tied to the control and mastery of nature and of women; while spiritually informed ecofeminists such as Ruether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2005</xref>) develop religious responses to these critiques, emphasizing the liberative potential of cultivating feminine principles in society.</p>
