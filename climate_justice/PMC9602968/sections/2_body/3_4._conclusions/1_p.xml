<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As rural communities are distinctly affected by the health impacts of climate change, increased investments are needed to build the capacity of rural LHDs to address cascading impacts to the health and wellbeing of their populations. Funding, human resources, and political challenges faced by rural LHDs limit their capacity to tackle this tremendous and fast-growing public health challenge. Thus, rural-focused funding, cross-jurisdictional shared service arrangements, and state-level support to build rural LHD technical capacity, and research on local impacts and culturally appropriate solutions are urgently needed to increase the climate change and health capacities and capabilities of rural LHDs.</p>
