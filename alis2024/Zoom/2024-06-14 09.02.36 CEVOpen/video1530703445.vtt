00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:34.878
Captions and full transcript. Now we're still working out how this, transcribing works and I think it's not too bad with some parts of it.

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:45.977
But it's. Little bit. Counterproductive with others. So we will, we'll see what we've got.

00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:54.378
Right. We wait just 3 more minutes.

00:00:57.644 --> 00:01:01.644
Did we have a blue tea for you yesterday, Harsaw?

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:07.128
Yes, we did.

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:11.529
We did that's fine. Okay.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:24.428
Right. Hello, Ranu, how are you? We're not normally takes a minute or 2 to connect because she has 2 devices.

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:34.177
Smitchie isn't able to come today. So we'll see what happens, right?

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:44.928
Okay. Do you know, Reno, whether we're expecting other people or not?

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.278
Hello.

00:01:53.678 --> 00:02:02.678
Yes, Nitika Nikita will join and the party that may may or may not join because she is volunteer type of thing.

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:07.328
Right Yes, and, and what about.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:06.127
Currently.

00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:14.077
And I don't have any information, maybe he will come. You need a less.

00:02:13.377 --> 00:02:20.377
Okay, do you, do you have a lab meeting today that you have to

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:26.928
Yes, it was in the morning. It was in the mornings and now it is over. Until half an hour before it was finished.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.227
Oh good. Right.

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:33.577
Okay, so let's see how we go. So we're being recorded. We're doing captioning.

00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:30.328
So.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:41.728
And, The hello Excellent.

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:56.178
So we're at the stage where we, we've recorded most of what we want to put into all of what we want to put into it.

00:02:48.528 --> 00:03:06.528
Simon has written his, very good article. So we've got to get something that, it's up to that sort of standard.

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:19.378
It's full of pictures, right? So that's, very good. We're not going to have people pictures in it because the idea was it was in that article but we will want some diagrams.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:27.427
And in this, but I'll come to the diagrams. And I will have to be responsible for most of the diagrams.

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:32.727
Okay.

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:48.228
Let's try and work out the major components of what we're doing. we'll go over what we've recorded and we'll label them.

00:03:42.028 --> 00:04:03.028
And so on. But, before we do that, Has anybody got any problems, any bugs, any comments, any new exciting discoveries.

00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:06.727
We'll come to Harshal after that. Yeah.

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:21.378
No bugs, okay. Right. Okay. Marshall, can you, I'm going to hand the screen over to you.

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:29.677
Can you talk us through what you've done with hugging face and, summarization.

00:04:30.528 --> 00:04:31.528
Okay.

00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:36.927
Is that okay?

00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:39.128
Yes, Peter.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:47.478
Good, okay. And don't you know, you're, you're among friends, so don't worry if anything, doesn't work out 1st time.

00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:51.232
Sure.

00:04:52.028 --> 00:05:03.028
So you're telling a story, give us at the beginning, it's a good idea with stories that you tell people what you're going to tell them, right?

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:10.127
So a brief summary, 2 3 sentences, this is what I'm going to show you so that we know where we are.

00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:18.478
And then you give the message and at the end you then summarize by saying this is what we looked at.

00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:14.128
Okay.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.778
And it's summed up in the model motto.

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:29.478
Tell them what you're going to tell them. Tell him, tell him what you told them, right?

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:36.077
Okay. And it's, so tell us what, what we're going to see.

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.127
Okay.

00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:39.427
In overview.

00:05:40.677 --> 00:05:52.677
So it would be from the beginnings. Yes, go after the transcript after the transcript. You can read it from the zoom and yeah.

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:46.428
Huh.

00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:50.927
Well, no, no.

00:05:49.827 --> 00:06:21.827
So it's Hong Kong is going to say something like, Hi. Explored summarization of our transcripts using hugging face summarize or whatever it is right so that's what you're going to tell us right and and then you might put in a thing to say we're going to see the installation of the transformer then it's customization.

00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:00.627
Hmm.

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:32.378
Then it's use on an example. Okay. So that's a sort of, introduction.

00:06:33.128 --> 00:06:39.128
Okay. Does that make sense? Right. Yes.

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.527
Good.

00:06:38.378 --> 00:06:40.378
Okay. Kind of tutorial. Yeah.

00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:55.652
Right, so the task at hand was, can we come up with a good summarization for the long transcript text that we have and for that I explored.

00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:56.728
PM?

00:06:55.645 --> 00:07:03.645
2 different approaches that I'm gonna later explain that users having faced transformers which are again open source.

00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:12.878
We And, right, I'll jump into the 1st one. Which was done using a transformer called Bart.

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:12.028
Yeah.

00:07:12.128 --> 00:07:22.128
And before jumping into that, I can give an overview of what the 2. Broad types of summarization are that I have each tried.

00:07:21.577 --> 00:07:32.577
The 1st one is called extractive summarization. Where the idea is that you compress the long text that you have.

00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:39.828
Without changing the wording. So let's say. You have a thousand word document you want to summarize it.

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:52.828
No, the way you will do it is not by paraphrasing or by you know using your own deduction or reasoning to paraphrase to you know get to the crux of the document.

00:07:52.628 --> 00:08:06.628
How it is done is that it takes the sentences present in the document largely and it you know compresses that So that is the 1st and that is called extractive summarization.

00:08:06.628 --> 00:08:14.628
Conversely the second type of summarization is called abstractor summarization where it's just the opposite.

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:22.629
Where, rather than compressing the text itself. The idea is that the model generates text.

00:08:21.878 --> 00:08:33.878
New text that is supposed to be a good summarization for the text. So, we look at both of them.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:43.645
This one is for abstractive summarization. The 1st part is obviously installing all the necessary packages.

00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:47.828
And my screen is visible, right?

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:53.879
Brilliant. That was an excellent introduction, really good.

00:08:50.677 --> 00:08:52.677
Great.

00:08:54.528 --> 00:09:09.528
Thank you. And so this is the bad model that I mentioned which performs abstractive summarization. So here the challenge or the Oh, the particular challenge of us is that our document is long, right?

00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:23.327
And these transformers at 1 point they can only take 500 words as an input. So one part of the pre-processing is to divide the long document into 500.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:38.779
Oh, word long, chunks or passages. And the workflow is that the model summarizes these 500 word long passages.

00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:53.646
And coll that and the other the another process on top of that is that it takes those summaries on top of that is that it takes those summaries, concatenates them and generates a summary on top of that.

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:58.827
So like there are 2. Different types of outputs.

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:12.127
So I can give an example, I can show how it looks like. So if the If it's visible here, so it says that, it is divided by text into 56 passages.

00:10:05.827 --> 00:10:06.827
I'm absolutely.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:18.629
56, 500 word long passages. And

00:10:16.645 --> 00:10:23.645
Quick question, when you say the text, is this a 500 word text or is it the whole lot?

00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:29.177
The text refers to the transcript and the chunks of the passages refer to the 500 word longer.

00:10:29.778 --> 00:10:32.778
It's subdivisions that we're doing.

00:10:31.228 --> 00:10:45.228
Right and and so there are altogether then 2,800 words 56 by 2, by 500.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:48.529
28,000.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:53.646
56. Great, 56 into 500. Approximately.

00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:56.828
Yeah, so that's that's 28,000.

00:10:56.677 --> 00:10:58.677
Right.

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:03.079
Right, okay, and is that all of our transcripts?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:11.430
No, this is just one of the transcript. The name is, I can look that up.

00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:18.877
Okay, this is very, very good, right?

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:25.646
It's called meeting saved closed caption. So like I just took one of them for experimenting.

00:11:23.628 --> 00:11:32.628
Yes, we need to now, the next thing we have to do immediately afterwards is give these decent labels, but that's fine.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:38.979
Right. So as you can see like for each of the chunks it generates a summary.

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:48.029
So for example, We have separate channels and slack for different types of discussion. This is the summary for this particular.

00:11:47.028 --> 00:12:04.028
Chunk the 500 word long chunk and, I, another step, what it also does is that it takes all of the summaries generated, concatenates them and generates a summary.

00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:11.929
Of that. So a summary of summaries. And that is.

00:12:07.878 --> 00:12:09.878
Yes.

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:20.029
That is shown here. But that was not very good. So like that was that didn't come out to be very good.

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:29.879
So final somebody which other somebody or somebody uses. Summarizes uses tools from zoom and slack. We record videos which have an audio stream in them.

00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:29.429
Yep.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:35.879
So it's not very useful. Like from experiments

00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:44.129
How long is, these summaries, how many words are they, they take 500 words are they, they take 500 words and condense them into what lengths.

00:12:43.528 --> 00:12:49.528
The maximum length is 500 by 6, which like which is a hyper parameter I said.

00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:59.578
So, 500 by 6 would be approximately 125 1 30 words. That is the maximum length that I have said.

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:05.478
So you're condensing. 500 words into 1 30 words.

00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:09.128
Yes, a maximum of 1 30.

00:13:07.128 --> 00:13:13.128
Right. Yes. Excellent.

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:19.928
Do you vote flow for the? Sorry.

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:17.278
And then you

00:13:17.278 --> 00:13:38.278
No, and then you're taking all of those. 56, chunks of 1 30 words and, turning them into a single And that but it's making a single final summary.

00:13:32.928 --> 00:13:35.928
I'm writing it to the text file. Yeah.

00:13:38.428 --> 00:13:41.428
So how long is the single final summary?

00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:45.777
The single final summary was in 2 grade. It was just one line.

00:13:45.578 --> 00:13:58.578
Summarizes using tool from zoom in slack per record videos which have an audio stream we publish all this material record then the transcript onto slide this last for a period over 2 months.

00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:50.878
Yeah, that's no use to it. Yes. Yes.

00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:54.928
That's right.

00:13:55.278 --> 00:14:08.278
So I don't know what went wrong there maybe. Something went wrong but yeah like this is the current how it looks.

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:09.428
Right. So. One of the things is that.

00:14:09.377 --> 00:14:20.377
Whenever you do something like this 1st time, It usually goes wrong and you repeat exactly what you did or you think you did.

00:14:13.828 --> 00:14:28.828
And then it starts getting better. So 1st time through, always with things like this you can expect.

00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:34.177
You know to get something that isn't right.

00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:32.577
Okay.

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:45.646
And the workflow for a second one is exactly the same. It is just that we use it different transformer to shift from abstractive to extractive.

00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:53.827
So, if Peter, you remember, yes, and you were saying that the summary. Sounds like a 3rd person overview.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:15:12.130
So that is that is a function of that the that is a component of it being summarized using abstractive summarization because like you are generating new lines, paraphrasing, the original content.

00:14:55.377 --> 00:14:57.377
Yes.

00:15:10.647 --> 00:15:15.647
So it looks like a 3rd person has read it and you know given a summary in their own words.

00:15:17.027 --> 00:15:26.027
Right. I wondered whether, so when you gave it to chat GPT, presumably you gave it some sort of prompt.

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.627
Yes.

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:47.527
And I wondered whether the prompt had, influenced that. In other words, I you said please summarize this and Chatchi PT took summarized to mean write a review of it rather than you know, abstract the meaning in the same style.

00:15:46.527 --> 00:15:58.527
Probably. I used a very simple problem that said like your Like, a very simple problem. Where they are like changing the prompt influences.

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:54.029
Yes.

00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:57.979
Yeah.

00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:09.978
The output I could, you know, specify, perform extracted summarization and then it probably would stick to performing extractor summarization.

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:20.778
Okay, that's tremendous. Now, can we have, Svia, Reno and, and ask you questions.

00:16:21.577 --> 00:16:25.577
Do you understand this? What's happened here?

00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:37.078
Yes, Peter, I got this some some not completely but that.

00:16:39.428 --> 00:16:41.428
Shafia, what about you?

00:16:43.227 --> 00:16:49.227
Yeah, I got it, but. Same, I mean, little confused.

00:16:48.527 --> 00:16:50.527
Right, and part yet?

00:16:52.527 --> 00:16:56.527
Alright, I think I understand how like it's generating.

00:16:57.378 --> 00:17:08.378
Right, you don't have to understand the. Deep mechanics of it, and what type of network it is, and so on.

00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:20.077
But you have to understand. What the input is, what the expected output is. And then we've got to work out whether it's worth while.

00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:33.928
So. You think it condenses from 500 to a hundred 30 okay Did you feel those?

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:41.677
130 word summaries. And, gel were useful.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:56.228
So I tried, 2 different versions, one by specifying the maximum length as it is, 1 50 words and the other without any without a hard encoding rate.

00:17:55.428 --> 00:18:07.428
But in that case, like it turned out to be very long the document. So like I didn't share it because I felt the other one which uses 150 as the maximum words.

00:18:09.078 --> 00:18:17.078
Give better result according to like my skimming of the output.

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:24.278
Right, okay. That's very, very useful. And indeed, we'll need to think about it.

00:18:18.729 --> 00:18:37.729
You're showing us code here. Is that taken from, tutorials, so that, or have you had to write that?

00:18:37.028 --> 00:18:49.028
So for obstructive summarization, I got the code from a blog that he had put out of video also explaining what he's doing and like there are links above.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:57.828
And for the extractive component, I just had to change the what the model is doing. So I did that myself.

00:18:56.278 --> 00:19:07.278
Right. Okay. We, we will have to find out, how useful this is.

00:19:06.077 --> 00:19:14.077
And I think Probably. You're all.

00:19:13.678 --> 00:19:22.678
All of you should have a look and see whether these. 130 word summaries are useful.

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:37.228
And, when that's going to help. My feeling is that given this, the way that you've had to divide it into 500

00:19:36.528 --> 00:19:55.528
What chunks is actually better for us to chunk it because it has been the talk has been given on the basis that it's fairly well structured and I think our task is going to go through and turn it into chunks and then we might.

00:19:52.427 --> 00:20:08.427
Repeat on that because your chunks are may overlap 2 concepts or it may not be enough for one concept or something of that sort.

00:20:09.277 --> 00:20:17.277
Okay. And another thing I tried which like did not, like I could not get the results until now is that.

00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:10.327
Does that make sense?

00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:13.827
Yep.

00:20:15.677 --> 00:20:26.677
Initially I tried it using Ch GPT, right? And. So then the better step was to try an open source, language model.

00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:35.028
So I'm I'm working on that code to generate a summary using. An open source language model.

00:20:34.428 --> 00:20:48.428
That could give a better result Lexi because it has a Hi, it has a bigger amount of words that it can process at a single time.

00:20:49.877 --> 00:20:56.877
So like for transformers it is 500 so for that it is 1,000 or in some cases even more.

00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:52.128
That's

00:20:58.027 --> 00:21:04.027
Excellent. And, what are the resource requirements for this?

00:21:03.377 --> 00:21:16.377
That one requires GPU resources. So like yesterday I was trying it out on Kaggle like Kaggle offers certain minimum, GPU.

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.527
Clouds. So I was trying it on that.

00:21:21.378 --> 00:21:26.378
And, do they offer that free or do you have to pay?

00:21:26.227 --> 00:21:37.227
Good. I should say, to everybody that we don't want any of you to, start paying any money for anything.

00:21:26.879 --> 00:21:28.879
That one is free.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:53.378
I accept for your connection charges. We can't do anything about that. NIPGR has, you know, installed a powerful, GPU machine.

00:21:53.879 --> 00:22:01.879
I don't know what the load Renew, do you have any feeling for how that machine is used?

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:08.079
No, no, Peter. We have no information. It is there. Good day.

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:19.479
Yes. So that's a possibility. And that's is almost certainly, up to, to manage.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:27.839
He's done very, very well in, you know, getting this. purchased and installed.

00:22:26.028 --> 00:22:33.028
You know, and what you're doing, what we're doing, so this is a team effort.

00:22:32.379 --> 00:23:03.379
Is maybe very very useful for some of the core business of the institute you can imagine For example, getting a, report from another government institute on, let's say, the, Management of crops or something like that and asking these tools to summarize it.

00:23:01.328 --> 00:23:11.328
You know, and Possibly summarize it with, relevance to an IPGRs, core.

00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:15.645
Disciplines. Does that make sense?

00:23:18.228 --> 00:23:20.228
Yes, it does. Yeah.

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:38.479
Because I think, you know, the traditional reports and the scientific literature are vastly underused and and it may well be possible, say, if you've got an institute which produces, I don't know, let's say.

00:23:38.179 --> 00:23:54.179
A thousand page a thousand pages of report a year something like that you can see saying what does this institute and you know these will be publicly available you know these will be public available you know can you summarize this institute and you know these will be public available.

00:23:45.327 --> 00:24:06.327
You know, these will be public available. You know, can you summarize this and can you find out, you know, can you summarize this and can you find out, whether and it is particularly involved with genomics or with invasive species or whatever it might be.

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:13.479
So. This is pioneering work, Castle and I think that's.

00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:16.879
Very exciting indeed, so.

00:24:16.628 --> 00:24:34.628
Right, so the message from this, now, that we need to section our our transcripts, along the lines of what we have, already done.

00:24:34.328 --> 00:24:45.328
But we need to actually put that sectioning in the transcript. And that would make it easier to summarize.

00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:53.645
How long does it, Take to run a hospital and Do you have a limited amount of resources?

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:56.727
On

00:24:58.427 --> 00:25:10.427
Table has a limited resources for the free tier of GPUs that it provides. And then at the later iterations of the model it was crashing.

00:25:11.978 --> 00:25:16.978
But this one, the transfer based one, there I'm perfectly fine. I ran it on Google.

00:25:17.178 --> 00:25:23.178
Right, okay. So it's offered in Google Calab, is it?

00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:43.828
Google. I've also, it also offers 3 GPUs up to up to a limit but in my experience Cagle offers a much more It offers more compute at for the free tier list.

00:25:44.027 --> 00:25:59.027
Right. Okay. One small thing. Can you explain the difference between Bart and Bert's because they're, when we speak about them, it's easy to confuse them.

00:26:00.228 --> 00:26:02.228
Great.

00:26:06.978 --> 00:26:18.978
At a broad overview level. BART is a encoded with I love I might I don't want to get this wrong

00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:30.227
So there is a difference in the architecture of the models that enables it to perform certain tasks, right?

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:41.877
So bird for example. Usually it is used for let's say classification. Or you know outputting something that is a label or like a short output.

00:26:41.178 --> 00:26:53.178
Compare that to but which is you know pre trained to generate text so like for that for that purpose it is used for abstracted summarization where you know it can generate text.

00:26:41.644 --> 00:26:45.644
Right Yep.

00:26:54.478 --> 00:27:04.478
And a much more robust way compared to Bert where like internally it is just compressing the texts and then not particularly generating it.

00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:19.578
That's very useful. Okay. I believe, that, is used as a basis of a number of the, Texts tools that we've used already.

00:27:18.377 --> 00:27:30.377
In Docker analysis and so on that I think there and and there are quite a lot of But specialities where it's something, right?

00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:39.528
Good. So for example, biotech is pre-trained on you know abstracts of biomedical literature.

00:27:31.527 --> 00:27:34.527
And the

00:27:38.879 --> 00:27:52.879
And a different bird, let's say, is. Pre-trained on documents that are particularly financial let's say so like a lot of different Specializations exist.

00:27:53.828 --> 00:28:02.828
Which is owing to the. Going to what type of corporate or what type of ex it has been 3 trained on

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:14.378
Right. Good, okay. So, Okay, we'll draw a section here in the discussion.

00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:24.328
So what what I think we're going to need to do is to give some verbal comments which can be used to section up the discussion.

00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:42.827
So this is end of partial machine learning AI section and now we'll move on to a completely different subject which is human sectioning of what we have already got.

00:28:42.077 --> 00:28:55.077
Now. We're going to do this in mark down and mark down is going to be the primary tool that we use to create something.

00:28:56.577 --> 00:29:06.577
So, Nitika, Parjat, Strabia, have you all, explored marked down?

00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:17.644
I, I used to, learn basic support the markdown. So I knew few.

00:29:20.128 --> 00:29:24.128
I mean, how to write the markdown. So I try it.

00:29:23.278 --> 00:29:25.278
Good. A parent chat?

00:29:26.028 --> 00:29:32.028
I have exploded it, not quite, easy with it, but I have seen it.

00:29:32.727 --> 00:29:34.727
Nichiko?

00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:47.645
Oh, I also have had some experience with Mark down so I'm comfortable. Being yeah you think you're talking

00:29:43.127 --> 00:29:45.127
Good.

00:29:44.927 --> 00:29:51.927
And Anne Mole, you've just joined us, so welcome.

00:29:51.428 --> 00:30:05.428
We've just had a, a session on machine learning AI from Harcel who's done an absolutely brilliant job in Introducing us to this.

00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:12.628
And you should certainly go back and look at that recording if you missed some of it. So, Have you?

00:30:13.427 --> 00:30:17.427
Got experience with marked down.

00:30:17.527 --> 00:30:29.527
Yeah, 1st of all, I've been here in the meeting since like last 30 30 min.

00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:35.927
Excellent. That's fine. Well, well done. Okay.

00:30:30.877 --> 00:30:33.877
Yeah.

00:30:33.878 --> 00:30:49.878
So, we will create markdown in our transcripts here. So we'll come up with, Each session we've done.

00:30:49.777 --> 00:31:03.777
We will give an ID to and we will then put in major sections and gradually make them minor.

00:31:02.377 --> 00:31:13.377
And section subsections, there will be one or 2 places with tables. And, and We will do this as a communal activity.

00:31:14.527 --> 00:31:16.527
So.

00:31:16.277 --> 00:31:23.277
This is an experiment that we've, done. I don't know whether it's going to work out.

00:31:24.627 --> 00:31:34.627
I think it probably will. But the more that you can help as a community, the better. So, I,

00:31:36.827 --> 00:31:39.827
Let me. Share my screen.

00:31:52.177 --> 00:32:15.177
Okay, you can see my screen, now. And this is one particular analysis, and I've given it the, title of 2 0 2 4 0 6 13 which is the date Ranganathon, right?

00:32:14.227 --> 00:32:27.227
And that probably should be renamed. So giving identifiers is really valuable and in this case we will give them semantic identifiers.

00:32:25.827 --> 00:32:40.827
So I have put them in a repository here. Called semantic climate this is our communal, repository, isn't it?

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:48.627
Renew. When there's

00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:51.377
You know, this is, this is the different, I think. Maybe you can share because in the US system.

00:32:51.977 --> 00:32:57.977
Well, I, it's on my machine, but I think it is, the,

00:32:53.127 --> 00:32:55.127
So it is yours.

00:32:54.827 --> 00:33:05.827
Yeah, if it is yours then it is it will be the for all like, but if it is the assignments like Simon I create another one.

00:33:06.977 --> 00:33:11.977
Well, I think we will find that. Let's see what it is.

00:33:07.177 --> 00:33:09.177
Plus the winter climate.

00:33:11.827 --> 00:33:14.827
If you come in and if you can see that then

00:33:15.777 --> 00:33:18.777
So.

00:33:23.477 --> 00:33:25.477
If it is gonna work space.

00:33:24.428 --> 00:33:29.428
Oh, I see. It's Not.

00:33:30.027 --> 00:33:37.027
It's such a complicated project. And we didn't know the structure at the beginning.

00:33:38.577 --> 00:33:44.577
That yes, I think I have Conf. So this is actually

00:33:45.877 --> 00:33:55.877
I think this is actually mine here. Now the semantic climate

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.827
Yes, yes.

00:33:56.727 --> 00:34:05.727
The whole semantic climate. Oh, ownership, let's have a look at this.

00:34:08.577 --> 00:34:09.577
Yeah, this one.

00:34:10.727 --> 00:34:19.727
That's not me. We will. That's me, yes, but, I was trying to put them in,

00:34:13.644 --> 00:34:15.644
No, if you.

00:34:21.077 --> 00:34:27.077
The one that I think

00:34:25.427 --> 00:34:29.427
This is not the the one we are talking about.

00:34:30.427 --> 00:34:32.427
But this is.

00:34:32.078 --> 00:34:37.078
Yeah, the one you're here. This is yours.

00:34:38.078 --> 00:34:45.078
Yes, the name is different. It has it contains all the repository of glossary IPCC.

00:34:38.227 --> 00:34:40.227
But this is on github.com.

00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:50.878
And.

00:34:47.027 --> 00:35:02.027
Yes. So I would. So I would suggest, so you've got, yeah, this is a, we've got discussions here on this repository we have been

00:35:07.728 --> 00:35:25.728
That's misnamed. I tried to rename it. This is where I have been creating, the discussion here, of our Yes.

00:35:22.778 --> 00:35:25.778
Table of content.

00:35:23.327 --> 00:35:35.327
So this is not on my GitHub. This is on communal gitub, is that right?

00:35:36.645 --> 00:35:43.645
This is owned by the semantic climate project. Okay, so.

00:35:39.928 --> 00:35:43.928
Yes, yes.

00:35:53.644 --> 00:36:01.644
This is I don't know whether we're going to be able to do this. Easily, communally.

00:35:58.077 --> 00:36:09.077
So you may see me struggling a little bit with this because I know what's going on here roughly.

00:36:10.478 --> 00:36:16.478
But we've had a number of.

00:36:16.477 --> 00:36:23.477
Maybe 3 of us can do like, and you and me. While others.

00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:32.927
Well, what I want is everybody to see, what's happening unless there are clear tasks that we can give people at the moment.

00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:35.827
Do you think that there are clear tasks?

00:36:33.528 --> 00:36:35.528
Hmm, yes, yes.

00:36:37.727 --> 00:36:41.727
Clear task has not got it right now because

00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:50.677
No. So I think it may be a bit boring for people, but it will be a very good introduction on how you deal with.

00:36:42.644 --> 00:36:53.644
A very good introduction on how you deal with. A very good introduction on how you deal with, complex projects.

00:36:50.277 --> 00:37:08.277
And, if you've got ideas. Be very, me happy to suggest them, but also, expect that, you might find that they're not acceptable to the structure.

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:20.178
We've already got at the moment. This is such a complex project that, you know, my brain is, struggling to manage all of this.

00:37:19.227 --> 00:37:32.227
So what I'm going to do on this one. Is, have you had any more, feedback from GitHub.

00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:35.427
Renew.

00:37:35.278 --> 00:37:40.278
No Peter, nothing, no emails have reverted that.

00:37:39.127 --> 00:37:43.127
Right, has anybody else, contributed to GitHub?

00:37:44.877 --> 00:37:46.877
Life.

00:37:46.077 --> 00:38:01.077
Well, what I mean is we've lost Harshaw, but we need to be putting this stuff up on GitHub and I wondered if GitHub had, blocked anybody else's account.

00:37:58.377 --> 00:38:06.377
I mean, nobody is trying to take a risk. So that is the reason that nobody has tried it.

00:38:06.177 --> 00:38:08.177
I see, well,

00:38:07.428 --> 00:38:12.428
Yeah, because I did it with the 2 account and the same test, same transcript.

00:38:14.527 --> 00:38:21.527
The it has did this another account it was also banned. Okay, they already checked.

00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.827
Right, well.

00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:29.077
Right, so it's happened to you twice. Right.

00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:27.977
Hmm.

00:38:27.077 --> 00:38:35.077
I'm just waiting and otherwise I'll have to ask someone else to, generate with their email.

00:38:35.177 --> 00:38:47.177
I didn't need to have account and give it to me so that I can use it for the website and for doing the semantics, It's called, the.

00:38:45.227 --> 00:38:53.227
Right, okay. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to assume that I can continue to contribute to discussions.

00:38:53.977 --> 00:38:56.977
So,

00:38:57.027 --> 00:38:59.027
Yeah.

00:38:57.228 --> 00:39:06.228
I'm going to add a comment at the bottom here. Where I put a list of all of the.

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:12.977
Transcripts that we've got.

00:39:25.577 --> 00:39:27.577
And

00:39:35.327 --> 00:39:46.327
We'll go over these transcripts and we will. Decide whether they're useful and we will label them.

00:39:46.227 --> 00:40:02.227
It may be mainly me talking. But it will be us doing the work together. Okay. So, it may be a bit boring, but, trust me, we will come up with something useful at the end.

00:40:01.478 --> 00:40:17.478
So. We'll go back in the slack. To find, all the transcripts, by the way, are, safe on my machine and their backed up and so on.

00:40:18.778 --> 00:40:20.778
And.

00:40:20.077 --> 00:40:31.077
If we can find somewhere to back them up, which is not GitHub. Then, we should do that, because that will make, them safe.

00:40:32.077 --> 00:40:40.077
But, at the moment we'll work on What we've got.

00:40:41.528 --> 00:40:54.528
And try and give it. Crown represent the overall. Thing here So there will be periods of silence when I think, okay.

00:41:09.527 --> 00:41:14.527
So we're going to go back to our slack. Slack doesn't.

00:41:16.927 --> 00:41:21.927
Last for a very long period.

00:41:50.877 --> 00:41:52.877
So.

00:41:51.927 --> 00:42:01.927
It may be that you can help by also looking at your copy. Of the slack here and decide.

00:42:03.027 --> 00:42:07.027
Where we want to go back to.

00:42:10.377 --> 00:42:19.377
That. It looks like it's not a good idea to host raw text into slack.

00:42:25.377 --> 00:42:28.377
Right, so we're getting to the.

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:07.677
I don't know why it suddenly flipped back to March, but you can see by the way here that we can't get back beyond.

00:43:06.127 --> 00:43:16.127
That it's You have to pay huge amounts of money. You've probably got to pay.

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:26.077
I don't know something like, $10,000 a month to slack. It is huge.

00:43:53.427 --> 00:44:03.427
I will go back and try and label all of these but the impression is that

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:12.277
I don't know why. Why it's taken us back so far.

00:44:16.727 --> 00:44:19.727
It'll be late May somewhere.

00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:38.527
Right, I've tried to give, an idea here, so that's,

00:45:21.178 --> 00:45:24.178
We're still doing software at that stage.

00:45:31.227 --> 00:45:39.227
I would like better and more open systems. Can you see how useful this is? As a record of what we've done.

00:45:38.727 --> 00:45:47.727
It's not perfect. But, It's allows us to go back. 2 or 3 months.

00:45:56.477 --> 00:45:58.477
Yeah.

00:46:56.127 --> 00:46:58.127
Still doing Gatsby and stuff.

00:47:33.077 --> 00:47:37.077
Right. And. It's still.

00:47:55.577 --> 00:48:03.577
What we are now, this is. 2 weeks ago. So yes, so this is where we start looking for it.

00:48:12.178 --> 00:48:25.178
Hiashan. Can you see How exciting it is to have all our collaborators creating things.

00:48:28.127 --> 00:48:34.127
So we may very well come back and.

00:48:37.628 --> 00:48:42.628
Excession to very boring. Okay.

00:48:45.377 --> 00:48:50.377
I'm going to start. Noing these.

00:48:56.127 --> 00:49:01.127
No, we can go back. They're not going to disappear yet.

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:10.079
Components of a dictionary might be valuable, so Let's go back Monday, June the 3.rd

00:49:28.277 --> 00:49:30.277
I've lost my

00:49:33.927 --> 00:49:38.927
Believe that on here and we go back to. The repository

00:49:50.478 --> 00:49:53.478
Actually, have bookmarks for this, but I don't.

00:50:10.227 --> 00:50:13.227
Right side, right side, yes, L is in structure.

00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:16.177
Yes. That's right. Well done.

00:50:41.977 --> 00:50:47.977
What was it? It was said again. Okay.

00:51:08.477 --> 00:51:10.477
Then we got a.

00:51:18.327 --> 00:51:25.327
Right, so this one. Session one we have. Mainly.

00:51:44.027 --> 00:51:50.027
Right, so I have presented this. So I'm going to.

00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:20.828
That's June the 4.th Yeah.

00:52:37.928 --> 00:52:43.928
That's not what I wanted at all. Oh, my to me, yes it is, okay.

00:52:59.177 --> 00:53:01.177
Alright.

00:53:12.529 --> 00:53:19.529
This is making me feel much happier, right? You may all think that it's

00:53:27.927 --> 00:53:29.927
Boring.

00:53:34.727 --> 00:53:36.727
Right, so this.

00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:45.877
Between the 5th

00:54:01.877 --> 00:54:14.877
And you can see that what we need is a button where slack post it directly to this but it.

00:54:15.727 --> 00:54:19.727
You probably have to pay a lot of money for that.

00:54:39.827 --> 00:54:57.827
And we need to get the transcript somewhere. And When you when you got blocked Reno were you posting this to discussion or were you posting it to a Reported.

00:54:55.077 --> 00:55:01.077
This discussion 12 discussion number 12 I have created the discussion number 12.

00:55:01.627 --> 00:55:06.627
Right. And, it did it when you posted something in, is that right?

00:55:08.227 --> 00:55:13.227
I paste all the transmit, the big chunk, the long.

00:55:08.927 --> 00:55:22.927
Right, I think, I think probably. I think that that was what the problem was. Okay. So I don't think people should pass transcripts.

00:55:19.177 --> 00:55:21.177
Hmm.

00:55:21.777 --> 00:55:44.777
Large things to discussions because what they probably think is that you are trying to spam it. So yes, I, so we will create or use a repository where We put our transcripts in the GitHub repository and not What?

00:55:24.678 --> 00:55:26.678
In discussion. Hmm.

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.328
Yes.

00:55:44.678 --> 00:55:54.678
Yes, as a exactly. And I think that Yeah. Good. Well, I'm sorry it's happened to you.

00:55:46.127 --> 00:55:54.127
As a test file. Yes, as it as it. Thanks. While we upload that file.

00:55:53.777 --> 00:56:03.777
And, yeah, that makes sense. that. Posting these transcripts is not a good idea.

00:56:05.278 --> 00:56:15.278
On discussion things okay so that's June here. The 5.th

00:56:39.128 --> 00:56:48.128
Right, so we had session one on one day and session 2 on. Another day. And

00:56:52.878 --> 00:56:54.878
And we will take that.

00:57:18.277 --> 00:57:25.277
I'm going to go on until I've got this summarized and then we will have a a break for tea.

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:29.643
Okay.

00:57:31.427 --> 00:57:33.427
So that captures everything.

00:57:38.327 --> 00:57:40.327
Yeah, I think that's captured that.

00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:02.727
So we're now on Friday, is that right?

00:58:05.327 --> 00:58:07.327
No, it still says Thursday.

00:59:29.878 --> 00:59:31.878
Now the 11.th

00:59:37.127 --> 00:59:40.127
This is a session on Monday.

00:59:43.645 --> 00:59:53.645
That was. The. Mainly, debug, mainly software.

00:59:52.777 --> 00:59:56.777
And Peter, we have a holiday on Monday.

00:59:58.327 --> 01:00:00.327
We do some festival.

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:05.728
Okay, that's thanks very much for letting us know.

01:00:04.778 --> 01:00:16.778
If anyone is interested, you can continue with them. Meeting. I have the holder so I cannot come to the lab but others can join if they are happy to join on line.

01:00:09.128 --> 01:00:11.128
Yes. Yeah.

01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:15.278
No.

01:00:16.378 --> 01:00:24.378
That means that choose i've got to try and get most of this together for Tuesday right

01:00:25.027 --> 01:00:27.027
Hmm, yes.

01:00:26.227 --> 01:00:34.227
And Tuesday we should. Let's work out what the days are.

01:00:34.527 --> 01:00:51.527
She says the 18, th right? Till 20, th right, okay. But I think I can't, I, Do you have any idea whether this is a hard deadline?

01:00:38.227 --> 01:00:41.227
18.th We have the deadline till 20.th

01:00:43.977 --> 01:00:45.977
You know.

01:00:51.577 --> 01:00:55.577
In other words, they're not going to cut off software.

01:00:51.827 --> 01:01:02.827
You already expect I think the I don't know about that but It is already expanded after 31st May to June 20.th

01:00:56.927 --> 01:00:59.927
They've extended it, but I think

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:13.927
I know. I will tell them that we're in the process of submitting it. And So.

01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:06.177
After that I didn't.

01:01:10.078 --> 01:01:19.078
Sending the reminder to others. Cool. I'm sending the reminder to others who are supposed to submit.

01:01:18.628 --> 01:01:28.628
Oh, you are. Oh, well done. Okay. Right, well, we'll, we'll get something in.

01:01:19.827 --> 01:01:22.827
Hmm.

01:01:23.477 --> 01:01:28.477
Okay. Okay, you can continue.

01:01:31.477 --> 01:01:33.477
Hmm.

01:01:33.677 --> 01:01:39.677
So this is top level narrative, June the 11.th

01:03:48.427 --> 01:03:52.427
And then there was that's on the. What date is that?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.926
That's on the 11.th

01:04:43.277 --> 01:04:48.277
This is probably also true of Slack that we shouldn't paste huge things into Slack.

01:04:54.777 --> 01:05:01.777
But it was not, in the slide, it was a text file only. It was the text file is uploaded in the slack.

01:05:04.027 --> 01:05:09.027
Yes, this is probably okay, actually. They They seem to allow it.

01:05:04.645 --> 01:05:07.645
This is the view viewing, yes.

01:05:09.428 --> 01:05:11.428
Hmm.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.427
So wait a minute.

01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:37.828
Wednesday.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:42.327
Maybe.

01:05:46.277 --> 01:05:55.277
Good I did I post? There's nothing in there, right? I think I I had to rush off in Wednesday.

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:57.827
Do you remember that?

01:05:57.528 --> 01:06:04.528
I had a guest. Right. I know. Yes, and I think I record.

01:05:58.377 --> 01:06:09.377
Yes, you're going to the, I think. Okay. 15 min session was there 15 and a half an hour.

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:07.530
Okay, so that's a very

01:06:09.228 --> 01:06:17.228
Yeah, yes, okay. So we need to post. Something into

01:06:09.627 --> 01:06:10.627
Hmm.

01:06:20.278 --> 01:06:23.278
I'm not sure whether it's possible to

01:06:25.828 --> 01:06:27.828
Edit this.

01:06:31.027 --> 01:06:34.027
I need to leave for lunch.

01:06:31.128 --> 01:06:43.128
Off you go, off you do. You're all doing brilliantly. When I finish this, I think we'll finish for the day.

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:41.827
She on Tuesday.

01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:49.777
I think I just need to go down and. So are you happy for us to work for another?

01:06:48.627 --> 01:06:58.627
10 min from now get this. Sorted, okay. So I'm Yes.

01:06:50.577 --> 01:06:59.577
Okay. Yes, yes, I am here. Yeah, you can go off and not also.

01:07:03.977 --> 01:07:05.977
I'm going to edit this.

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:44.427
That's 12. Okay, that's fine.

01:07:57.977 --> 01:07:59.977
Right, so that's Wednesday.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:07.977
And this, manuscript production will be important.

01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:45.577
I'm not going to edit it. That's wrong.

01:09:46.827 --> 01:09:49.827
Sorry, I'm putting it into slack.

01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:59.027
It's still pushing it into Slack. So that's.

01:10:26.478 --> 01:10:31.478
And. I will go through and.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:40.027
And give all of these things. Name so that we can then put it put them in the right order.

01:10:56.077 --> 01:11:08.077
And I'm going to write a top level article from this. Covering everything we want. Which will be converted into the PDF.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:15.177
I don't think we can use automatic tools at this stage. This will just be me going through everything here.

01:11:16.177 --> 01:11:21.177
I'm writing some narrative in this. The

01:11:19.077 --> 01:11:25.077
Yes, so we will be sending them in the gold document. So maybe they are going to convert it into the.

01:11:23.677 --> 01:11:32.677
Oh yeah, a word. We'll put it in word, but this will be me sticking it together with all of us looking to make sure that.

01:11:27.677 --> 01:11:32.677
Hmm. Okay.

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:37.644
It's,

01:11:39.627 --> 01:11:42.627
It's correct. Has it been?

01:11:43.645 --> 01:11:45.645
Okay.

01:11:46.877 --> 01:11:49.877
So that I think

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:06.527
I'm gonna save that. I don't know what's happened to the recordings, but

01:12:09.327 --> 01:12:11.327
I don't think they got uploaded.

01:12:11.128 --> 01:12:20.128
And do it again. Huh. Oh, wait a minute.

01:12:18.777 --> 01:12:26.777
Wait a minute. I've got to save it. It's at the bottom of it.

01:12:22.227 --> 01:12:24.227
Okay.

01:12:25.727 --> 01:12:28.727
Click on the green button.

01:12:28.028 --> 01:12:30.028
And.

01:12:33.727 --> 01:12:36.727
Where maybe they.

01:12:35.878 --> 01:12:45.878
Maybe that. It appears to be in the end. Right, okay, so this has got to be edited.

01:12:39.227 --> 01:12:41.227
Put it in the end.

01:12:40.977 --> 01:12:47.977
So this is

01:12:43.477 --> 01:12:49.477
Yeah. Hmm.

01:12:51.777 --> 01:12:55.777
Okay. Goodness, Jay.

01:13:06.877 --> 01:13:16.877
Recording. And now I haven't done a summary of this. So.

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:21.127
Cause if we go back to Wednesday.

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:38.177
I'm not sure where this is from.

01:13:39.328 --> 01:13:50.328
Just click on this small button, it will disappear. The transcript. Yes.

01:13:47.078 --> 01:13:54.078
Oh, okay, that's absolutely fine.

01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.978
Yeah, he

01:13:57.577 --> 01:14:05.577
It looks like A this manuscript production was what we were going to do. So that's the best that we can do for.

01:14:02.977 --> 01:14:04.977
Hmm.

01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:17.578
Right, have we got a Thursday recording?

01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:24.827
Hmm. This recording that was converted.

01:14:23.428 --> 01:14:26.428
Yes, what what did we do yesterday?

01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:28.678
Yes, today we did.

01:14:42.428 --> 01:14:48.428
I think yesterday we talked about Ranganison, didn't we?

01:14:50.178 --> 01:14:53.178
Yes, we have open access and open source.

01:14:53.877 --> 01:14:56.877
So if I go back to.

01:14:56.177 --> 01:14:58.177
Open source and open access. Hmm.

01:14:57.228 --> 01:15:08.228
Yes, that's right. And we're gonna the whole thing about Ranganathan and then at the end Yes, and the second one.

01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:01.277
Okay.

01:15:04.027 --> 01:15:07.027
In the 1st session, yes.

01:15:09.428 --> 01:15:16.428
We were all running out of energy was how we, how we create the paper, right? Okay, so that's good.

01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:11.877
We have a GitHub ban.

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.677
And at all about the beta ban also.

01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:22.477
Absolutely.

01:15:37.027 --> 01:15:42.027
So now. We'll edit.

01:15:47.578 --> 01:15:49.578
Salescheck.

01:15:52.878 --> 01:16:01.878
Yes, these are these. So those are well done. So I'm going to put.

01:16:03.577 --> 01:16:05.577
That's in our.

01:16:28.377 --> 01:16:31.377
And what do we have in session 2 and

01:16:33.077 --> 01:16:36.077
Oh, we create our obstacle, yes.

01:17:04.927 --> 01:17:07.927
Right, and now today

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:16.930
We'll put this one in. So.

01:18:49.027 --> 01:19:03.027
That's today, 14. We will go back here. And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to Paste this in today.

01:19:02.627 --> 01:19:16.627
And then say, goodbye. Now it's possible. I might want some help over no weekend, Friday and Saturday. I'm not planning it.

01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:20.978
I'm trying to do all this myself, but if I hit a real crisis, I might come back to you.

01:19:22.078 --> 01:19:24.078
Does that make sense, everyone?

01:19:23.528 --> 01:19:25.528
Yes.

01:19:24.178 --> 01:19:36.178
Yeah. And similarly on Monday. So, so. You have all been very helpful even if you haven't said a word.

01:19:27.428 --> 01:19:31.428
Yes. Hmm.

01:19:31.528 --> 01:19:42.528
Because I can, I cannot do this alone. Do you know what I mean? I mean, I've gone through this.

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:58.578
And you know, hearing renewed. Keep up the conversation. I can see your face and your interest and you smile.

01:19:45.127 --> 01:19:46.127
Yes, we are.

01:19:52.678 --> 01:19:54.678
Hmm.

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.927
Yeah.

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:05.227
There you go. Right. And so on. That's really valuable.

01:20:01.177 --> 01:20:10.177
Okay.

01:20:02.827 --> 01:20:04.827
Yeah.

01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:22.628
So my plan now is the following. To. Take all those transcripts. And structure them, right?

01:20:20.877 --> 01:20:29.877
I will listen to them. I will find out I will have 2 screens I hope. Where I'm listening to the transcript.

01:20:29.527 --> 01:20:39.527
And I will click on it when it comes to the right place and I will put in, the structuring so that we know where it is.

01:20:39.477 --> 01:20:50.477
So that is then a structured recording. Using marked down as a structure and that I think, could be extremely valuable.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:58.378
And then I will try and write the overall, top level, word document that we will send to.

01:20:58.227 --> 01:21:07.227
Whatever. Now we've got to do some diagrams.

01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:17.644
I would like you all actually to sync, start thinking now and perhaps to spend the rest of today if there is any rest of today.

01:21:18.777 --> 01:21:34.777
There isn't much. On what diagrams actually go into this. My brain isn't up to doing it today, so I will probably start looking at that tomorrow.

01:21:33.677 --> 01:21:35.677
Okay.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:44.127
There you go. So, Before we finish any final comments.

01:21:47.578 --> 01:22:06.578
Yeah, for the diagram we can, Think about the process, the, the tools are working or the whole, like, we are using the PDF and then converting into in the, the whole process of the working of the report climate report.

01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:02.128
Absolutely, so

01:22:02.927 --> 01:22:12.927
Yes. Yes, and I will, we will make them schematic diagrams.

01:22:12.479 --> 01:22:14.479
Hmm.

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:16.627
And if they're schematic, they can be done in,

01:22:15.727 --> 01:22:23.727
Graph fish. Yep. Right. So that will be useful.

01:22:19.177 --> 01:22:26.177
Yes Hmm. Okay. Awesome.

01:22:20.128 --> 01:22:33.128
I may be that I draw them out and. Photograph them and Stick them in and then we're doing them in.

01:22:33.528 --> 01:22:44.528
Because it's the model of the story the whole thing is there maybe we can also do the one on the semantic publishing and open access.

01:22:33.827 --> 01:22:35.827
I think that would be valuable.

01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:41.127
Yes.

01:22:45.977 --> 01:22:54.977
D. Okay. Hmm. Okay.

01:22:47.678 --> 01:22:52.678
Indeed. Indeed, absolutely.

01:22:52.377 --> 01:23:04.377
Right. The main thing is to get the top level Word document in and then we can continue working on this and we will make a big point of that in the final document.

01:22:58.877 --> 01:23:06.877
Okay.

01:23:08.277 --> 01:23:10.277
Yes, yes.

01:23:08.978 --> 01:23:26.978
Right. Wave to everybody. I think I will put the transcripts. I think I'll put the transcripts, up onto the, a semantic climate.

01:23:26.178 --> 01:23:36.178
Repository because I think they're more useful than and I will probably give them formal numbers so that we can arrange them.

01:23:37.428 --> 01:23:39.428
Makes sense to everybody.

01:23:41.778 --> 01:23:47.778
Okay, so we now go through the close down ritual, which is.

01:23:41.977 --> 01:23:43.977
Okay.

01:23:47.477 --> 01:23:54.477
Okay. Safe transfer.

01:23:49.077 --> 01:23:59.077
We start. Yes, If I can find out where it is.

01:24:00.227 --> 01:24:10.227
Click on the Zoom Meeting and this you the full new transcript option on the caption button. It will appear.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:17.978
It will appear, okay. That's not what we want.

01:24:12.727 --> 01:24:14.727
Yes.

01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:31.177
You are correct. Captions Beautiful transcript. Save transcript, right.

01:24:30.977 --> 01:24:32.977
Yeah.

01:24:32.727 --> 01:24:37.727
Transcript site and we're going to save the recording.

01:24:38.378 --> 01:24:40.378
Stop the recording.

01:24:39.677 --> 01:24:49.677
Stop that we're going to stop the recording. Also on Zoom.

01:24:51.977 --> 01:24:54.977
Okay.

01:24:53.227 --> 01:25:01.227
Trouble is it puts up Windows in different places on my machine. And I

01:25:05.327 --> 01:25:09.327
Confuses me. Yes, here.
