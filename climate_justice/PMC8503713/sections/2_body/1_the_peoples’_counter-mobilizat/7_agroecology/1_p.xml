For example, Iles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>) proposes, agroecology tends to be delegitimized by actor networks whose theories of change stymie such transitions. He asserts:<disp-quote><p id="Par26">Strong beliefs among scientist, industry, and government elites in the power of science and technology to overcome climate constraints are leading to agroecology being ignored (Iles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>: 5).</p></disp-quote>
Iles also explains that some of the implications of neoliberal agriculture policies for agroecology include: &#8216;Weak farmer resources for adopting agroecological practices; demoralized and eroding rural communities; investment in export support instead of environmental support&#8217; (Iles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>: 5). In turn, summarizing work by Mier y Ter&#225;n Gim&#233;nez Cacho and colleagues, Iles describes enabling dynamics for an agroecological transition, including &#8216;crises, coalescing social organization, effective agroecological practices, external allies, and favorable policies.&#8217; (Iles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>: 7). All of these dynamics are currently coalescing with a global pandemic, a strengthening and increasingly mobilized global food sovereignty movement, and the emergence of more agroecology schools following a pedagogy of horizontal knowledge exchanges.</p>
