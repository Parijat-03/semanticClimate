ES have become a useful concept to describe the bene&#64257;ts that humans obtain from ecosystems and have strong relevance to sustainable land management (SLM) decisions and their outcomes, while NCP is a new approach championed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (explained below). It is timely that this SRCCL report includes attention to ES/NCP, as the previous Special Report on land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) did not make use of these concepts and focused mostly on carbon &#64258;uxes in land&#8211;climate interactions (IPCC 2000). The broader mandate of SRCCL is to address climate, but also land degradation, deserti&#64257;cation and food security issues, all of which are closely linked to the provisioning of various ES/NCP, and the decision and outline for SRCCL explicitly request an examination of how deserti&#64257;cation and degradation &#8216;impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., water, soil and soil carbon and biodiversity that underpins them)&#8217;. Attention to ES/NCP is particularly important in discussing co-bene&#64257;ts, trade-offs and adverse side effects of potential climate change mitigation, land management, or food security response options, as many actions may have positive impacts on climate mitigation or food production, but may also come with a decline in ES provisioning, or adversely impact on biodiversity (Section 6.4.3). This box considers the importance of the ES/NCP concepts, how de&#64257;nitions have changed over time, continuing debates over operationalisation and use of these ideas. It concludes by looking at how ES/NCP are treated in various chapters in this report. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.63" top="483.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.93; y0: 483.55; y1: 493.05; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="483.55" x1="557.63">While the &#64257;rst uses of the term &#8216;ecosystem services&#8217; appeared in the 1980s (Lele et&#160;al. 2013; Mooney and Ehrlich 1997), the roots&#160;of interest in ES extend back to the late 1960s and the extinction crisis, with concern that species decline might cause loss of&#160;valuable bene&#64257;ts to humankind (King 1966; Helliwell 1969; Westman 1977). While concern over extinction was explicitly linked to&#160;biodiversity loss, later ideas beyond biodiversity have animated interest in ES, including the multi-functional nature of ecosystems. A seminal paper by Costanza et&#160;al. (1997) attempted to put an economic value on the stocks of global ES and natural capital on which humanity relied. Attention to ES expanded rapidly after the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005), and the linkages between ES and economic valuation of these functions were addressed by the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study (TEEB 2009). The ES approach has increasingly been used in global and national environmental assessments, including the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (Watson et&#160;al. 2011), and recent and ongoing regional and global assessments organised by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (D&#237;az et&#160;al. 2015). IPBES has recently completed an assessment on land degradation and restoration that addresses a range of ES issues of relevance to the SRCCL report&#160;(IPBES 2018). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="481.1" top="339.56"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 339.56; y1: 349.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="339.56" x1="481.1">The MA de&#64257;ned ES as &#8216;the bene&#64257;ts that ecosystems provide to people,&#8217; and identi&#64257;ed four broad groupings of ES: </span><span style="x0: 481.19; x1: 485.76; y0: 339.56; y1: 349.06; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="481.19" y0="339.56" x1="557.64">provisioning services </span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 82.88; y0: 327.57; y1: 337.07; width: 3.52; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="327.57" x1="193.48">such as food, water, or timber; </span><span style="x0: 193.69; x1: 196.5; y0: 327.57; y1: 337.07; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="193.69" y0="327.57" x1="265.06">regulating services </span><span style="x0: 265.27; x1: 268.08; y0: 327.57; y1: 337.07; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="265.27" y0="327.57" x1="528.04">that have impacts on climate, diseases or water quality, among others; </span><span style="x0: 528.21; x1: 531.91; y0: 327.57; y1: 337.07; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="528.21" y0="327.57" x1="557.59">cultural services </span><span style="x0: 110.47; x1: 113.28; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="110.47" y0="315.57" x1="340.57">that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual bene&#64257;ts; and </span><span style="x0: 340.9; x1: 344.42; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="340.9" y0="315.57" x1="413.5">supporting services </span><span style="x0: 413.86; x1: 417.37; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="413.86" y0="315.57" x1="557.6">such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling (MA 2005). The MA emphasised that people are components of ecosystems engaged in dynamic interactions, and particularly assessed how changes in ES might impact human well-being, such as access to basic materials for living (shelter, clothing, energy); health (clean air and water); social relations (including community cohesion); security (freedom from natural disasters); and freedom of choice (the opportunity to achieve) (MA 2005). Upon publication of the MA, incorporation of ES into land-use change assessments increased dramatically, including studies on how to maximise provisioning of ES alongside human well-being (Carpenter et&#160;al. 2009); how intensive food production to feed growing populations required trading off a number of important ES (Foley et&#160;al. 2005); and how including ES in general circulation models indicated increasing vulnerability to ES change or loss in future climate scenarios (Schr&#246;ter et&#160;al. 2005).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="328.89" top="195.58"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 195.58; y1: 205.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="195.58" x1="328.89">Starting in 2015, IPBES introduced a new related concept to ES, that of </span><span style="x0: 328.58; x1: 334.39; y0: 195.58; y1: 205.08; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="328.58" y0="195.58" x1="445.36">Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People </span><span style="x0: 445.05; x1: 447.69; y0: 195.58; y1: 205.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="445.05" y0="195.58" x1="557.55">(NCP), which are de&#64257;ned as &#8216;all the contributions, both positive and negative, of living nature (i.e., diversity of organisms, ecosystems and their associated ecological and evolutionary processes) to the quality of life of people&#8217; (D&#237;az et&#160;al. 2018).
