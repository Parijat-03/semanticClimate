Adelle et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>) note that the EU was able to promote climate change in its political narrative as a strategic vector for growth and an integrating criterium within the bloc. Hence, the European climate policy obeys the logic (and distortions) of economic, commercial and cooperation relations between the EU&#8217;s own internal agendas and the external market, including building bridges for strategic partnerships under the environmental key.</p>
