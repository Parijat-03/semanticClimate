<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Yet, despite the increased evidence of the health consequences of climate change, as well as the threats to human rights, current adaptation and mitigation measures rarely safeguard communities and promote social justice-oriented solutions that alleviate existing inequities faced by climate-vulnerable populations [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The failure of Global North countries to fulfill their duty of compensating vulnerable countries suffering loss and damage for their disproportionate emissions continues to show the reluctance of some governments to adopt a HRBA [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. During the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) negotiations, many activists have called out countries wanting to erase explicit references to climate-induced health and human rights violations [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We join activists claiming that global leaders seem to have forgotten the world&#8217;s most affected communities, especially young people&#8217;s needs and future generations&#8217; priorities [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Children are systematically overlooked in climate policies, with only 42% of NDCs having reference to children or youth [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, according to UNICEF, only three countries refer specifically to children&#8217;s rights and only five have specific reference to human rights with regards to future generations and intergenerational equity [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nearly 23% do not mention children or youth, nor their well-being, such as education [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. UNICEF also registers a lack of disaster risk-reduction strategies specifically targeted at children [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While literature has attributed disproportionate impacts of climate change to women, gender-responsive measures, including reference to aspects of sexual and reproductive health and rights, and its intersection with human rights are not extensively reflected in countries&#8217; NDCs [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, in NDCs commitments, there is a lack of explicit reference to health co-benefits, and the health impacts of climate change are rarely linked to quantified evidence and policies [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For example, climate laws and adaptation plans in Brazil and Colombia lack explicit reference to a HRBA and weakly integrate the right to health, failing to ensure that public healthcare systems are prepared to respond to the health needs of the most affected communities [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
