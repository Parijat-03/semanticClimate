<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par36">The Shire River is the only outlet from Lake Malawi at Mangochi, with a mean daily discharge of 473.0 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> between 1957 and 2001. The daily discharge had a statistically significant positive trend the period from 1957 to 2001, whereas those for monthly and annual timescales were not significant at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05 level. However, it should be noted that the Shire River outflow was not considered as a covariate in this study, as the river is regulated with barrage operation rules about 72 km downstream from the lake for purposes of lake level stabilization (Shela <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2000</xref>).</p>
