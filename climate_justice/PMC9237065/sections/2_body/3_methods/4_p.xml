One such reference point is the set of&#160;emission reduction targets suggested in the 2018 EU Effort Sharing Regulation (meant to reflect path dependency), the other is a country's upper bound of equity-compatible emissions (the maximum that still could be considered equitable under at least one combination of interpretations across the three dimensions). It should be noted that a common feature for all interpretations is a zero-restriction. A zero-condition is imposed, wherein a country is prohibited from having a positive change in emissions compared to 2005. If the result of a raw interpretation is a positive change, the relevant country is allotted no reduction compared to 2005, and the additional positive allowance initially allocated to it is distributed to all other countries on an equal-per-capita basis. Similarly, we assume that net-negative emissions in 2030 are infeasible, and as such set the maximum required reduction to be 100% of 2005 emissions.</p>
