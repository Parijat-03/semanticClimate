While this is surprising in that the original study showed that young adults had higher levels of climate anxiety than middle or older adults, it is likely that the current sample of undergraduate and graduate students reflected generally high-functioning individuals. Thus, an understanding of the severity of climate change does not necessarily impair functioning. At the same time, the majority of our sample reported having some experience with symptoms of climate change anxiety (i.e., reporting experiencing some symptoms at least &#8220;rarely&#8221;), suggesting the widespread impact of CCA.</p>
