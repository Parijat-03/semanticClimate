The two may even apply simultaneously, as well as in the presence of other non-market regulations such as technology standards or subsidies. The market ethics literature (see above) usually discusses only emission trading schemes as MBMs. A carbon tax can be considered more correctly as a financial mechanism which does not create a market, even though it does influence the market as a Pigouvian tax. Both can at least be considered as methods of carbon pricing (Skovgaard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2019</xref>). Given that all the literature in the maritime transport sector considers both as MBMs, both will be discussed in this paper.</p>
