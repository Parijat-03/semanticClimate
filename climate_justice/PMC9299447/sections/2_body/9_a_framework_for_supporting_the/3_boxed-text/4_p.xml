<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When we learn about climate change in school, we are taught about what we can do at an individual level. This is disheartening because it teaches us that it is our responsibility to resolve climate change, putting more on our shoulders. We also know this is not enough and it will not fix things. Schools do not teach us about different forms of climate action, such as collective action. The way climate change is taught also creates a hierarchy of action. The individual focus means that if young people do not want to commit themselves to all these actions, they do not want to be involved in climate activism. However, we also learn about climate change in activism spaces and on social media. These spaces put the focus and responsibility on governments and people in power. This creates solidarity and community, and we learn that there are many different paths to act on climate change, such as legal routes, protests and lobbying.</p>
