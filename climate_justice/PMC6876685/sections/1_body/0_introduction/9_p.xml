<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Taken together, these prior studies suggest that the problem facing science educators is not merely whether or not students accept that climate change is happening, but also whether students have clear and accurate understandings of why climate change is happening, and&#8212;crucially&#8212;whether students leave their courses confident that their understandings can be put to productive use in some way. Putting it differently: Are our classrooms preparing students only for a &#8220;readerly&#8221; climate literacy, where they take in information about climate, without corresponding attention to more participatory &#8220;writerly&#8221; forms of climate literacy, where they feel prepared to take action in response to what they have learned? If students come to our courses already accepting climate change is occurring, are we merely &#8220;preaching to the choir,&#8221; so to speak, when we have the opportunity to support students in composing new verses?</p>
