The workshop began with a brief welcome and a review of the day's agenda. We then showed an interactive PowerPoint presentation (<xref rid="s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A</xref>) featuring an overview of community organizing as a leadership practice and used the example of the 1955&#8211;1956 Montgomery bus boycott to demonstrate the importance of community organizing. This was followed by a second interactive PowerPoint presentation (<xref rid="s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix B</xref>) on public narrative, which described why learning to tell a shared story is important. This presentation included two video examples, (1) a story of self, delivered by Predrag Stojicic (<xref rid="s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix C</xref>), and (2) a full public narrative, delivered by James Croft (<xref rid="s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix D</xref>, Suggested Resources), to demonstrate the components of a well-executed public narrative. After each example, the facilitators led a group debrief. We included speaking notes for the presentations in the respective PowerPoints (<xref rid="s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendices A</xref> and <xref rid="s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>) and instructions on how to integrate these presentations into the full module in the facilitator manual (<xref rid="s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix D</xref>).</p>
