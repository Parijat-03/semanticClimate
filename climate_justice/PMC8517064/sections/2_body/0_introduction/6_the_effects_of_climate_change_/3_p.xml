The incidence of extreme climate related disasters (e.g. flood, drought, extreme temperatures, storms) has increased significantly over the period 1990 to 2016 and accounts for more than 80% of all internationally reported disasters (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>). The same analysis indicates that 36% of the countries that experienced increases in the level of undernourishment since 2005 have also experienced extreme drought. In 2017, the average prevalence of undernourishment in countries with high exposure to climate risks was 3.2 percent higher than that of countries with low or no risk, and 351 million more people undernourished in the high exposure countries (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Increased exposure to more frequent and multiple types of climate extremes in low and middle-income countries<bold>.</bold>
