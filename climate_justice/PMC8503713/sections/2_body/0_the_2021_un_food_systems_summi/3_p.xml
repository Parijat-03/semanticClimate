Failing to take action against their own excesses in spite of decades of warning, the multi-stakeholder dialogues hosted by the powerful elite have brought us five &#8216;action areas&#8217;. Instead of food sovereignty, they would sell us food security. Their inability to co-opt the science, practices, and social movement inherent in agroecology leads them to &#8216;boost nature-based solutions&#8217;, ensuring a boost in profits for multinationals instead of a commitment to ending the degrading practices of industrial agriculture. Nature-based solutions include carbon credits for offsets&#8212;essentially a free pass for the most polluting industries to buy their way to &#8216;net zero&#8217;. The action areas promote &#8216;equitable livelihoods&#8217;, which we take to mean they want to employ us in their fields and factories rather than assure us our right livelihoods with secure tenure. Next, they propose to teach <italic>us&#8212;</italic>some of the world&#8217;s most enduring, resourceful, and sustainable custodians of land, rivers, and sea&#8212;resilience. And finally, the multinationals are here to attract investment in their false solutions, selling off more land and resources, while guaranteeing their influence over the structures that govern them.</p>
