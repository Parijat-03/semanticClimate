Since both heat and greenspace were measured for May and September, this provided four dependent variables. Physical data relating to land surface temperature, surface imperviousness, and vegetation abundance were gathered from LANDSAT 5 satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed imagery taken 8 May and 29 September 2011. These data values have seven bands, with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the visible and short-wave infrared and near infrared bands, and 120 m in the thermal band. Clear sky imagery from these dates were selected for a pre-monsoon and late-monsoon seasonal contrast of the hottest month of May (high urban heat, low vegetation) with the cooler month of September (low urban heat, high vegetation), respectively. Due to heterogeneous land uses within a city as large as Delhi, the distribution of heat and vegetation may vary in different seasons. Evaluating changes of the physical data within the study area allows for a sensitivity analysis of the relationship between heat exposure, vegetation proximity, and social indicators. All values for urban heat and greenspace were calculated at the pixel level. The mean values from all pixels located within each ward boundary in the NCT of Delhi were utilized for our study.</p>
