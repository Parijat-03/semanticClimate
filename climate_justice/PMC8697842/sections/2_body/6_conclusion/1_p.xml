To achieve this goal, the study has been prepared in three layers. Initially, the per capita ecological balance of the country was evaluated. In the second step, the decoupling factor analysis for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was performed, not only to investigate their possible decoupling from real income, but also their decoupling from population. The decoupling factor analysis for ecological footprint was also conducted to examine its possible decoupling from real income and population. Then, the decoupling results of ecological footprint were compared with the results of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The decoupling factor analysis results revealed that population and real income were more dominant factors in changes of ecological footprint as compared to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the third and last step, by using the LMDI approach, a decomposition analysis was performed to identify the determinants that change the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Australia. The well-known Kaya equation was expanded by including one additional factor, namely, the energy structure. A brief summary of the decomposition analysis results for Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table.5</label><caption><p>Brief summary of the LMDI decomposition analysis results</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Impact of the factor on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (ktons)</th><th align="left">Impact of the factor on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Per capita income</td><td align="left">158,851.4</td><td align="left">114.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Population</td><td align="left">134,301.1</td><td align="left">96.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Energy intensity</td><td align="left">&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;165,163</td><td align="left">&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;119.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Carbon intensity</td><td align="left">16,295.9</td><td align="left">11.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Energy structure</td><td align="left">&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;5668.1</td><td align="left">&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;4.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total</td><td align="left">138,616.9</td><td align="left">100</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
