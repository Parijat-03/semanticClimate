</sup> Most postlicensure health professionals learn optimally and develop
self-efficacy from iterative presentations of content and case-based learning.<sup>

</sup> The course participants in the CCHH ECHO benefitted from both
didactics and cases, with ample time to ask questions. Cases were also
developed to illustrate the diversity (people experiencing homelessness,
rural and urban, range of ethnicities, gender and ages, etc) of patients
seeking care for various climate related illnesses, and to model
communication strategies that health professionals might consider when
approaching a patient suffering from an illness provoked or worsened by the
climate. Because the hallmark of the ECHO model is clinician to clinician
telementoring with case-consultation, and patients are not part of the
network, medical simulation with standardized patients comes very close to
teaching best practices communication strategies with the Project ECHO
platform.</p>
