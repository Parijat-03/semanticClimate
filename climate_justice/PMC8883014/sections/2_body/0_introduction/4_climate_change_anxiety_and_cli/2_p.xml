Another qualitative study examining coping strategies among youth worried about climate change indicated that problem-focused coping strategies, including engaging in individual and collective action, were used by some youth to regulate climate change-related worries (Ojala, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). Finally, research has demonstrated associations between engaging in individual climate action, namely sustainable behavior, and happiness (Corral-Verdugo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>). Taken together, these studies point to the potential&#160;of climate&#160;action to reduce distress associated with the threat of climate change.</p>
