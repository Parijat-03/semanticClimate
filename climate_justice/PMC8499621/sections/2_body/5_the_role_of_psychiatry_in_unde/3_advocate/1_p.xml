As advocates for patients&#8217; and communities&#8217; mental health and well-being, psychiatrists can help to drive these objectives forwards. There is already strong evidence that the psychiatric community can use in advocating for policies and interventions which can build local community resilience and tackle global injustice. These could include but are not limited to urban planning and regeneration; increased green space; cleaner air; community food growing; liveable streets; and high-quality, low-carbon housing. Importantly, they should also include national and international policies for urgent action on climate change and protection for those harmed or displaced by it, which may further exacerbate pre-existing mental health inequalities. With an already increasing frequency of adverse weather events, there is also an important role for the psychiatric community in advocating for policies and funding support for appropriate mental health interventions in the wake of climate-driven events such as floods, major storms and wildfires, and to strengthen resilience to them.</p>
