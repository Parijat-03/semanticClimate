<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There is much to be done to orient the education and training of the health workforce to ensure that health services are more comprehensive, responsive, integrated and accessible and coordinated to address the diverse range of health threats facing humanity (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2015</xref>). Biomedical models form the basis of this training, which focuses largely on diseases and their cure for individuals, to the exclusion of the socio-political context within which they arise. Training can be made more effective through recognizing the impact of social inequities on the patterning of disease and health promotion. (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Fennig and Denov, 2019</xref>). The grand challenge is: first, for faculty and students to gain a deep understanding of the need to balance the current focus on individual minds and bodies, with the social, economic and physical environments in which people live, and in which health and equity can be achieved. This may require curricula adaptation. Second, for them to proceed to jobs and careers within the health and other sectors that enable them to respond to the social determinants of health to advance health equity and environmental sustainability and climate justice.</p>
