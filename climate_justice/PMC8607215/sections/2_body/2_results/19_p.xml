In its entirety, the fine could be argued as inefficient towards a radical shift to renewables or fewer emissions. Perhaps, insertion of a tax-free benchmark could have encouraged one not to exceed such a standard instead of incurring fines; (ii) failure to set out clear guidelines on how to use the proceeds. As it stands now, there is a lack of clarity on how proceeds will be dispensed. This obscurity is more glaring as the Act takes a step back from ring-fencing the revenues for exact climate-related intervention. This contention has the potential of opening a flood gate for critics to assert that perhaps the mechanism is the latest government money-spinning machinery to recoup revenue for its depleted coffers. It might be useful to perhaps insert a provision in the Act indicating that the proceeds will be recycled into (re)afforestation, renewables for poor communities, and social infrastructures to moderate the negative effect of GHGs on youth. (iii) The third layer is the exemption of the energy sector from similar fines. The energy sector contributes 84% of the approximate 464 million metric tons (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e) GHGs emitted by the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of this figure, two state-owned entities (SoEs), Eskom and Sasol account for 42% and 11%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Sasol depends on fossil fuels such as coal for the production of steam, electricity as well as gasification feedstock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Eskom, on the other hand, relies on three coal-fired power plants in Medupi, Kusile, and Kendal to generate approximately 90% of the country&#8217;s electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This consumption results in the use of more than 90 million tons of coal per annum, thus reversing attempts towards GHGs mitigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
