Because coastal wetlands (marshes, mangroves and saw grass meadows) store a quarter of the carbon found in the earth&#8217;s soil while only comprising about five-percent of the land mass, destruction of these areas due to rising seas releases disproportionate amounts of sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere. In one section, Rush describes how humans have tried to alter these marshes through various engineering measures, and in doing so changed the complex ecosystems that made the marsh thrive.</p>
