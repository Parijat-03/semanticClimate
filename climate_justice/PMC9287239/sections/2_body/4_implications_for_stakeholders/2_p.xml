First, voluntary SBTs cannot substitute for the policies needed to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently to meet the Paris temperature goal. The uptake across regions and sectors is too uneven and it is unlikely that initial target progress will continue in the absence of new policy. Moreover, the potentials for creative emission accounting and incomplete emission disclosure make it difficult to even assess target progress and the effect on global emissions. Second, if policymakers aim to co-regulate SBTs with the SBTi (as proposed by Lister [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]), work is needed to increase the transparency of target-setting methods and approved targets and ensure rigorous emission accounting (see above), provide regulatory backing to monitor compliance, and ensure enforcement and to consider (mis)alignments with national determined contributions (NDCs) and national net-zero targets. Third, given that most companies likely rely on new policies to meet their SBTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], policymakers could engage with companies and other relevant stakeholders about the design of such policies. This could further motivate uptake of SBTs and increase the likelihood of governments setting more ambitious national climate targets.</p>
