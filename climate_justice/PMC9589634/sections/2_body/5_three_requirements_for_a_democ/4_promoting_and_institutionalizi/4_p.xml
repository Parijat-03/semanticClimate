This is what happened in the case of the French convention (Landemore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, pp. 118&#8211;120). As Lafont has convincingly argued, the &#8216;lottocratic&#8217; idea of empowering mini-publics to take decisions constitutes just another variant of the expertocratic shortcut (Lafont <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). If we assume that it is possible for a descriptively representative sample of the population to be comprehensively informed, to deliberate and decide on a matter, the mini-publics&#8217; participants will no longer be representative after deliberation. Instead, they will have become experts to whose decisions the non-participating majority is asked to blindly defer to, thus violating conditions for democratic self-government. Lafont argues that such an approach inadmissibly reduces the epistemic function of deliberation as a mode of political communication to the tracking of truth. This is highly problematic because &#8216;another epistemic function of deliberation is disregarded, namely tracking the justifiability of the policies in question to those who must comply with them&#8217; (ibid.: 98). If democracy is to be understood as self-government of the citizens, this justification must take place vis-&#224;-vis all those who are subject to decisions. Otherwise, not only democratic legitimacy, but also compliance will be undermined (ibid.).</p>
