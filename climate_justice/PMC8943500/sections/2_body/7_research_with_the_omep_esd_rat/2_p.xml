They investigated whether the ERS-SDEC was relevant for assessing education for sustainability and what the indicators encountered in kindergartens. The authors discuss the low scores in the teacher&#8217;s ratings as partly a result linked to the strictness of the first edition of the rating scale (ERS-SDEC) and report support for a continued use of the second edition of the scale (OMEP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>).</p>
