The latest plausible date for attributing such liability seems to be 1995, the date of publication of the second assessment report of the IPCC, identifying a discernible human influence on the climate beyond&#160;the findings of the first report of 1990, it&#8217;s likely consequences, and, by doing so, suggesting that measures are required to hinder &#8216;dangerous climate change&#8217;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. One could cite other dates for good reasons, e.g. the 1992 ratification of the UNFCCC at the Earth Summit or the late 1980s establishment of the IPCC, which we assess in more detail in the Conclusions section and in the Supplementary Information, section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>. By moving the year of accounting back to 1995 the actual emissions caused since then are attributed to the emitting countries. As interpretations to address historical considerations can take different forms, we utilize two approaches, indicated as <italic>R1-hist-emi</italic> and <italic>R5-cumulative-emi/cap</italic>, with their distinctions discussed in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and the methodology section.</p>
