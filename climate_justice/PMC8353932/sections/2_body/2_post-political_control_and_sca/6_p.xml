According to Mullainathan and Shafir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>), scarcity of any kind&#8212;be it a shortage of cash or a tight deadline&#8212;captures our attention and creates a <italic>feeling</italic> of scarcity. This scarcity mindset, they argue, changes how we think: it affects what we see, how we weigh our choices and even how we behave. Scarcity effectively changes how we interpret the world.</p>
