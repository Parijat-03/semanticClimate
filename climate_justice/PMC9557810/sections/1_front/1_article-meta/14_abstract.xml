agents of change for a socially just habitat? The paper explores this question
through the experiences of eight grassroots schools of popular urbanism working
under the umbrella of the Habitat International Coalition (HIC) in Latin
America. Building on a process of self-documentation and collective pedagogic
reflection driven by the protagonists of these schools, the analysis explores
the core pedagogic practices identified across the schools to enact popular
urbanism as a collective and intentional praxis: to weave,

that, put in motion, these pedagogic practices transgress the rules and
boundaries of the formal classroom, taking participants to and through other
sites and modes of learning that host significant potential to stimulate
collectivizing and alternative ways of seeking change towards urban
equality.</p></abstract>
