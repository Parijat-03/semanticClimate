      <td>ILK can be deployed in the practice of climate governance, especially at the local level where actions are informed by the principles of\ndecentralisation and autonomy (Chanza and de Wit 2016; Harmsworth and Awatere 2013). International environmental agreements\nare also increasingly including attention to ILK and diverse cultural perspectives, for reasons of social justice and inclusive decision-\nmaking (Brondizio and Tourneau 2016). However, the context-specific, and dynamic nature of ILK and its embeddedness in local\ninstitutions and power relations needs consideration (Naess 2013). It is also important to take a gendered approach so as not to\nfurther marginalise certain knowledge, as men and women hold different knowledge, expertise and transmission patterns (D&#237;az-\nReviriego et al. 2017).</td>
