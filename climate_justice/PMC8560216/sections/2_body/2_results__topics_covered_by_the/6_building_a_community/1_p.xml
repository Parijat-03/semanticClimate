The initial focus of community building has been online. The podcast is on many social media platforms. The intention is that in the next two years there will be possibilities for funding for a virtual conference, which can later be turned into an in-person event. Currently, the BGC podcast does not have sponsors or advertisements. Financial support is needed for operations of the podcast and for creating a hub where environmentalists can connect, collaborate, and create more diverse and supportive movements. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of funding, and also because it is not easy for DQTBIPOC to make it to in-person events, it is possible that the podcast will remain a virtual community in the near future. Future episodes may include panel discussions with multiple guests speaking on an issue from different perspectives.</p>
