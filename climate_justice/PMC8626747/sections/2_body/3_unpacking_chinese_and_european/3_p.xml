There is the issue of socio-environmental and climate impacts mainly caused by the means of production, which are often predatory and at the roots of the primary trade of goods and commodities between Brazil (the exporter) and both China and the EU (the importers). This is particularly true in the case of agribusiness, whose effects in the Amazonia and the Cerrado (the Brazilian savanna) have increased in the last years (Abramovay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Marengo and Souza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>). Also, European and Chinese projects and investments on energy and infrastructure produce relevant negative socioenvironmental effects in the Brazilian territory. In 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement ratification by Brazil, 51% of emissions were caused by deforestation; in January 2020, the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon&#8217;s Deforestation Alert System) detected 188 km<sup>2</sup> of deforestation in the Legal Amazon, an increase of 74% over January 2019, when deforestation covered 108 km<sup>2</sup>. Deforestation remained, in the post-Paris Agreement scenario, an authorized practice in the context of fragile institutional governance and increase of illegal actions, following the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro as the newly elected president of Brazil.</p>
