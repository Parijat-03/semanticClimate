international community were grouped under the <italic toggle="yes">global community</italic>
actor group category. Comments were encouraging global altruism in vaccination
initiatives to increase vaccination rates around the world (e.g. &#8220;. . . The
entire world must help the entire world get vaccinated&#8221;). In addition,
commenters were also concerned about the moral implications pertaining to
vaccine inequity as privileged countries produced and purchased more vaccines
than less privileged countries. One commenter writes in that regard, &#8220;I am
concerned about rich countries buying up vaccines and smaller, less rich
countries trying to compete for those vaccines. Ignoring the moral implications,
this is not be good for our world.&#8221;</p>
