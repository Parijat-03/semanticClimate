The impact of colonialism and capitalism on Indigenous history and culture has been an overarching theme. For example, in the episode with Dr. Mariaelena Huambachano, she talked about how when governments impose processed foods over Indigenous diets, it is often less healthy due to the use of pesticides for mass production. Losing the right to eat, grow, or share food that speaks of your culture and the health of the land is an example of food injustice.</p>
