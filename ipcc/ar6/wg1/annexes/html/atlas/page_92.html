But there are mixed decreases and increases in the western part of the US, and the west coast 6 when the RCMs are driven by MPI-LR and HadGEM2. Both WRF and RegCM4 follow the pattern of the 7 MPI-LR GCM in most of the domain. Large parts of Mexico (Figure Atlas.44:) exhibit decreases when 8 RegCM is driven by all the GCMs and for WRF when driven by MPI-LR. However, there are also 9 simulations (Mearns et al., 2017; Rendfrey et al., 2018) where there are large increases in the west, 10 particularly in those RCMs driven by CanESM2.  These analyses demonstrate that spanning the range of 11 available climate sensitivities in the CMIP5 group is critical for producing a representative range of 12 dynamically downscaled projections.  13 14 15 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 583.01; y1: 593.99; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="583.01" x1="215.86">[START Figure Atlas.44: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="583.01" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.14; y0: 583.01; y1: 593.99; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">16 17 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 558.92; y1: 568.94; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="558.92" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.44: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="558.92" x1="531.32" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 134.3; y0: 558.92; y1: 568.94; width: 6.68; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Changes in the annual mean surface air temperature (top) and precipitation (bottom) by three GCMs </span><span x0="27.66" y0="558.71" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 558.71; y1: 569.69; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="547.4" x1="528.79" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 130.96; y0: 547.4; y1: 557.42; width: 3.34; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(GFDL ESM2M, MPI ESM-LR, HadGEM2-ES) and two RCMs (WRF and RegCM4) nested in the </span><span x0="27.66" y0="547.19" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 547.19; y1: 558.17; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">19 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="535.94" x1="161.81" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 134.85; y0: 535.94; y1: 545.96; width: 7.23; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">GCMs.  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="535.73" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 535.73; y1: 546.71; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">20 21 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 510.53; y1: 521.51; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="510.53" x1="202.43">[END Figure Atlas.44: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="510.53" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 510.53; y1: 521.51; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">22 23 24 Prein et al. (2019) investigated two sets of RCMs regarding weather types and found that under future 25 conditions the NA-CORDEX simulations showed substantial changes in certain weather types, e.g., related 26 to increased monsoonal flow frequency and drying of the northern Great Plains in summer.  27 28 In addition to NA-CORDEX, other researchers (Wang and Kotamarthi, 2015; Ashfaq et al., 2016) have 29 produced higher-resolution simulations over large parts of North America. Wang and Kotamarthi (2015) 30 used the WRF RCM at 12 km resolution nested in the CCSM4 over a domain covering much of North 31 America for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for mid and late 21st century in addition to a current period. Annual 32 changes in precipitation include decreasing intensity over the southwest, increasing intensity over the eastern 33 US and much of Canada and an increase in days with heavy precipitation in most areas. This pattern is 34 similar to the changes seen in CCSM4 (their Figure 9), as well as the changes seen in the NA-CORDEX 35 model simulations, which are driven by different GCMs. Ashfaq et al. (2016) analysed results of RegCM4 at 36 18 km nested in 11 different global models for current and a near-term future period (2010&#8211;2050). Both 37 winter (snow) and summer (liquid) extremes are projected to increase across the US. The ensemble mean 38 pattern of precipitation change resembles what is found in NA-CORDEX and the Wang and Kotamarthi 39 simulations, but the changes are less intense at least partially because of the earlier time period examined. 40 They also note, however, that many areas show decreases or increases depending on the driving GCM.  41 42 A collection of research articles has considered changes in precipitation extremes in NA-CORDEX, 43 particularly through analysis of changes in Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, calculations 44 frequently used in hydrologic engineering. Higher-resolution modelling is used to analyse changes in IDFs 45 since better reproduction of extremes tends to occur at higher spatial resolutions. DeGaetano and Castellano 46 (2017) used a small set of NA-CORDEX simulations to determine future changes in extreme precipitation in 47 New York State, along with several other downscaling techniques. The dynamically downscaled simulations 48 yielded much larger changes (35%) in 100-year extremes compared to those calculated through an analogue 49 statistical approach (15%). These results have important implications for choice of downscaling method 50 when extreme precipitation is an important consideration (see Chapter 10). Cook et al. (submitted) 51 investigated in 34 cities how choice of spatial resolution of the RCM ensemble affects future IDF curves. 52 The resolution effect was complex in that it depended partially on what duration event was considered. The 53 higher-resolution model results produced larger changes for the 24-hour duration event, but not necessarily 54 for the 1-hour duration event. This indicates greater complexity in potential changes in IDFs based on the 55 </span></div></body></html>
