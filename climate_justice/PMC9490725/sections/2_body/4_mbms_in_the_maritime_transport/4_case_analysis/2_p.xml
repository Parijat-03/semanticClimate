First, it affects the kind of solutions proposed because they are intended foremost as commercial activities rather than solving the problem (thus overlapping with one of the fairness objections about achieving inferior outcomes discussed above). The proposed solutions (MBMs and efficiency approaches rather than regulations or bans) make little difference to emissions and continue a business-as-usual approach. Second, removing the urgency allows actors at the IMO to delay and postpone, which would be more difficult to justify if the stigma were greater. Once again, it acts as a placeholder, allowing actors to say they are in favour of action but then argue over the form and the price rather than take any action. &#8220;Discourses of climate delay&#8221; (Lamb et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>) are becoming increasingly prominent, as climate denial has been replaced by delay, a key area being this kind of extended debate over technological and market solutions. Climate scientist Alex Steffen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2017</xref>: unpaginated) goes further, defining &#8220;predatory delay&#8221; as &#8220;the blocking or slowing of needed change, in order to make money off unsustainable, unjust systems in the meantime&#8221;.</p>
