We can take a lesson from the experience of Camille Parmesan (as cited in Thomas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>), a professor at Plymouth University and the University of Texas, who thought very seriously about abandoning her research on climate change after becoming &#8220;professionally depressed.&#8221; Whether we are a care receiver or a care provider or even a scientific researcher, &#8220;[G]rowing bodies of research in the relatively new field of psychology of global warming suggest that climate change will take a pretty heavy toll on the human psyche as storms become more destructive and droughts more prolonged&#8221; (Thomas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>).</p>
