<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Carbon intensity of global economy by 2030 under 6 different scenarios.&#160;Historical data on carbon intensity for the time-horizon 2011&#8211;2019 from Our World in Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>). Global emissions data for 2020 and 2021 were sourced from Statistica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021</xref>). Figures applied for economic growth scenarios based on average global growth rate 2010 to 2020 of ~&#8201;2.5% and max global growth rate of ~&#8201;4.5% (in 2010) from World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2021</xref>). Data on global GDP for 2020 and 2021 sourced from the International Monetary Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>). Emissions cuts scenarios of 7.6%&#160;per year to meet the 1.5&#160;&#176;C goal and 2.7%&#160;per year for the 2&#160;&#176;C goal applied in this analysis have been sourced from UNEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">b</xref>). These emissions cuts are reported by UNEP for a 2020&#8211;2030 time-horizon and in&#160;the analysis shown in this figure,&#160;emissions cut figures have been adjusted to account for actual economic and emissions growth in 2020&#8211;2021, with emissions cuts &#8216;missed&#8217; for 2021&#160;then spread across 2022&#8211;2030</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="42398_2022_231_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e721"/></fig></p>
