For example, <em>carbon dioxide</em> and <em>aerosols</em>, by altering internal heating and cooling rates within the <em>atmosphere</em>, can each cause changes to cloud cover and other variables thereby producing an <em>effective radiative forcing</em> even in the absence of any surface warming or cooling. Adjustments are usually rapid in the sense that they begin to occur right away, before <em>climate feedbacks</em> which are driven by global surface warming (although some adjustments may still take significant time to proceed to completion, for example those involving vegetation or <em>ice sheets</em>).</p></dd><div>
