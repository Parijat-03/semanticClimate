<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par27">Both linear and non-linear link functions between the covariates and the location and scale parameters (<italic>&#956;</italic> and <italic>&#963;</italic>) were tested to select the best approach. For the three parameter distributions (GEV and PE3), the shape parameter (<italic>&#958;</italic>) was assumed to be constant due to difficulties in the reliability of its estimates (&#352;raj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2016</xref>, Gillend and Katz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). The best fitting model was evaluated through a multi-criteria approach comprised of goodness of fit (GOFs) measures, namely the Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) which should be a minimum and the deviance information criteria (DIC) (for Bayesian parameter estimation only) which should be a maximum. In addition, likelihood ratios (RL) between the distribution fitting approaches for nested models were assessed at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05 significance level (Coles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>; Madsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Prosdocimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>; Su and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>). In the extreme lake level frequency analyses, the package extRemes (Gilleland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) was applied in R statistical software (R Core Team, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>).</p>
