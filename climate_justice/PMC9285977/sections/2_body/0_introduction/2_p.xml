Actions are needed now,&#8221; stated Katr&#237;n Jakobsd&#243;ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland, in her address at the opening of the Arctic Circle on October 19, 2018. She then proceeded to describe the massive changes taking place in the Arctic&#8212;the summer ice cap could be lost within a generation&#8212;and how they will impact on indigenous peoples, ecosystems and on the region's function as a global thermal regulator. Katr&#237;n Jakobsd&#243;ttir was speaking of the need for hope in the wake of the IPCC Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0160" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A decade ago, as the international climate regime seemed to crumble in Copenhagen, some found hope in the actions in urban areas around the world (Hoffmann, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0152" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, such hope did not always seem to translate into action, as recognized in the report of the Working Group 3 of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="wcc643-blkfxd-0002"><p>Thousands of cities are undertaking climate action plans, but their aggregate impact on urban emissions is uncertain (robust evidence, high agreement) &#8230; there has been little systematic assessment regarding the overall extent to which cities are implementing mitigation policies and emission reduction targets are being achieved, or emissions reduced (Edenhofer et al., <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0121" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, p. 928).</p></disp-quote>
