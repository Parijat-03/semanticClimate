In the past 30 years, its population has more than tripled and vehicle population has increased almost fifteen fold. Delhi has been consecutively ranked among the top states in terms of Monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) over the past few years, which indicates a flourishing state of Delhi&#8217;s commercial sector. Delhi&#8217;s energy consumption growth in all sectors, following changing lifestyle patterns as well as booming economic growth has resulted in a rise in per capita primary energy consumption of Delhiites. In the year 2010, 98.74% of the total households were dependent on Electricity for their lighting needs. Similarly in the same year 85.14% households were using LPG and 1.82% firewood as the primary source of cooking in Delhi.  In economic terms, Delhi seems poised to be the next emerging giant city, in both economic and energetic terms.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.03" top="505.56"><span x0="72.02" y0="505.56" x1="508.03" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 505.56; y1: 517.56; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In this part of the report an assessment of the future energy needs and expected GHG emissions under different scenarios over the period 2010 to 2025 is made for the state of Delhi. End use sector-wise projections are made for Domestic, Transportation, Commercial and Industrial sectors, as these are the major consumers of energy in NCT-Delhi. For each sector, drivers of energy, technology and historical growth are indentified. Accordingly trends are then analyzed and used for projection of future growth.  </span></div><div left="75.14" right="508.14" top="398.38"><span x0="75.14" y0="398.38" x1="508.14" style="x0: 75.14; x1: 79.14; y0: 398.38; y1: 410.38; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the present study we have created three scenarios to characterize what is likely and what is possible. One scenario &#8211; representing a &#8216;Business as usual&#8217; course &#8211; is an estimation of present trends, modified to reflect existing and likely demand of energy in future. The second scenario, termed as &#8216;Low Growth Scenario&#8217;, is reflecting a state of slow economic growth over the next fifteen years and consequent energy demand and GHG emissions under such a scenario. In the third scenario, termed as &#8216;High Growth Scenario&#8217;, we assume a rapidly growing economy under which all the sectors are characterized by high energy demand. Results of this analysis provide valuable inputs to the understanding of realistic energy demand scenarios for NCT-Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="434.95" top="237.31"><span x0="72.02" y0="237.31" x1="434.95" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 237.31; y1: 249.31; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">7.1Macro-Economic Indicators &amp; their Projections for NCT-Delhi </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.4" top="209.71"><span x0="72.02" y0="209.71" x1="508.4" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 209.71; y1: 221.71; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">For Delhi as a whole, the macro-economic indicators are given in Table 27. These projections are based on the various Five-Year Plans of the planning commission and Census of India studies. The data reflects that the percentage of Delhi&#8217;s population would increase by about more than 50% in the year 2025. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.38" top="134.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="134.23" x1="508.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 134.23; y1: 146.23; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi's population in the year 2011 was 16.75 Million (16,753,235); the expectation is that the population of Delhi may range between 27 to 28 million in the year 2025. A sharp increase in population can also be attributed to large number of people migrating to Delhi from other parts of the country in search of better life and employment opportunities.
