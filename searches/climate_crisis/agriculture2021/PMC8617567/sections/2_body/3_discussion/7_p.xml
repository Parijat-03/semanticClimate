<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our study is not without limitations. First, to explicitly understand how wildfires impact human recreation behaviors, it is critical to study the historical wildfire records locally, since people's attitudes to the fires can vary in space and time due to many factors like their experience with wildfires and education levels (Edgeley &amp; Burnett,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Second, the top&#8208;selected model only explained 19% of the variance in the spatiotemporal patterns of the median of minimum dwell time at parks, indicating that there could be some other factors that might impact the time that people spent. Although we considered national and state parks in each county in the analyses, parks with different recreation purposes, facilities, sizes, and features can also determine the group of visitors they attract, the purpose of their visits, and the time they spend in those places (Larson et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Xiao, Lee, &amp; Larson,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Zhai et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, consideration of the detailed park conditions is needed for future studies to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility to parks. Third, this study explored the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility to parks during the pandemic and wildfire season at the monthly scale without the consideration of the intra&#8208;month variations. However, human mobilities, COVID&#8208;19 outbreaks, and wildfire situations can vary in daily or even at a much finer scale. Thus, we may expect different spatiotemporal effects of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and wildfires on human mobility to parks at other scales.</p>
