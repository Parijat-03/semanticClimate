Health professionals also require ongoing continuing education about the emergence of pandemics, the care of patients, and the education of individuals, families, communities, and populations. There are enormous challenges that we face in addressing health of the world's people as natural habitats are destroyed and wildlife encroaches on areas where populations reside. Education is key in addressing the health challenges confronted related to pandemics such as COVID&#8208;19 in our climate&#8208;changing world.</p>
