Here, innovations developed by indigenous people and peasants often offer some of the best tools in today's climate-changed world. Examples are systems of controlled fire interventions, ethics of landscape conservation, and agroecological systems of food production (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010</xref>). Innovative models of multi-use agroecology promoted by transnational movements, such as <italic>La Via Campesina</italic>, point the way forward. Notably, in their engagements with global institutions such as the United Nations and their selective engagements with local and regional markets, <italic>La Via Campesina</italic> addresses many of the gaps in prioritizing the poor in planetary justice in the social green approach. Even though it is not easy to replicate agroecological approaches in industrialized countries, many of the challenges here are rooted in the structure of current regimes&#8212;which can be adjusted&#8212;and not in the feasibility of transitioning to an agroecological regime (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Levidow, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bellon and Ollivier, 2018</xref>).</p>
