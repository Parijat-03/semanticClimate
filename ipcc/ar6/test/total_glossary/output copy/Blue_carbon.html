<p>Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted vegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. These <em>ecosystems</em> have high carbon burial rates on a per unit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments. They provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to ecosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon ecosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the <em>atmosphere</em>. There is current debate regarding the application of the blue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and ecosystems, including the open <em>ocean</em>.</p>
