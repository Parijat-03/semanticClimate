Many countries are likely to face both direct and indirect threats to human and national security, which as a &#8220;threat multiplier&#8221; will snowball and spill over beyond national borders and onto the backyards of industrial countries (CAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>; Bernauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Detraz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>; Banda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>). Oxfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2018</xref>) indicates that people in poorer countries are on average five times more likely than people in rich countries to be displaced by extreme weather events. Where will they move, either internally, pushing others further into poverty, fuelling resource conflicts and political instability? Or, trying to move elsewhere through human traffickers, sometimes dying &#8220;watery deaths&#8221; or from other exposures?</p>
