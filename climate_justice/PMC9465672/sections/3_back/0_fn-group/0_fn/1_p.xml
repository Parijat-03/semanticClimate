When a creek crosses a rice field, farmers may opt either to build a contour dike around it and/or create a dam (where rainwater accumulates) through the construction of a major dike perpendicular to the flow of the creek &#8220;to close the river&#8221; (<italic>fitcha rio</italic> in Creole).</p>
