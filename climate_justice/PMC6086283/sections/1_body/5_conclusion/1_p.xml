<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par46">Socio-political norms are an essential part of current sustainability discourses, both in the form of ethical norms and in the form of techno-scientific norms. Therefore, analysis of the normative structure and dynamics of the three documents&#8217; can help the sustainability community understand how these texts portray and frame the future of sustainability. By modeling normativity in the sustainability discourse, this article will hopefully help better understand how, if actually used to inform policy decisions and practices, the three texts will end up impacting future directions of sustainable development.</p>
