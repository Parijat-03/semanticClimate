The pilot study is based on a two-arm, cluster-controlled design assessing the feasibility of the PCS evaluation design in five schools with seven classes receiving the PCS (henceforth intervention classes) and five classes serving as waitlist controls that received the PCS three weeks later (henceforth control classes; <xref rid="ijerph-19-08039-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
