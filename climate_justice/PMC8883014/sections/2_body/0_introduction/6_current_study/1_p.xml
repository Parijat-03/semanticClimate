Our primary aims were: 1) to examine associations between CCA and clinical measures of distress including GAD and MDD symptoms; 2) to investigate individual and collective climate action as potential moderators of associations between CCA and symptoms of GAD and MDD and 3) to explore the subjective, individualized experiences and behaviors of participants experiencing distress related to CCA. Aims 1 and 2 were investigated quantitatively, while Aim 3 was addressed by drawing on open-ended responses to prompts about participants&#8217; worries and actions related to climate change, focusing on a subsample of participants reporting elevated levels of CCA and probable GAD and/or MDD diagnoses based on their quantitative data. Due to the limited research on climate change anxiety and mixed evidence related to the role of activism in ameliorating or exacerbating distress, no specific hypotheses were warranted.</p>
