The role of the Barents-Kara sea ice loss is challenged by Blackport et&#160;al. (2019) who find a&#160;minimal influence of reduced sea ice on severe mid-latitude winters, and by Warner et&#160;al. (2020) who suggest that the apparent winter NAO response to the Barents-Kara sea ice variability is mainly an artefact of the Aleutian Low internal variability and of the co-variability between sea ice and the Aleutian Low originating from tropical-extratropical teleconnections. Also Gong et&#160;al. (2020) do not find a&#160;link between Rossby wave propagation into the mid-latitudes and Arctic sea ice loss. Mori et&#160;al. (2019) argue that models underestimate the influence of the Barents-Kara Sea ice loss on the atmosphere, which is disputed by Screen and Blackport (2019). Other studies have stressed the importance of atmospheric variability as a&#160;driver of Arctic variability (Lee, 2014; Woods and Caballero, 2016; Praetorius et&#160;al., 2018; Olonscheck et&#160;al., 2019). Analysing observed key variables of mid-latitude climate for 1980&#8211;2020, Blackport and Screen (2020b) and Riboldi et&#160;al. (2020) argue that the Arctic influence on mid-latitudes is small compared to other aspects of climate variability, and that observed periods of strong correlation are an artefact of internal variability or intermittency (Kolstad and Screen, 2019; Siew et&#160;al., 2020; Warner&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2020).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.05" top="522.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="522.6" x1="549.05" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.32; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An additional argument in the criticism is the inability of climate models to simulate a&#160;significant response to Arctic sea ice loss, larger than the natural variability (Screen et&#160;al., 2014; Walsh, 2014; H.W. Chen et&#160;al., 2016; Peings et&#160;al., 2017; Dai and Song, 2020), or that a&#160;very large multi-model ensemble is needed (Liang et&#160;al., 2020), although some studies find a&#160;significant response in summer, because then the internal variability is weaker (Petrie et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.15" top="462.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="462.6" x1="549.15" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 74.91; y0: 462.6; y1: 472.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Finally, a&#160;warmer Arctic climate can, without any additional changes in atmospheric dynamics, reduce cold extremes in winter due to advection of increasingly warmer air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes (Screen, 2014; Ayarzag&#252;ena and Screen, 2016; Ayarzag&#252;ena&#160;et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.04" top="414.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="414.6" x1="549.04" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Summarizing, different hypotheses have been developed about the influence of recent Arctic warming on the mid-latitudes in both winter and summer. Although some of the proposed mechanisms seem to be supported by various studies, the underlying mechanisms and relative strength compared to internal climate variability have been questioned. A&#160;recent review (Cohen et&#160;al., 2020) states that divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and also between different model studies, continue to obfuscate a&#160;clear understanding of how Arctic warming is influencing mid-latitude weather. In this context, Shepherd (2016b) stresses the need for collaboration between scientists with different viewpoints for further understanding that could be achieved by carefully designed, multi-investigator, coordinated, multi-model simulations, data analyses and diagnostics (Overland et&#160;al., 2016).

The AMV, PDV, ENSO (see Annex IV), upper tropospheric tropical heating, polar stratospheric vortex, and land surface processes associated with soil moisture (Miralles et&#160;al., 2014; Hauser et&#160;al., 2016) and snow cover (Nakamura et&#160;al., 2019; Sato and Nakamura, 2019) are a&#160;few examples. A&#160;considerable body of literature has shown that changes to the NAO/AO on seasonal and climate change time scales can be driven by variations in the wavelength and amplitude of Rossby waves, mainly of tropical origin (Fletcher and Kushner, 2011; Cattiaux and Cassou, 2013; Ding et&#160;al., 2014; Goss et&#160;al., 2016). The influence of future Arctic warming on mid-latitude circulation is difficult to disentangle from the effect of such a&#160;plethora of drivers (Blackport and Kushner, 2017; F. Li et&#160;al., 2018). One of the consequences of climate change is a&#160;poleward shift of the jet induced by the tropical warming (Barnes and Polvani, 2013), which is less obvious in winter especially over the North Atlantic (Peings et&#160;al., 2018; Oudar et&#160;al., 2020), and the increase of the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere, which increases storm track activity (Barnes and Screen, 2015; Parding et&#160;al., 2019). Although climate models indicate that future Arctic warming and the associated equator&#8211;pole temperature gradient decrease could affect mid-latitude climate and variability (Haarsma et&#160;al., 2013a; McCusker et&#160;al., 2017; Zappa et&#160;al., 2018), and even the tropics and subtropics (Deser et&#160;al., 2015; Cvijanovic et&#160;al., 2017; K. Wang et&#160;al., 2018; England et&#160;al., 2020; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020), they do not reveal a&#160;strong influence on extreme weather (Woollings et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="150.39" top="102.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="102.6" x1="150.39" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.17; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In conclusion, there is </span><span style="x0: 150.15; x1: 152.25; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="150.15" y0="102.6" x1="206.56">low confidence </span><span x0="206.32" y0="102.6" x1="549.13" style="x0: 206.32; x1: 208.43; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">in the relative contribution of Arctic warming to mid-latitude atmospheric changes compared to other drivers. Future climate change could affect mid-latitude variability in a&#160;number of ways that are still to be clarified, and which may also include the influence of Arctic warming. The linkages between the Arctic warming and the mid-latitude circulation are an example of contrasting lines of evidence that cannot yet be reconciled (Section&#160;10.5).</span></div></body></html>
