As a result of this mandate, donors, institutions, and funds established to provide climate finance to developing countries have developed tools and methodologies to ensure that the required attribution to climate change is well justified, traceable and calculated. While this serves the purpose of justifying a climate finance intervention and recording climate related financial flows, it poses significant challenges to the mainstreaming of addressing climate related risks in a project intervention. The additional analysis associated with climate finance result in high transaction costs, given that detailed technical assessments are necessary to justify the suitability of the funding for a given intervention and to validate the amount assessed. Such assessments include amongst others, sophisticated modelling, documentation of historical trends, and development of counterfactual baseline/alternative scenarios. This often makes climate finance inaccessible, both technically and financially, to public and private stakeholders that are not specialized in such analysis (Murphy &amp; Parry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>).</p>
