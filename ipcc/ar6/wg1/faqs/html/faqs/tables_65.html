As such, it is difficult to attribute a specific\ndisaster directly to climate change. However, the relatively new science of event attribution enables scientists to\nattribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes. Scientists cannot answer directly\nwhether a particular event was caused by climate change, as extremes do occur naturally, and any specific weather\nand climate event is the result of a complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists quantify the relative\nimportance of human and natural influences on the magnitude and/or probability of specific extreme weather\nevents.
