This could be in part due to limitations of the scale itself, since qualitative responses indicated a much broader repertoire of individual actions that participants were engaging in than those represented in the scale. At the same time, qualitative responses also reflected perceptions of the insignificance of individual action in the face of the immensity of the problems posed by climate change. Nevertheless, the majority of our sample reported engaging in individual actions to address climate change, and it is encouraging that these actions may be associated with lower levels of GAD.</p>
