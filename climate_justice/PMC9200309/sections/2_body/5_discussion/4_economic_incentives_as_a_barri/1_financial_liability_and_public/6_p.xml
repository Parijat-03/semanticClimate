<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <italic toggle="yes">McVeigh v Rest</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], the respondent sought information from his investment fund, about any actions the respondent was taking, regarding the financial risk posed to his investment by climate change. The court decided that funds have a duty to disclose information that allow the investor to make an informed decision about the investment in relation to such climate risk. Considering the shifting values as citizens on all continents witness climate catastrophes, and the emergence of global youth movements, consumer and social preferences are changing in favor of the environment, health, and well-being. Consequentially, banks, insurers and investment funds face increasing risks of litigation if their activities are not compliant with climate frameworks.</p>
