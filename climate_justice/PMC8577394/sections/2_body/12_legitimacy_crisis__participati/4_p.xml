In the previous plan, &#8220;the park was really sacrificial, it was gonna flood if we had that 100-year storm.&#8221; He expressed Parks&#8217; concern that the park would be increasingly lost to the community, as he went on: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to see with sea level rise, tidal inundation, where on a monthly or sometimes daily basis, you would see water coming over that coastal edge and flooding the park.&#8221; Another senior Parks official told me that the agency is not opposed to the approach of using parks as sponges, in theory, &#8220;but in New York we don&#8217;t have the budget for maintenance right now.&#8221; Yet another senior consultant on the ESCR told me a similar story: As the park increasingly floods, trees will be lost and will have to ripped out, and the park will have to remain closed while repairs take place, all at a recurring high expense for the Parks Department.</p>
