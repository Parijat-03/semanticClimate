Thirty-one of the 40 plans (78%) that incorporate justice were published between 2017 and 2021 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of the 22 plans published before 2017, only 22.7<italic>%</italic> articulated justice as an aspiration and 18.2% explicitly planned for justice. In contrast, of the 36 plans that were adopted between 2017 and 2021, 41.7% articulated justice as an aspiration and 44.4% explicitly planned for justice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Engagement with climate justice over time.</title><p>Number of cities in our sample that adopted or updated a climate action plan between 2007 and 2020.
