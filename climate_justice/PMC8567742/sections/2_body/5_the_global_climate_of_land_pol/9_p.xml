<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The hegemonic narrative of land tenure security has been operationalized in part through the mantra of &#8216;what is do-able&#8217; &#8211; that is, do-able within a given balance of social forces within the state and in society for or against redistributive land policy &#8211; and no longer daring to think about &#8216;what is possible&#8217;, which necessarily includes the need to disrupt the balance of social forces. This means that redistributive land policy has been eschewed, while what is perceived to be politically harmless and economically desirable &#8216;land tenure security&#8217; is celebrated and pursued. It also means the diminution of land politics: from redistributive land policies for class-based reforms for system change, to land tenure security for project-based social entrepreneurship for economic growth. The shift has stripped transformative land policy of its inherently irreverent and subversive political character, and has reduced policy to a tamed multistakeholder process aimed at finding a consensus at the centre (Li, <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; McKeon, <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is a shift from the class-relational zero-sum political process, into a positive-sum idea &#8211; firmly within the questionable win-win formula of <italic toggle="yes">WDR 2008</italic> (Oya, <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and the problematical win-win formula of the concept of &#8216;responsible agriculture investment&#8217; in response to land grabs (De Schutter, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
