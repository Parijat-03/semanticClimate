The role of private firms as political actors (cf. N&#233;ron, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2010</xref>) has become more important in understanding these regulatory trends. Private actors have evolved from &#8220;rule takers&#8221; to &#8220;rule makers&#8221;, often becoming directly involved in setting regulations, particularly through voluntary schemes (Andrade et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>; Bowen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). Burress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>) showed how firms may support or block impending regulations depending on their short- or mid-term perspective. At first their default reaction is to block or weaken regulations as unnecessary costs, but over time as it becomes clear that operational changes will be required, then, as long as the changes are the same for all and maintain a level playing field, firms can be persuaded to support regulation. A long-term perspective with clear targets and phasing in of new regulations is key to this change in perspective.</p>
