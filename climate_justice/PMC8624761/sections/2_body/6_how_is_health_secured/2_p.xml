<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Yet, our analysis shows that many low performing countries have existing UHC schemes and score above 70 on the UHC index of service coverage.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This same set of countries also scored within the top 50 of 195 countries in the 2019 GHSI.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> No clear pattern emerges when considering either the GHSI or UHC programmes as the determining indicator of country response. Even countries that score highly on GHSI and UHC have not necessarily been able to mitigate deaths from covid-19 (UK, US). Questions are raised about the appropriateness of these indices for determining and ranking countries&#8217; capacities to respond to and mitigate health emergencies.</p>
