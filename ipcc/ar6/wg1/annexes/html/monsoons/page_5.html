Lee et&#160;al., 2013). At interannual time scales, changes in East Asian summer monsoon intensity lead to a&#160;position shift of the monsoon rain belt under the influence of ENSO (Wang et&#160;al., 2000) and the western North Pacific subtropical high (Kosaka et&#160;al., 2013; Wang et&#160;al., 2013), Arctic sea ice (Guo et&#160;al., 2014), and solar and volcanic forcing (Peng et&#160;al., 2010; Man et&#160;al., 2012; Cui et&#160;al., 2014). Variability at inter-decadal time scales is more prominent in the second half of the 20th&#160;century (Jiang, 2005; Ding et&#160;al., 2008; Wang et&#160;al., 2018), and a&#160;specific assessment about this aspect is provided in Section&#160;8.3.2.4.2.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="534.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="534.6" x1="304.75">The basic features and interannual variations of the East Asian summer monsoon are well reproduced in climate models. For example, the climatological circulation structure is well reproduced in both atmospheric and coupled GCMs (Song and Zhou, 2013; Song et&#160;al., 2013; Jiang et&#160;al., 2016, 2020), and the relationship between the monsoon and ENSO is well represented (Sperber et&#160;al., 2013; Fu&#160;and Lu, 2017). In CMIP5 models, the main shortcomings relate to missing rainfall bands around 30&#176;N and the northward shift of the western North Pacific subtropical high (Huang et&#160;al., 2013). Most coupled models show an inadequate strength of monsoon circulation over southern East Asia, and with little change in model performance from the Third Assessment Report (TAR) to AR6 (Jiang et&#160;al., 2016, 2020). In coupled model simulations, air&#8211;sea coupling helps improve the climatology and interannual variability of rainfall over the East Asia monsoon region (Wang et&#160;al., 2005; Song and Zhou, 2014). </span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="342.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="342.6" x1="304.75">The summer (June&#8211;July&#8211;August) component of the EAsiaM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.2, 8.4.2.4.2, Atlas.5.1.2 and Atlas.5.1.4.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="216.18" top="306.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.43; y0: 306.48; y1: 316.48; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="306.48" x1="216.18">AV.4.2.2 The East Asian Winter Monsoon</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="282.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="282.6" x1="304.73">The East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is characterized by strong north-westerlies over north-east China, Korea and Japan, and by strong north-easterlies along the coast of East Asia (Huang et&#160;al., 2003). The northerly winds extend from mid-latitude East Asia to the equatorial South China Sea (Wen et&#160;al., 2000; Wang et&#160;al., 2010). The EAWM has one component mostly linked to mid-to-high latitude circulation systems and another mostly linked to the tropical circulation and largely controlled by ENSO (Ge et&#160;al., 2012; Chen et&#160;al., 2014a). The mid-latitude component has a&#160;close relationship with autumn Arctic sea ice concentration changes (Chen et&#160;al., 2014b).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="150.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="150.6" x1="304.73">The EAWM exhibits significant variability ranging from intra-seasonal to inter-decadal time scales. Its intra-seasonal variability is suggested to be influenced by both high-latitude and subtropical Eurasian wave trains (Jiao et&#160;al., 2019). At the interannual time scale, ENSO is an important factor modulating the EAWM (Wang et&#160;al., 2000), while the relationship between them is not stable (Wang and He, 2012; Fan et&#160;al., 2020).

In CMIP5 models, reasonable simulations of the Siberian High and Aleutian Low intensities and&#160;the relationship with ENSO help improve the climatology and interannual variability of the EAWM (Gong et&#160;al., 2014). </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="534.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.6; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="534.6" x1="563.28">Model simulations of the winter component of the EAsiaM are assessed in chapter Atlas.5.1.3.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="465.79" top="486.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.32; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: YIELBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="486.48" x1="465.79">AV.4.3 The West African Monsoon</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="462.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 462.6; y1: 472.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="462.6" x1="563.28">The West African monsoon (WAfriM) is a&#160;seasonal reversal in wind and precipitation extending over a&#160;vast and contrasted geographical region, from the equator to the margins of the Sahara, and from the Atlantic coast inland. The WAfriM domain includes Togo, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, Chad, Cape Verde, northern Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and the northern Central African Republic. It is roughly bounded by 18&#176;W&#8211;30&#176;E, 5&#176;N&#8211;18&#176;N, and is shaded grey in Figure AV.1 (e.g.,&#160;Adedokun, 1978). The West African monsoon and Sahel are sometimes considered interchangeably. However, the Sahel lies in the northern part of the WAfriM region, often limited to the west and central north Africa (e.g.,&#160;Nicholson et&#160;al. (2018) considered the domain to be 20&#176;W&#8211;30&#176;E, 10&#176;N&#8211;20&#176;N) or sometimes extended to the east (e.g.,&#160;Giannini and Kaplan (2019) considered the domain to be 20&#176;W&#8211;40&#176;E, 10&#176;N&#8211;20&#176;N). The East African region with the Greater Horn of Africa, which includes Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan, lies on the fringes of both the West African and Indian monsoons (Nicholson, 2017).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="234.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 234.6; y1: 244.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="234.6" x1="563.27">The WAfriM is characterized by the northward progression from May to September of moist low-level south-westerlies from the Gulf of Guinea, meeting the dry north-easterlies (Harmattan) from the Saharan Heat Low at the inter-tropical discontinuity (e.g.,&#160;Hamilton et&#160;al., 1945; Omotosho, 1988). In May and June, rainfall remains essentially along the Guinean coast with a&#160;maximum occurring near 5&#176;N, then the rainfall maximum jumps suddenly over the Sudan&#8211;Sahel zone near 12&#176;N, followed by a&#160;&#8216;little dry season&#8217; over the Guinea coast (Adejuwon and Odekunle, 2006). This apparent shift is known as the West African monsoon jump and it is concomitant with the monsoon onset over the Sahel (Sultan and Janicot, 2003; Cook, 2015). Rainfall continues to progress towards the north up to about 18&#176;N&#8211;20&#176;N. The rainfall maximum occurs in the Sahel in August/September, followed by a&#160;rapid retreat of rainfall to the Guinean coast and a&#160;second maximum occurs over this region </span></div></body></html>
