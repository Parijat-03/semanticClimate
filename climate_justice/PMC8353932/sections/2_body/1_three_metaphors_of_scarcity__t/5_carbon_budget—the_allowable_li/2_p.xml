<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par18">The concept of carbon budget was established by the scientific discovery of the near-linear relationship between CO<sub>2</sub>-induced temperature change and cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, often called the &#8216;transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions&#8217; or TCRE (MacDougall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). The linear property of TCRE allows a given temperature level to be linked <italic>directly</italic> to a fixed amount of cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This means that the challenge of meeting the 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C target can be quantified as the remaining amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be emitted into the atmosphere. As a carbon budget is calculated by climate models, it effectively translates the subjective meaning of &#8216;danger&#8217;, which is based on the expert judgement applied in the RFC framework, into a more objective, quantitative figure derived from mathematical modelling. Thus, the number of carbon budgets may appear more scientifically credible than the blurry colour of the burning embers.</p>
