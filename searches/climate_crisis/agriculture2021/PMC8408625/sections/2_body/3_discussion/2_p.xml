<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0165">To investigate the rise in WNV infections in Europe over the last 13 years (2007&#8211;2019), we compiled a unique spatial&#8211;temporal data-set including variables identified in the conceptual framework, following a thorough review of the literature. By taking this approach, we were able to carefully evaluate and adjust for environmental and economic factors that may have contributed to the recent rise in infections over the past decade or so. This study focuses on geographical factors which tend to influence the spread of the disease at the regional level, rather than trying to infer the determinants of the disease at the individual level.</p>
