While organizations seeking to persuade employees to drop out of unions claim some successes (Kamenetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>), data suggest relatively modest effects thus far. Reports, including one from the conservative Manhattan Institute, indicate that while fee payers have been eliminated, union membership has increased in some places (DiSalvo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>, 4; Rainey and Kullgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>; Reyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>). Overall, union membership in the public sector dropped by .3% between 2018 and 2019, from 33.9% of employed workers to 33.6% (BLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Nor does early evidence suggest substantial financial losses (Rainey and Kullgren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>; Reyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>). How did unions stave off the potential massive losses that some predicted would result from <italic>Janus</italic>?</p>
