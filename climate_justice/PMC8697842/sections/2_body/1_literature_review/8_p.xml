For example, Shahiduzzaman and Layton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) provided a decomposition analysis of GHG emissions in Australia for the period between 1990 and 2013. Utilizing the LMDI method, the researchers focused on the impacts of five determinants in GHG emissions: GHG intensity, energy intensity, structural change, wealth, and population. The authors concluded that Australia&#8217;s 2030 target of reducing the GHG emissions by 26&#8211;28% below the 2005 level would be very difficult to achieve if the mitigation efforts applied in the period between 2002 and 2013 continued until 2030. They also reported that if the reducing impacts of GHG intensity, energy intensity, and structural change factors for the period 2006&#8211;2013 could be continued until 2030, the mitigation target would be less difficult to achieve.</p>
