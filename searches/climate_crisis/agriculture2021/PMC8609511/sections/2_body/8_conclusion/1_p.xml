These precautions taken by the Indian Government could help limit the health crisis, but the complete lockdown has plunged the Indian economy into recession. India&#8217;s economic shock could be even more serious for two reasons. First, the economy slowed before COVID-19, exacerbating existing unemployment, low incomes, rural hardship, malnutrition, and general inequality. Second, India&#8217;s large informal sector is particularly vulnerable.</p>
