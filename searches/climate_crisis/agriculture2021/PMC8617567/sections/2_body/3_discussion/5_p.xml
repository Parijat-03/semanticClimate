Particularly, during the major wildfire season (August to September), more park visits and lower dwell time were found in parks away from wildfires in Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, and New Mexico. Moreover, we found the travel distances to park were positively correlated with the distance to wildfires during the wildfire season in most of the counties. This indicated that people closer to fires might avoid travel to parks nearby or travel long distance to parks away from wildfires. Previous studies found that wildfires are likely to have negative impacts on recreation, and those impacts could potentially last post&#8208;fire for a while (Flowers,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Loomis et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). However, some studies also suggested that people's curiosity about the wildfire events and their impacts can encourage their visitations close to wildfires (S&#225;nchez et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), especially for the areas where fires only occasionally occur. In places with a long history of wildfire records, people may be less interested in wildfires and not change their recreation behaviors during the wildfire seasons (e.g., keep visiting the parks or open spaces close to fires).</p>
