How will nature and the benefits it provides to people be affected by higher levels of warming?  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="537.42" top="556.13"><span style="x0: 43.0; x1: 50.1; y0: 556.13; y1: 568.13; width: 7.1; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAJ+ArialNarrow-BoldItalic;" x0="43.0" y0="556.13" x1="537.42">Healthy ecosystems and rich biodiversity underpin human survival. They provide countless services that make our Earth a habitable place. However, climate change and increases in extreme weather events are drastically and progressively impacting nature, weakening the structure, functioning and resilience of ecosystems. As a result, nature&#8217;s contributions to human well-being are diminishing, threatening sustainable and just development &#8211; now and in the future. </span></div><div left="43.0" right="516.74" top="481.49"><span x0="43.0" y0="481.49" x1="516.74" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 49.01; y0: 481.49; y1: 493.49; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">The world&#8217;s ecosystems on land, in freshwater and in the ocean provide a wide array of essential services to humans. They produce the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe. They filter our water, recycle nutrients and help to limit global warming by storing large amounts of carbon. Furthermore, they cool the air and offer &#8220;green&#8221; or &#8220;blue&#8221; spaces such as parks and lakes for fun, adventure and relaxation, thus improving our health and mental well-being. In short, healthy ecosystems are essential for human survival and make our Earth liveable.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="552.83" top="406.61"><span x0="43.0" y0="406.61" x1="552.83" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 50.1; y0: 406.61; y1: 418.61; width: 7.1; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Climate change &#8211; with its slow-onset events like sea level rise and ocean acidification and increases in extremes &#8211; is drastically and progressively affecting our world&#8217;s biodiversity and ecosystems. Increasing temperatures and extreme events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves are exposing plants and animals to climatic conditions not experienced for at least tens of thousands of years. Observed increases in their frequency and intensity are starting to exceed the ability of many species to adapt. Based on increased observations and a better understanding of processes, we now know that the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts on nature are greater than previously assessed. The impacts we see today are appearing much faster, they are more disruptive and more widespread than we expected 20 years ago. And we know that climate change is strongly adding to, and even amplifying, the other stressors: many of our world&#8217;s ecosystems are already facing a biodiversity crisis due to human impacts such as deforestation, pollution, overfishing and land-use change. For numerous ecosystems, climate change impacts are an additional stress and even a deadly burden, depending on the level of global warming.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="521.13" top="249.17"><span x0="43.0" y0="249.17" x1="521.13" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 52.29; y0: 249.17; y1: 261.17; width: 9.29; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">We see a growing number of scientific studies that present multiple lines of evidence showing climate change impacts. Increasing temperatures and extreme events change the seasonal timing of key biological events such as flowering, when animals emerge from hibernation,or annual migration, causing mismatches with important seasonal food sources. Examples include the timing of fish spawning and plankton blooms that fish larvae depend on for food, and insect availability at the time when birds are breeding.  </span></div><div left="43.0" right="527.68" top="174.29"><span x0="43.0" y0="174.29" x1="527.68" style="x0: 43.0; x1: 50.1; y0: 174.29; y1: 186.29; width: 7.1; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Changing climatic conditions, including warming, also progressively shift plants and animals to higher latitudes, higher elevations or deeper ocean waters. Approximately half of the many thousands of species studied on land and in the ocean already show corresponding responses, leading to climate-caused local population extinctions and shifts in vegetation zones. In the ocean, marine plants and animals including entire communities have shifted their distributions poleward at an average speed of 59 km per decade due to increasing water temperatures. Ocean acidification and decreasing oxygen in the water also play a part. Together all three processes have caused a reorganisation of biodiversity over the past 50 years, especially at the ocean surface. Those species that cannot adjust or move fast enough are at high risk of becoming extinct.  </span></div></body></html>
