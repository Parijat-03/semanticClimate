They highlight that climate impacts are likely to accentuate existing socioeconomic inequalities both within and between countries. Climate heating will result in enhanced physical risks such as wildfire, flooding, and drought, all of which we have seen in the past year, but these events will also have a mental health burden which will be largely hidden. A related piece from Harriet Ingle and co-authors explores the factors that influence peoples' experience of eco-anxiety. Importantly they note that many instances of eco-anxiety should not be categorised as mental illness, as they are often depicted in the media, but as a quite reasonable and adaptive response to an unfolding climatic crisis. Anxiety that leads to social mobilisation and activism of the kinds we have seen over the past 18 months or so may well be adaptive. Of course, this does not mean that we are all equally equipped to deal with such anxiety and there will be a need for mental health services to support the often-neglected mental health burden of environmental change. Danny Dorling reflects on the similarities between the activism we are seeing in response to the climate and biodiversity crises today and that from the era of nuclear proliferation and subsequent arms reduction. He notes that in both cases there seems to be a progression from ignorance to acceptance, then revulsion and rejection, but that new generations are required to aid and embrace the transition. A concerning point considering we only have 10 years to avert dangerous levels of climate heating being locked in for decades to come.</p>
