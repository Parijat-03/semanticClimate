Discussion about the role normative, mimetic, and coercive (regulatory) pressures might play in mainstreaming SBTs has been accompanied by descriptions of a few relevant initiatives (e.g., retailers engaging with suppliers on scope 3 emissions and government programs to support companies in setting SBTs), but systematic assessments of the effectiveness of such initiatives are lacking. There are debates about whether voluntary SBTs will enable more ambitious climate policy. Overall, the literature does not provide a compelling case that the voluntary approach will be sufficient for aligning the private sector to the Paris Agreement.</p>
