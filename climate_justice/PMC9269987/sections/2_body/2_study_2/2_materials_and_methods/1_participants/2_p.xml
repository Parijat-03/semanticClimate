<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The final sample of Study 2 comprised 880 participants with 454 females and 426 males (age <italic>M</italic> = 50.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.0, range = 18&#8211;84 years). Two &#967;<sup>2</sup>-tests checked whether the age and gender groups of the reduced sample were still in line with the predefined quotas. We found no significant deviation from the proportions set for the recruiting procedure, either for gender, &#967;<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.89, <italic>p</italic> = 0.345 or for age group, &#967;<sup>2</sup>(5) = 9.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.109. Therefore, the final sample can still be regarded as representative of the German adult population in terms of age and gender (also see <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>
