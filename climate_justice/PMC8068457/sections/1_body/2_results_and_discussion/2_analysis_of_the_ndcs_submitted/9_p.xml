To some extent, this excess use could be read as an appropriation of the atmospheric space that should be available for the developing countries. This reaffirms the view that the authors have previously mentioned: that the high-income Mediterranean countries (the EU27 group and Israel) should notably increase the ambition of their NDCs in order to make them not only compatible with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global scenario but also to contribute to implementing the PA on the basis of equity.</p>
