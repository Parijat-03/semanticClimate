Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns and the resulting changes in vector ecology; contaminated drinking water as a result of extreme weather events; and air pollution, all contribute to the increased rates of the aforementioned diseases, exacerbated by food and water scarcity and resulting malnutrition. Children are not only physiologically vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but their vulnerability is exacerbated by their reliance on adults for survival and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Up to 175 million children are affected by climate disasters every year, and children make up a third of refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs) and asylum-seekers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Illness and climate-related displacement at a young age can have devastating impacts on a child&#8217;s education, development, safety and psychological well-being, the burden of which they may carry for the rest of their lives.</p>
