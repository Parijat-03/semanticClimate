Insurance instruments (Sections&#160;7.4.2 and 7.4.6) can take many forms (traditional indemnity based, market-based crop insurance, property insurance), and some are linked to livelihoods sensitive to weather as well as food security (linked to social safety-net programmes) and ecosystems (coral reefs and mangroves). Insurance instruments can also provide a framework for risk signals to adaptation planning and implementation and facilitate &#64257;nancial buffering when climate impacts exceed current capabilities delivered through both public and private &#64257;nance (Bogale 2015b; Greatrex et al. 2015; Surminski et al. 2016). A holistic consideration of all instruments responding to extreme impacts of climate change (drought, &#64258;ood, etc.) is required when assessing if policy instruments are promoting livelihood capitals and contributing to the resilience of people and communities (Hurlbert 2018b). This holistic consideration of policy instruments leads to a consideration of risk governance (Section&#160;7.6).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.93; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="495.55" x1="307.58">Early warning systems are critical policy instruments for protecting lives and property, adapting to climate change, and effecting adaptive climate risk management (</span><span style="x0: 154.87; x1: 159.45; y0: 471.56; y1: 481.06; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="154.87" y0="471.56" x1="211.71">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 211.71; x1: 214.35; y0: 471.56; y1: 481.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="211.71" y0="471.56" x1="307.54">) (Selvaraju 2011; Cools et al. 2016; Travis 2013; Henriksen et al. 2018; Seng 2013; Kanta Ka&#64258;e 2017; Garcia and Fearnley 2012). Early warning systems exist at different levels and for different purposes, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&#8217; Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS-NET), national and local extreme weather, species extinction, community-based &#64258;ood and landslide, and informal pastoral drought early warning systems (Kanta Ka&#64258;e 2017). Medium-term warning systems can identify areas of concern, hotspots of vulnerabilities and sensitivities, or critical zones of land degradation (areas of concern) (see Chapter 6) critical to reduce risks over &#64257;ve to 10 years (Selvaraju 2012). Early warning systems for dangerous climate shifts are emerging, with considerations of rate of onset, intensity, spatial distribution and predictability. Growing research in the area is considering positive and negative lessons learned from existing hazard early warning systems, including lead time and warning response (Travis 2013).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="231.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="231.58" x1="307.58">For effectiveness, communication methods are best adapted to local circumstances, religious and cultural-based structures and norms, information technology, and local institutional capacity (Cools et al. 2016; Seng 2013). Considerations of governance or the actors and architecture within the socio-ecological system, is an important feature of successful early warning system development (Seng 2013). Effective early warning systems consider the critical links between hazard monitoring, risk assessment, forecasting tools, warning and dissemination (Garcia and Fearnley 2012). These effective systems incorporate local context by de&#64257;ning accountability, responsibility, acknowledging the importance of risk perceptions and trust for an effective response to warnings.
