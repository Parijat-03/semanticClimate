Traditionally, risk management is performed through multifunctional landscape approaches in which resource utilisation is planned across wide areas and local agreements on resource access. Multifunctionality permits vulnerable communities to access various resources at various times and under various risk conditions (Minang et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="627.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="627.12" x1="307.57">In many countries, governmental compensation for crop-failure and financial losses are used to protect against risk of severe yield reductions.

Diversified cropping systems and practicing traditional agroecosystems of crop production where a&#160;wide range of crop varieties are grown in various spatial and temporal arrangements, are less vulnerable to catastrophic loss (Zhu et al. 2011). The use of local genetic diversity, soil organic matter enhancement, multiple-cropping or poly-culture systems, home gardening, and agroecological approaches can build resilience against extreme climate events (Altieri and Koohafkan&#160;2008). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="339.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 339.12; y1: 348.62; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="339.12" x1="307.6">However, Nie et al. (2016) argued that while integrated crop-livestock systems present some opportunities such as control of weeds, pests and diseases, and environmental benefits, there are some challenges, including yield reduction, difficulty in pasture-cropping, grazing, and groundcover maintenance in high rainfall zones, and development of persistent weeds and pests. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="255.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 255.13; y1: 264.63; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="255.13" x1="307.55">Adaptation measures based on agroecology entail enhancement of agrobiodiversity; improvement of ecological processes and delivery of ecosystem services. They also entail strengthening of local communities and recognition of the role and value of ILK. Such practices can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agricultural systems by buffering climate extremes, reducing degradation of soils, and reversing unsustainable use of resources; outbreak of pests and diseases and consequently increase yield without damaging biodiversity. Increasing and conserving biological diversity such as soil microorganisms can promote high crop yields and sustain the environment (Schmitz et al. 2015; Bhattacharyya et al. 2016; Garibaldi et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.56" top="99.15"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 99.15; y1: 108.65; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="99.15" x1="307.56">Diversification of many components of the food system is a&#160;key element for increasing performance and efficiency that may translate into increased resilience and reduced risks (integrated land management systems, agrobiodiversity, ILK, local food systems, </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.16"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.62; y0: 735.16; y1: 744.66; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.16" x1="566.12">dietary diversity, the sustainable use of indigenous fruits, neglected and underutilised crops as a&#160;food source) (</span><span style="x0: 488.33; x1: 495.19; y0: 723.16; y1: 732.66; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="488.33" y0="723.16" x1="561.18">medium confidence</span><span style="x0: 561.18; x1: 563.82; y0: 723.16; y1: 732.66; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="561.18" y0="723.16" x1="566.1">) (Makate et al. 2016; Lin 2011; Awodoyin et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="687.16"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 687.16; y1: 696.66; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="687.16" x1="566.08">The more diverse the food systems are, the more resilient they are in enhancing food security in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses. Diverse production systems are important for providing regulatory ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, soil erosion control, reduction of GHG emissions and control of hydrological processes (Chivenge et al. 2015). Further options for adapting to change in both mean climate and extreme events are livelihood diversification (Michael 2017; Ford et al. 2015), and production diversity (Sibhatu et al. 2015). </span></div></body></html>
