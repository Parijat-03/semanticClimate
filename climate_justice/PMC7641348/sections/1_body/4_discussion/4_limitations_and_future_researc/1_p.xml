<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Vulnerability is difficult to capture fully given its complexity and nuances. As a tension in this work, it is challenging to apply concepts of vulnerability consistent with existing literature and policies while remaining cognizant of and prioritizing the ongoing feedback from communities. Here we relied on language and scientific precedent set by California and the IPCC. However, California environmental justice communities often feel disempowered by these traditional framings of vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other limitations of this work include the use of only two other vulnerability indices and examination at the census tract level, which may mask important household-level differences. Further, HHAI is not a percentile-based index so our framing of the &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; threshold was for comparison purposes only. Finally, the diversity of impact and award amount of CCI-funded projects was not considered in the analysis.</p>
