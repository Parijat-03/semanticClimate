The IPCC de&#64257;nition of &#8216;technology transfer&#8217; includes transfer of knowledge and technological cooperation (see Glossary) and can include modi&#64257;cations to suit local conditions and/or integration with indigenous technologies (Metz et al. 2000). This de&#64257;nition suggests greater heterogeneity in the applications for climate mitigation and adaptation, especially in land-use sectors where indigenous knowledge may be important for long-term climate resilience (Nyong et al. 2007). For land-use sectors, the typical reliance on trade and patent data for empirical analyses is generally not feasible as the &#8216;technology&#8217; in question is often related to resource management and is neither patentable nor tradable (Glachant and Dechezlepr&#234;tre 2017) and ill-suited to provide socially bene&#64257;cially innovation for poorer farmers in developing countries (Lybbert and Sumner 2012; Baker et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="276.1" top="507.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 507.55; y1: 517.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="507.55" x1="276.1">Technology transfer has contributed to emissions reductions (</span><span style="x0: 276.1; x1: 282.96; y0: 507.55; y1: 517.05; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="276.1" y0="507.55" x1="307.57">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 98.41; x1: 101.05; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="98.41" y0="495.55" x1="307.56">). A detailed study for nearly 4000 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects showed that 39% of projects had a stated and actual technology transfer component, accounting for 59% of emissions reductions; however, the more land-intensive projects (e.g., afforestation, bioenergy) showed lower percentages (Murphy et al. 2015). Bioenergy projects that rely on agricultural residues offer substantially more development bene&#64257;ts than those based on industrial residues from forests (Lee and Lazarus 2013). Energy projects tended to have a greater degree of technology transfer under the CDM compared to non-energy projects (Gandenberger et al. 2016). However, longer-term cooperation and collaborative R&amp;D approaches to technology transfer will be more important in land-use sectors (compared to energy or industry) due to the time needed for improved resource management and interaction between researchers, practitioners and policymakers. These approaches offer longer-term technology transfer that is more dif&#64257;cult to measure compared to speci&#64257;c cooperation projects; empirical research on the effects of R&amp;D collaboration could help to avoid the &#8216;one-policy-&#64257;ts- all&#8217; approach (Ockwell et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.53" top="255.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 255.57; y1: 265.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="255.57" x1="307.53">There is increasing recognition of the role of technology transfer in climate adaptation, but in the land-use sector there are inherent adoption challenges speci&#64257;c to adaptation, due to uncertainties arising from changing climatic conditions, agricultural prices, and suitability under future conditions (Biagini et al. 2014).

While the rules for the implementation of the new mechanisms are still under development, lessons from REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) may be useful, which is perceived as more democratic and participative than the CDM (Maraseni and Cadman 2015). Experience with REDD+ programmes emphasise the necessity to invest in &#8216;readiness&#8217; programmes that assist countries to engage in strategic planning and build management and data collection systems to develop the capacity and infrastructure to participate in REDD+ (Minang et al. 2014). The overwhelming majority of countries (93%) cite weak forest sector governance and institutions in their applications for REDD+ readiness funding (Kissinger et al. 2012). Technology transfer for advanced remote sensing technologies that help to reduce uncertainty in monitoring forests helps to achieve REDD+ &#8216;readiness&#8217; (Goetz et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="279.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 279.59; y1: 289.09; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="279.59" x1="566.09">As well as new opportunities for &#64257;nance and support, the Paris cooperation mechanisms and the associated roles for technology transfer bring new challenges, particularly in reporting, verifying and accounting in land-use sectors. Since developing countries must now achieve, measure and communicate emission reductions, they now&#160;have value for both developing and developed countries in achieving their NDCs, but reductions cannot be double-counted (i.e., towards multiple NDCs). All countries have to prepare and communicate NDCs, and many countries have included in their NDCs either economy-wide targets that include the land-use sectors, or speci&#64257;c targets for the land-use sectors. The Katowice climate package clari&#64257;es that all Parties have to submit &#8216;Biennial Transparency Reports&#8217; from 2024 onwards, using common reporting formats, following most recent IPCC Guidelines (use of the 2013 Supplement on Wetlands is encouraged), identifying key categories of emissions, ensuring time-series consistency, and providing completeness and uncertainty assessments as well as quality control (UNFCCC 2018a; Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019). In total, the ambiguity in how countries incorporate land-use sectors into their NDC is estimated </span></div></body></html>
