Sandel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2012b</xref>: 92) argues that it is not possible to produce &#8220;a general principle that can tell us, once and for all, which goods should be bought and sold on the market&#8221;. Many criticisms of Sandel relate to a lack of evidence that any alternative would be better or a proposed method to select the alternatives. In the case of emissions, however, there is an alternative that does not require allocating emissions, which is to ban emissions of carbon by a certain date and leave the technical responses to the market.</p>
