<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0095">Climate change is perhaps the direst long-term crisis the world is facing today. It is widely known that its effects are majorly felt by the poor communities. Given the extra burdens rural women experience due to gender barriers, it is conceivable that they are among the hardest hit by this crisis. The agricultural sector and by extension food systems, are highly climate-sensitive, hence most threatened by the impact of climate change, particularly due to the increase in the incidences of climate variability (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Mendelsohn, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007</xref>). Climate change has a direct effect on agricultural yields which in turn impacts food prices, reliability of food delivery, quality and safety (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Hertel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Lobell and Field, 2007</xref>). Also, the effect of climate change on water availability and access leads to disastrous consequences (<xref rid="bb0570" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Hanjra and Qureshi, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Piao et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, placing additional burden to the food system given water is an important part of food utilization. According to <xref rid="bb0555" ref-type="bibr">Vermeulen et al. (2012)</xref>, &#8216;preexisting and emerging social and economic conditions&#8217; influences how climate change impacts food systems. These include the discriminatory socio-economic situation that women are subjected to due to their gender. They not only exacerbate how women are impacted by climate change, but also affect their ability to adapt and mitigate related effects.</p>
