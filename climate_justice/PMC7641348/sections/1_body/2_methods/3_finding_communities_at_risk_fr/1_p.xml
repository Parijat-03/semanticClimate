<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In our analysis, relative and absolute extreme heat metrics were used to capture the diverse relevant forms of heat exposure. Temperature data selection and preparation matched that done in California&#8217;s Fourth Climate Change Assessment [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We used Localized Constructed Analog downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 temperature data downloaded from Cal-Adapt, a government run API portal, and humidity data from the University of California San Diego&#8217;s archive [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We downloaded daily maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and minimum relative humidity data for each tract from these sources. The four climate models highlighted in the state assessment were selected: HadGEM2-ES, CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, and MIROC5. Our study considers three time periods: historical (1950&#8211;1999), current (2006&#8211;2025), and projected (2040&#8211;2059). The current period uses data from the four climate models. All periods consider data between April 1<sup>st</sup> and October 31<sup>st</sup>, given the focus on extreme heat. We used a moderate emissions scenario only (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) given overlapping climate projections across scenarios over the next few decades [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. By the end of the century, however, divergence across scenarios is more substantial. At present, global emissions and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts are not in line with the moderate trajectory, and without increasing stringency of emissions reductions, global warming and associated climate change impacts would exceed this trajectory in the longer term.</p>
