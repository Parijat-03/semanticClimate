Rather than proposing far-fetched policy recommendations for more transformational and more just politics in the EU bioeconomy policy domain, in what follows I reflect upon the process of change and risks of co-optation, with a hope to inspire decolonial and just socioecological transformations in and beyond bioeconomy.</p>
