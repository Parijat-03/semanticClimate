The projected 8 temperature change (5.4&#176;C ) is higher during winter (December to February) than during summer monsoon  9 (June-September) season (4.9&#176;C) by the end of 21st century under the RCP8.5 high emissions scenario  10 (Sanjay et al., 2017c, 2017d). However, less agreement was found among these RCMs on the magnitude of 11 future warming over other hilly sub-regions within the HKH for both seasons. In particular, there is higher 12 RCM uncertainty in the climate projections over the hilly parts of central Himalaya. Over the Indian 13 Himalayan region, an assessment of future temperature changes in four CORDEX RCMs indicated 14 statistically significant strong rates of warming (increasing with intensification of greenhouse gas emission 15 RCP scenarios) of about 0.03&#8211;0.09&#176;C per year (Dimri et al., 2018a), but with large spatial variations and 16 inter-model spread (</span><span style="x0: 145.86; x1: 153.78; y0: 569.39; y1: 580.37; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="145.86" y0="569.39" x1="231.06">medium confidence</span><span x0="231.06" y0="569.39" x1="41.44" style="x0: 231.06; x1: 234.71; y0: 569.39; y1: 580.37; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). Further, there is a higher warming rate (0.23&#8211;0.52&#176;C per decade) 17 for both minimum and maximum air temperature (Tmin and Tmax) along with the diurnal temperature range 18 (DTR) predominated by rise of the Tmax as compared to Tmin (Dimri et al., 2018b) over the region under 19 both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Overall temperature across the mountainous HKH will increase by 20 about 1&#8211;2&#176;C (and in some places by up to 4&#8211;5&#176;C) by 2050 (Shrestha et al., 2015) and will increase up to 5.5 21 &#177; 1.5 &#176;C by the end of the 21st century. For RCP4.5 this change will be 2.5 &#177; 1.5 &#176; C (van Vuuren et al., 22 2011).  23 24 Results from the CMIP5 models suggest that the projected changes in the surface mean temperature over the 25 HKH are larger compared to the global mean change by the end of the 21st century. The projected warming 26 differs by more than 1&#176;C between the eastern and western HKH, with relatively higher values in winter 27 (Sanjay et al., 2017b). The projected temperature changes with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for time slices 28 of 2036&#8211;65 and 2066&#8211;95 relative to 1976&#8211;2005 in three HKH subregions suggest that during summer 29 (winter) relatively higher (lower) warming will occur over the hilly regions of the north-western Himalaya 30 and Karakoram (HKH1) than in the central Himalaya (HKH2) and south-eastern Himalaya and TP (HKH3) 31 (Wester et al., 2019). In general, future projections of surface temperature from the CMIP5 models and 32 CORDEX RCM seem to agree on the overall warming trends over the HKH region with differences in 33 magnitude (Wester et al., 2019). 34 35 The summer monsoon precipitation will intensify by about 22% in the hilly sub-region within the south-36 eastern Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau for the far-future period under the RCP8.5 scenario (Krishnan et al., 37 2019b). CMIP5 GCM projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios show summer monsoon rainfall increase 38 over the Himalayas (Palazzi et al., 2015). Three different hydrological models tested over snow and glacier-39 covered river basins of Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore using CORDEX RCM-simulations for future scenarios 40 showed an increase in precipitation but decline in intensity of rise over high-altitude zones, for the period 41 2071&#8211;2099 (2090s) under the RCP8.5 scenario with significant increase in snow- glacier-melt runoff and 42 precipitation runoff in the Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore-River basins, respectively (Azmat et al., 2019). 43 Another result from a regional climate model (PRECIS) over a river basin scale (Indus Basin) did not show 44 any trends in precipitation changes in the future in the western HKH (Rajbhandari et al., 2015). However, in 45 the eastern Himalaya (Koshi Basin), for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, a 10&#8211;20% increase in rainfall 46 during the summer monsoon and about a 5% increase in the winter season over the trans-Himalayan part of 47 the basin was observed (Rajbhandari et al., 2016). Unlike temperature, the precipitation response to climate 48 change over the HKH region is subject to larger uncertainties both in the CMIP5 and CORDEX models 49 (Dimri et al., 2018; Hasson et al., 2013, 2015; Mishra, 2015a; Sanjay et al., 2017b). The CORDEX RCM, in 50 particular, still have inherent limitations in reproducing the observed characteristics of the summer monsoon 51 rainfall variability (Singh  et al., 2017), and future projections of precipitation extremes are unresolved, both 52 across studies and across regions (Palazzi et al., 2013).   53 54 Figure Atlas.49: show projected changes in temperature (c,e) and precipitation (d,f) over the HKH region  55 </span></div></body></html>
