At a protest in East River Park in late 2019, Howard, a white middle-aged activist, stood before the crowd and asked into a microphone: &#8220;What do we call a climate plan that will bulldoze our park and bury it under eight or ten feet of dirt, while ripping up a thousand trees and keeping the cars on the highway?&#8221; After nobody filled his expectant pause he offered his own answer: &#8220;A stupid plan!&#8221; Two new neighborhood groups, East River Alliance and East River Park Action, formed to organize events and mobilize activists in opposition to new plan. The Councilwoman representing Community District 3, Carlina Rivera, and Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer both withdrew their support for the plan for the first few months. The first breaking of ground in East River Park was supposed to take place in the early autumn of 2019, but continues to be delayed into late spring 2021 at the time of writing.</p>
