These SUHI intensity data have a downscaled 300 M resolution and this level likely results in much of the spatial variation at the census tract level being lost, especially in urban areas. Landsat or a finer resolution Earth observation sensor is superior to MODIS for intra-city SUHI intensity studies but lacks the temporal resolution and spatial coverage necessary for a large-scale spatiotemporal study. Utilizing a finer resolution dataset, one could relatively easily incorporate a series of images for a specific city and examine local disparities through time. Results from the current study could be used to identify cities primed for such analysis.</p>
