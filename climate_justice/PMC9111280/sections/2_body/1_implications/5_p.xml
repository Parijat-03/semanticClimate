It is primarily comprised of three components (Binita et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>): exposure to the weather&#8208;climate extreme, sensitivity, and the ability to bounce back (adaptive capacity). A robust body of literature (Hoffman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Shepherd,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) has established that racial discrimination, redlining, segregation, and economic disparities increase the vulnerability of certain groups to weather&#8208;climate extremes. In an urbanized society, extreme heat and spatially related disparities have disproportionate health and economic impacts on communities of color and the poor.</p>
