Through our subjectivity analysis of the top 20 users based on followers, we see a large range of subjectivity. We believe this provides unique insight into whether particularly impactful accounts are more likely to tweet factual or objective information vs a subjective opinion, and based on these data, a user can make a better informed decision to follow a particular individual or account. We do, however, recognize the potential for a few accounts to dominate conversations and stifle alternative opinions and interpretation of data and therefore caution users to be mindful of this possibility.</p>
