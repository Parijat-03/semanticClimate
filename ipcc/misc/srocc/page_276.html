Half of the region&#8217;s irrigated lands, especially in the Amudarya and Syrdarya river basins, were affected by secondary salinisation (Qadir et al. 2009). Le et al. (2016) showed that about 57% of croplands in Kazakhstan and about 20% of croplands in Kyrgyzstan had reductions in their vegetation productivity between 1982 and 2006. Chen et al. (2019) indicated that about 58% of the grasslands in the region had reductions in their vegetation productivity between 1999 and 2015. Anthropogenic factors were the main driver of this loss in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, while the role of human drivers was smaller than that of climate-related factors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan (Chen et al. 2019). The total costs of land degradation in Central Asia were estimated to equal about 6&#160;billion USD annually (Mirzabaev et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.27" top="495.56"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 495.56; y1: 505.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="495.56" x1="307.27">Damberg and AghaKouchak (2014) found that parts of South Asia experienced drying over the last three decades. More than 75% of the area of northern, western and southern Afghanistan is affected by overgrazing and deforestation (UNEP-GEF 2008). Deserti&#64257;cation is a&#160;serious problem in Pakistan with a&#160;wide range of human and natural causes (Irshad et al. 2007; Lal 2018). Similarly, deserti&#64257;cation affects parts of India (Kundu et al. 2017; Dharumarajan et al. 2018; Christian et al. 2018). Using satellite data to map various deserti&#64257;cation processes, Ajai et al. (2009) found that 81.4 Mha were subject to various processes of deserti&#64257;cation in India in 2005, while salinisation affected&#160;6.73 Mha in the country (Singh 2009). </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="351.57"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 351.57; y1: 361.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="351.57" x1="307.29">Saudi Arabia is highly vulnerable to deserti&#64257;cation (Ministry of Energy Industry and Mineral Resources 2016), with this vulnerability expected to increase in the north-western parts of the country in the coming decades. Yahiya (2012) found that Jazan, south-western Saudi Arabia, lost about 46% of its vegetation cover from 1987 to 2002. Droughts and frequent dust storms were shown to impose adverse impacts over Saudi Arabia, especially under global warming and future climate change (Hasanean et al. 2015). In north-west Jordan, 18% of the area was prone to severe to very severe deserti&#64257;cation (Al-Bakri et al. 2016). Large parts of the Syrian drylands have been identi&#64257;ed as undergoing deserti&#64257;cation (Evans and Geerken 2004; Geerken and Ilaiwi 2004). Moridnejad et al. (2015) identi&#64257;ed newly deserti&#64257;ed regions in the Middle East based on dust sources, &#64257;nding that these regions accounted for 39% of all detected dust source points. Deserti&#64257;cation has increased substantially in Iran since the 1930s. Despite numerous efforts to rehabilitate degraded areas, it still poses a&#160;major threat to agricultural livelihoods in the country (Amiraslani and Dragovich 2011). </span></div><div left="59.24" right="91.43" top="123.6"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 123.6; y1: 133.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="59.24" y0="123.6" x1="91.43">Australia</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="99.6"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 99.6; y1: 109.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="99.6" x1="307.29">Damberg and AghaKouchak (2014) found that wetter conditions were experienced in northern Australia over the last three decades with widespread greening observed between 1981 and 2006 over much of Australia, except for eastern Australia where large areas </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.78" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 324.28; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 6.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.61" x1="565.78">were affected by droughts from 2002 to 2009 based on Advanced High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data (Donohue et al. 2009). For the period 1982&#8211;2013, Burrell et al. (2017) also found widespread greening over Australia including eastern Australia over the post-drought period. This dramatic change in the trend found for eastern Australia emphasises the dominant role played by precipitation in the drylands. Degradation due to anthropogenic activities and other causes affects over&#160;5% of Australia, particularly near the central west coast. Jackson and Prince (2016) used a&#160;local NPP scaling approach applied with MODIS derived vegetation data to quantify degradation in a&#160;dryland watershed in Northern Australia from 2000 to 2013. They estimated that 20% of the watershed was degraded. Salinisation has also been found to be degrading parts of the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia (Rengasamy 2006). Eldridge and Soliveres (2014) examined areas undergoing woody encroachment in eastern Australia and found that rather than degrading the landscape, the shrubs often enhanced ecosystem services. </span></div><div left="317.77" right="345.2" top="519.64"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.17; y0: 519.64; y1: 529.14; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="317.77" y0="519.64" x1="345.2">Europe </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.82" top="495.64"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 323.22; y0: 495.64; y1: 505.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="495.64" x1="565.82">Drylands cover 33.8% of northern Mediterranean countries: approximately 69% of Spain, 66% of Cyprus, and between 16% and 62% in Greece, Portugal, Italy and France (Zdruli 2011). The European Environment Agency (EEA) indicated that 14 Mha, that is&#160;8% of the territory of the European Union (mostly in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain and Portugal), had a&#160;&#8216;very high&#8217; and &#8216;high sensitivity&#8217; to deserti&#64257;cation (European Court of Auditors 2018). This &#64257;gure increases to 40 Mha (23% of the EU territory) if &#8216;moderately&#8217; sensitive areas are included (Pr&#259;v&#259;lie et al. 2017; European Court of Auditors 2018). Deserti&#64257;cation in the region is driven by irrigation developments and encroachment of cultivation on rangelands (Safriel 2009) caused by population growth, agricultural policies, and markets. According to a&#160;recent assessment report (ECA 2018), Europe is increasingly affected by deserti&#64257;cation leading to signi&#64257;cant consequences on land use, particularly in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania.
