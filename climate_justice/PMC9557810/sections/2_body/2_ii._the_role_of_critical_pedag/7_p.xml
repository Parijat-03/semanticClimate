<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">According to Sara Motta, the critical pedagogies underpinning popular urbanism do not
aim to create an <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;alternative monological practice of life&#8221;</italic>, but
rather aim for the <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;pedagogical [to] become an essential part of creating
the openings, possibilities and relationships to enable communities that are
often silenced and violently invisibilised to appear as embodied political
subjects&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn17-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">17</xref>)</sup> To achieve this end, learning through, with and in
struggle, requires a pedagogy that transgresses the rules and boundaries of the
classroom as a site of learning and <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;instead embed[s] educational practice
in multiple spaces: the community, the workplace, the co-operative, the home,
the self&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn18-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">18</xref>)</sup> Moreover, the content of learning is co-constructed rather
than being based on predefined curricula, which is responsive to context-specific
urban knowledges of learner-pedagogues as well as to the inequalities and injustices
the learning process seeks to confront. As argued by Motta, for learning to become
emancipatory, pedagogical practice needs to be the <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;product of praxis at the
collective level of lived experience&#8221;</italic>,<sup>(<xref rid="fn19-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">19</xref>)</sup> in which counter-hegemonic
knowledges and (hi)stories of resistance and hope are cultivated.</p>
