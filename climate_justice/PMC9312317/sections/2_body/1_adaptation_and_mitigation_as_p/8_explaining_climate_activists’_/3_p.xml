Kleres and Wettergren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>) argue for instance that in Northern CCMs, emotions like fear and hopelessness are seen as unproductive and that &#8216;feeling rules&#8217; therefore keep them out of strategizing. By contrast, Casseg&#229;rd and Th&#246;rn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>) emphasize that postapocalyptic narratives may sound defeatists at first, but are seen by some to produce hope through the acceptance of loss and the imagination of what is possible after the apocalypse. Following this argument, adaptation can be seen as an &#8216;optimistic&#8217; project. Nonetheless, those who feel more hopeless about the effectiveness of climate action will presumably consider greater impacts of climate change to be likely and may therefore attribute greater weight to adaptation. By contrast, those who feel more positive in this regard may feel that major impacts of climate change can still be prevented and will therefore (continue to) prioritize mitigation (Roser-Renouf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>). The first hypothesis this paper will test is therefore that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par22"><italic>H1: Hopelessness is related to greater support for climate adaptation.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
