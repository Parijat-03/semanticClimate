The Paris Climate Agreement of 2016 made clear that time is of the essence in reducing carbon emissions if we are to limit additional global warming to no more than, at a minimum, 2 degrees Celsius. But the agreement did not stop there; it put forward an even bolder challenge of maintaining a 1.5-degree warming threshold if we hope to avoid <italic>catastrophic</italic> climate change. Five years later, without the development of any substantial <italic>global</italic> mitigation strategies, it is now evident that the point of no return has already passed for the 1.5-degree threshold and that in less than a decade the point of no return for the 2-degree minimum threshold will pass as well (Sorab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>).</p>
