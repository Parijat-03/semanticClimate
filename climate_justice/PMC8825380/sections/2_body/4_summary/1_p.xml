Such ceilings have the function of restricting agents&#8217; capabilities if required to allow others to reach the thresholds. In some cases, but not all, the ceilings are equivalent to the threshold, meaning that an agent is just entitled to reach (but not pass) the threshold so that others can reach it. Drawing on Holland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>), we also stipulated tragic and non-tragic choices&#8212;the former being instances when it is impossible to push someone above the threshold without simultaneously pushing someone else below the threshold.</p>
