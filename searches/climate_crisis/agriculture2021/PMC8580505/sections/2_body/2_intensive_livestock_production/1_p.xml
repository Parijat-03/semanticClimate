As livestock production practices are increasingly intensified globally, livestock and poultry are kept in increasingly crowded conditions, and, in some cases, are bred with higher genetic homogeneity, enhancing their vulnerability to pathogens.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Movement of people between farms and urban areas also increases with agricultural intensification, including livestock production, which further increases the risk of transmission events.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>
