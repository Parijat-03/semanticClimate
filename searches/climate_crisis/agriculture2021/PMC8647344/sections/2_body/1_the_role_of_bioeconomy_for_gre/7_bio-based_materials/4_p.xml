Bio-based materials can also be generated by valorizing the organic fractions of waste and leftovers with different biorefinery approaches. These include biomass refining into bio-crude and ethanol through chemical or hydrothermal fragments rich in lignocellulosic components (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Miliotti et al., 2019</xref>) and integrating pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion in cascading facilities to generate biochar and biomethane, respectively (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Casini et al., 2019</xref>). Biomass cascading includes also preferring the utilization of wood to manufacture durable products that live longer, prioritizing the utilization of sawdust and chops (leftovers from the wood industry) for useful recycling purposes, such as the production of innovative products, and energy generation with combustion. This approach requires optimal forest management for wood processing, the utilization of wood products in service, and leftovers' valorization (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
