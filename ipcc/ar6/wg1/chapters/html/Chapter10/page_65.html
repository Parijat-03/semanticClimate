Guo et&#160;al., 2019), albeit with only small (less than 30%) area fraction with robust change. Robust changes in tropical and subtropical regions only appear from GWLs of 1.5&#176;C, for example in south-western South America (Boisier et&#160;al., 2016), western Africa (Hawkins et&#160;al., 2020; Section&#160;10.4.2.1) and southern Australia (Delworth and Zeng, 2014). Substantial (taken here simply as area fraction greater than 50%) emergence only occurs in some tropical, subtropical and mid-latitude regions when high GWLs (3&#176;C&#8211;4&#176;C) are reached. Importantly, even at these high GWL values, there are still a&#160;large number of these regions with robust changes covering less than 50% of their area. In contrast, most high-latitude regions have an area fraction with robust changes greater than 80% at GWLs of 3&#176;C and above.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.7" top="546.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="546.6" x1="304.7" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 64.25; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">We now illustrate the potential influence of internal variability on late or lack of emergence for a&#160;few AR6 land regions (Figure&#160;10.15b). For each of these AR6 regions, the time evolution of the percentage area with robust annual mean precipitation change is estimated for both the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble and the three coupled SMILEs used throughout Chapter&#160;10. Similarity in percentage area time evolution between CMIP6 and the three coupled SMILEs suggests that internal variability can substantially influence the timing of emergence. For example, internal variability could explain the mid-21st&#160;century emergence (percentage area greater than 50%) of the drying and wetting signal over the Mediterranean and South Asia (see also Section&#160;10.6.3) regions, respectively. Internal variability can also&#160;contribute to the late and moderate emergence over South-Eastern South America (see also Section&#160;10.4.2) and West South Africa (see also Section&#160;10.6.2). In contrast, it cannot explain the lack of robust changes (percentage area less than 30%) over Western Africa at the end of the 21st&#160;century, suggesting that model differences are also contributing to the lack of emergence (Monerie et&#160;al., 2017a, b). In addition to different forced signals, the differences of time evolution between the three SMILEs, in particular for African regions, point to the issue of global model performance in accurately representing internal variability and its future changes. While overestimation and underestimation of internal variability in current models have been reported (Eade et&#160;al., 2014; Laepple and Huybers, 2014), methodological challenges to assess the magnitude and spatial pattern of model biases in simulating internal variability, still remain (Section&#160;10.3.4.3). Therefore, the existence of model biases and the limited knowledge of their characteristics lead to limitations about a&#160;precise quantification of internal variability influence on delayed regional-scale emergence.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="86.63" top="174.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="174.6" x1="86.63" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 86.69; x1: 91.27; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="86.69" y0="174.6" x1="146.03">high confidence </span><span x0="146.09" y0="174.6" x1="304.71" style="x0: 146.09; x1: 148.91; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that consistency in definitions of signal and noise, choice of the reference period and signal-to-noise threshold, is important to robustly assess the future emergence of anthropogenic signals across different types or generations of models, as well as comparing past emergence results between observations and models.

An overview of the different sources used for developing regional climate information is given in Section&#160;10.5.1. The role of the user context in the construction of climate information is assessed in Section&#160;10.5.2. The distillation to combine multiple lines of evidence is assessed in Section&#160;10.5.3. Finally, climate services in the context of regional climate information are assessed in Section&#160;10.5.4. The role of storylines in constructing climate information is assessed in Box&#160;10.2. The assessment of how regional climate information is distilled in the report is treated in Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.3, whereas the assessment of information on regional, physical climate processes that impact society or ecosystems, termed climatic impact-drivers (Section&#160;10.1), appears in Chapter&#160;12, as well as more information on climate services in Cross-Chapter Box&#160;12.2.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="438.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="438.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The rise in demand for relevant regional climate information (Hewitt et&#160;al., 2012, 2020; Louren&#231;o et&#160;al., 2016) has resulted in diverse approaches to produce it. Historically, the construction of climate information has been embedded in a&#160;linear supply chain: extracting the source data, processing into maps or derived data products, preparing the material for communication, and delivering to users (Section&#160;10.1.4). Typical products are open-access, web-portal delivery services of data (Hewitson et&#160;al., 2017), which may also be implemented as commercialized climate services (Webber and&#160;Donner, 2017). Such a&#160;chain, although it is intended to meet a&#160;demand for regional climate information, contains many assumptions that are not obvious to the recipients and that may introduce possible misunderstandings in the handover from one community to the next (Meinke et&#160;al., 2006; Lemos et&#160;al., 2012). In recognition that data is not necessarily relevant information, a&#160;new pathway towards a&#160;tailored distillation of climate information has emerged. The construction of information assessed in this section draws on multiple sources (Figure&#160;10.16), whereby the context framing for an application is addressed through co-design with users. The constructed information is then translated into the context of the user taking into account the values of all actors involved (Sections&#160;10.5.2 and 10.5.3, and Figure&#160;10.1).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="524.71" top="150.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.41; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="150.48" x1="524.71">10.5.1 Sources of Regional Climate Information</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="126.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional climate information may be constructed from a&#160;diverse range of sources, each depending on different assumptions and affected by different methodological limitations (Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4).
