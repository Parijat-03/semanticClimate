There are about 3.4 billion people in the rural regions of the world (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2018</xref>), of which about 1.6 billion are dependent on forests, to some degree, to maintain their lifestyle (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 2015</xref>) To arrive at a per capita calculation for the emissions generated from land use change, a population must be determined. If we use this 1.6 billion; thus, blaming only forest dependent people, forest users would have an average of 2.85&#160;t per capita per year, which is still significantly less than the average air traveler, and they are generally not considered the main culprits of land use change (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Nolte et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rend&#243;n and Morales, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, emissions in rural regions and logging communities are generally less than national averages (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Jurjonas &amp; Seekamp, 2019</xref>). For example, Mexico, Tanzania, and India&#8211;which have realized resource conflict with federal governments and illegal logging as a result of stricken land rights&#8211;have 4.00&#160;t, 1.7&#160;t, and 0.2&#160;t annual per capita CO2 emissions rates, respectively (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2015</xref>).</p>
