In some way, the IPCC can be seen as providing the cultural resources for communicating climate change in society. These scientific evaluative devices created for IPCC assessment are &#8216;boundary objects&#8217; (Star and Griesemer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1989</xref>) that facilitate communication across different cultural spaces, travelling from scientific publications to policy documents to media coverage. They eventually become a primary vantage point from which people come to understand the challenge of climate change. IPCC assessment may not necessarily prescribe a specific policy, but it does fixate our way of knowing the climate problem to a specific viewpoint (Borie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>).</p>
