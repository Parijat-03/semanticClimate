<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A notable shift is currently underway: children/youth are increasingly engaging in risk reduction, community climate adaptation, and mitigation initiatives, and policy discussions [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notable trends are the &#8220;Greta Effect&#8221; [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], FridaysforFuture [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], climate strikes, BirthStrike [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and the civil lawsuit filed by children/youth against the federal government. Children/youth are also reaching out to talk with family members, teachers, and community groups about their experiences of distress, alienation and urgency [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, many adults are actively seeking guidance on how to respond, indicating that many climate conversations cannot yet be had between generations [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Children/youth continue to grapple with their thoughts about the future. They have a unique capacity to perceive risks that are particular to their age and circumstances, and to propose child- and youth-friendly ways to overcome them [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Because of this, children/youth can offer ideas that may help to resolve challenges to local infrastructure, offer insights into children and youth&#8217;s behaviors and resources to help strengthen community early warning systems, increase climate change awareness amongst their peer groups and with their families, and even model how to take doable, local actions on climate change that make a notable difference [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. When governments, health care services, and communities enable and support their participation, children/youth can and do meaningfully contribute [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Climate change is irrevocably transforming their world; therefore, supporting the agency of children/youth to participate in developing creative solutions and resilient responses is appropriate and timely [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
