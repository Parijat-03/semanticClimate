To detect this kind of cough, Ferrari et al. [<xref rid="B67-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] fixed 1 m multi-directional microphones of 50 to 16,000 Hz around a farm. The microphone was connected to a laptop, and animal cough sound patterns were recorded, digitized, and analyzed using Matlab 7. Having earlier injected healthy animals with citric acid, acoustic parameters such as time difference between coughs, peak frequency, and root mean square were used to differentiate coughs from a healthy pig from those of infected ones. While healthy pigs relaxed for about 52 s after each cough attack, the infected pigs coughed after every 37 s. Peak frequency for infected and non-infected pigs was observed to be 1600 Hz and 600 Hz, respectively.</p>
