nursing education, Jane Harden argues that <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;everyday living as
experienced by the majority is characterised by a naive, pre-reflective
adherence to &#8216;established&#8217; versions of the life world. The consequence of
this is that &#8216;factual&#8217; or doxic patterns of living are never challenged, and
the question of legitimacy is never raised, because the social world is
presented and accepted as a natural phenomenon&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn38-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">38</xref>)</sup> In this
sense, a critical parallel can be established between nursing and urban planning
education. For a long time, professional education, in this and other fields,
has hampered critical awareness and responses from learners, inadvertently
turning professions of care into professions of oppression. In the case of
nursing education, the dismissal of emancipatory capacities has indeed turned it
into a site of oppression for those practising the profession, typically women,
who are subordinated to a subservient role.</p>
