Evidence on climate-driven internal migration shows that moving has mixed outcomes on risk reduction and adaptive capacity. On one hand, migration can improve adaptive capacity by increasing incomes and remittances as well as diversifying livelihoods (Maharjan et&#160;al., 2020); on the other, migration can expose migrants to new risks. For example, in Bangalore (India), migrants often face high exposure to localised flooding, insecure and unsafe livelihoods, and social exclusion, which collectively shape their vulnerability (Michael et&#160;al., 2018; Singh and Basu, 2020). In greater Manila (the Philippines) and Chennai (India), planned relocations to reduce disaster risk have often exacerbated vulnerability, due to relocation sites being in environmentally sensitive areas, inadequate livelihood opportunities and exposure to new risks (Meerow, 2017; Ajibade, 2019; Jain et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="42.94" right="256.39" top="474.63"><span style="x0: 42.94; x1: 47.5; y0: 474.63; y1: 484.13; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="42.94" y0="474.63" x1="256.39">10.4.6.4.5 Disaster management and contingency planning</span></div><div left="42.94" right="296.64" top="450.64"><span x0="42.94" y0="450.64" x1="296.64" style="x0: 42.94; x1: 47.16; y0: 450.64; y1: 460.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is rich case-based evidence across Asia on urban adaptation to extreme events with relatively more evidence on rapid-onset events such as cyclones and flooding than slow-onset disasters such as drought (see Box&#160;10.6; Ray and Shaw, 2019; UNESCAP, 2019; Singh et&#160;al., 2021a). Overall, there has been a growing emphasis on &#8216;build back better&#8217; interventions (Mannakkara and Wilkinson, 2013; Hallegatte et&#160;al., 2018) that approach disaster management holistically through infrastructural solutions such as climate-resilient housing or sea walls and soft approaches such as strengthening livelihoods, developing EWS</span><span x0="103.62" y0="346.76" x1="108.94" style="x0: 103.62; x1: 106.28; y0: 346.76; y1: 352.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">11</span><span x0="108.94" y0="342.6" x1="296.65" style="x0: 108.94; x1: 111.22; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">,increasing awareness about disaster risks and impacts, and building local capacities to deal with them (Bhowmik et&#160;al., 2021).

Depending on context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/or Indigenous knowledge. These EWS are also considered for ecological applications (e.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not threatened by hazard but the ecosystem under conservation is; an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (e.g., warnings of ground frost and hailstorms) and in fisheries (e.g., storm and tsunami warnings) (IPCC, 2018a).</span></div><div left="307.13" right="558.57" top="714.6"><span x0="307.13" y0="714.6" x1="558.57" style="x0: 307.13; x1: 313.99; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">media (Carley et&#160;al., 2016), are proving effective for disaster prepared- ness, relief and recovery. Community-based DRR is consistently rank-ed as most effective for its role in transforming DRR towards being more context relevant and inclusive. Ecosystem-based DRR (EbDRR) is also gaining prominence and includes strategies such as mangrove plantation and rejuvenation in vulnerable coastal areas. Nature-based solutions for flood protection and reducing drought incidence have emerged as an alternative to costlier &#8216;hard&#8217; infrastructure (UN-Water, 2018; Zevenbergen et&#160;al., 2018; Rozenberg and Fay, 2019). Some cities are also reporting adaptation to heat risk. For example, Ahmedabad (India) has pioneered preparedness for extreme temperatures and heatwaves by developing annual Heat Action Plans, building regula-tions to minimise trapping heat, advisories about managing heat stress and instituting a cool-roofs policy (Ahmedabad Municipal, 2018).</span></div><div left="307.13" right="560.86" top="534.63"><span x0="307.13" y0="534.63" x1="560.86" style="x0: 307.13; x1: 311.18; y0: 534.63; y1: 544.13; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Financing, regulations and institutional processes play a significant role in incentivising DRR and resilience in large-scale, city-level built infrastructure by the private sector and other actors. Currently there are gaps in these mechanisms, leading to infrastructure development in disaster-prone areas, increasing exposure to people, property, economy and systems (Jain, 2013). Both firms and governments need to take disaster risks into consideration in supply-chain management to avoid disruptions and subsequent negative effects (Abe and Ye, 2013). There are several institutional challenges faced during DRR and CCA implementation including overlapping efforts and inefficient use of scarce resources due to inappropriate funding mechanisms, a lack of coordination and collaboration, a lack of implementation and mainstreaming, scale mismatches, poor governance, the social&#8211;political&#8211;cultural structure, competing actors and institutions, and lack of information, communication, knowledge sharing, and community involvement, as well as policy gaps (Seidler et&#160;al., 2018; Islam et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="307.13" right="494.37" top="318.48"><span x0="307.13" y0="318.48" x1="494.37" style="x0: 307.13; x1: 311.93; y0: 318.48; y1: 328.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.6.5 Enabling Urban Adaptation Across Asia</span></div><div left="307.13" right="560.86" top="294.6"><span x0="307.13" y0="294.6" x1="560.86" style="x0: 307.13; x1: 311.35; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is growing empirical evidence of conditions enabling and constraining urban adaptation (Table&#160;10.3) with relatively more literature from South, Southeast and East Asia.
