Of these professionals, the vast majority are from affluent, middle-class backgrounds, many having attended independent or public schools, and so being well connected within the British &#8216;establishment&#8217; including the environmental and wildlife film-making sector. These types of links cannot be underestimated, whatever your ethnic background.</p>
