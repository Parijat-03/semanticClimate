<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One gap that needs a closer look in the literature relates to the engagement with the material aspects of mitigation and adaptation. This gap was already identified in the first wave of research (e.g., Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), but it never became fully formulated as a theme within the literature, and both the first and the second wave of climate change research in urban areas have overlooked it.</p>
