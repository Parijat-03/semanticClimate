Climate change has been socially constructed crisscrossed by public and private interests, social disputes, asymmetries and world-view conflicts. Its potential effects affect both material and ideational dimensions of social relations, stretching to different scales, degrees, territories and policy areas. The historical experiences of the climate agenda have crafted at least two fundamental aspects, which are based on a political and ideological rhetoric led by particular challenges that generate contradictions across the field in contemporary negotiations. First, we observe a dispute over the subject-matter itself, both in terms of narratives about its existence,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> causalities and impacts (Lahsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>; Dryzek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>; Chakrabarty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>), as well as in terms of public policy responses, regulations and development models. Second, when it comes to the legitimacy of norms and the implementation of rules to address both the complexities of social conditions of vulnerability and effective actions to fulfil distributive and climate justice principles, climate change still faces a discrepancy between political announcements and incongruous practices.</p>
