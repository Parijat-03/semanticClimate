Considering that coal, oil, and gas made up approximately 80 per cent of the global primary energy sources in 2017 (Valentine et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>: 2), raising the energy availability for A, B, or C would simultaneously entail increasing the burning of fossil fuels. In turn, this would increase the risk of dangerous climate change for future generations. If energy use is a prerequisite for capabilities, those that consume too much are committing a wrong <italic>if</italic> their usage limit the energy use required for others&#8217; capabilities thresholds. If energy use does not limit others reaching above the threshold, then ceilings are not motivated. Applying the capabilities ceiling, it would not be beyond the scope of justice to limit energy usage of those consuming high levels, where the limitation does not push any agent below the thresholds of entitlements; rather, it is a non-tragic choice. Such limitations are also found elsewhere in climate justice, such as Caney&#8217;s suggestion of a fair quota and a duty to not breach that quota, and a right to emit for the least advantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>), or Shue&#8217;s discussion on luxury emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]).</p>
