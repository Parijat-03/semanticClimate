Women&#8217;s adaptive capacity is also diminished\nbecause their work often goes unrecognised (Rao 2005;\nNelson and Stathers 2009). Many of women&#8217;s activities\nare not defined as &#8216;economically active employment&#8217; in\nnational accounts (FAO 2011a). This non-economic status\nof women&#8217;s activities implies that they are not included\nin wider discussions of priorities or interventions for climate\nchange. Their perspectives and needs are not met; and\nthus, interventions, information, technologies, and tools\npromoted are potentially not relevant, and even can increase\ndiscrimination (Alston 2009; Edvardsson Bj&#246;rnberg and\nHansson 2013; Huynh and Resurreccion 2014).</td>

Thus, corresponding institutional frameworks\nthat are well-resourced, coordinated, and informed are\nrequired, along with adequate technical capacity within\ngovernment agencies, NGOs and project teams, to strengthen\ncollaboration and promote knowledge sharing (Aipira et al.\n2017).</td>
