Model A showed multicollinearity, and Models A and B heteroscedasticity. As a linear model can be considered robust (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2013</xref>), it was nevertheless used in this study. The regression tables of Models A and B are provided in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>
