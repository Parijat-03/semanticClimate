<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The focus here is on the types of needs that the poorest and most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts have addressed in their NDC submissions. What specific support do they require or rely on from the developed world in order to transition from business as usual (BAU) to carbon neutral development in LDPCs? For instance, what kind of technology do they need to safeguard their countries from climate risks? What is the hierarchy of needs, and are there any shared or common needs where the LDPCs are looking for support from the developed world? In a nutshell, what are their climate action needs to achieve their NDC targets for climate risk reduction and GHG emission reduction for sustainability transitions?</p>
