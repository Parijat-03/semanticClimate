Litigation is evidently evolving as a specific tool for climate legal action. Early cases tended to present environmental destruction as the central concern and framed climate change as a peripheral or secondary issue. The 2020 climate litigation snapshot found climate change to be &#8220;at the centre of the legal argument&#8221; in about 41% of cases, whereas in the remaining 59% climate change was classified as a &#8220;peripheral issue&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
