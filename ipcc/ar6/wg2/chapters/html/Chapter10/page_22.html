Assisted migration of species should be considered for isolated habitats as mountain summits or where movements are constrained by poor dispersal ability. Introducing seeds of the species to new regions will help to protect them from the extinction risk caused by climate change (Mazangi et&#160;al., 2016). In Asian boreal forests, a strategy and integrated programmes should be developed for adaptation of the forests to global climate change, including sustainable forest management, firefighting infrastructure and forest fuel management, afforestation, as well as institutional, social and other measures in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 &#8216;Life on Land&#8217; (Isaev and Korovin, 2013; Kattsov and Semenov, 2014; Bae et&#160;al., 2020). Improvements in forest habitat quality can reduce the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Choi et&#160;al., 2021). Adaptation options for freshwater ecosystems in Asia include increasing connectivity in river networks, expanding protected areas, restoring hydrological processes of wetlands and rivers, creating shade to lower temperatures for vulnerable species, assisted translocation and migration of species (Hassan et&#160;al., 2020; Chapter 2). Reduction of non-climate anthropogenic impacts can enhance the adaptive capacity of ecosystems (Tchebakova et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="42.38" right="210.25" top="102.48"><span style="x0: 42.38; x1: 47.58; y0: 102.48; y1: 112.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="42.38" y0="102.48" x1="210.25">10.4.3 Ocean and Coastal Ecosystems</span></div><div left="42.38" right="296.07" top="78.6"><span x0="42.38" y0="78.6" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.38; x1: 47.48; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Coastal habitats of Asia are diverse, and the impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, ocean acidification and SLR, are known to affect the services and livelihoods of the people depending on them. </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.31" top="414.61"><span x0="306.56" y0="414.61" x1="560.31" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 310.78; y0: 414.61; y1: 424.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The risk of irreversible loss of many marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2&#176;C or more (</span><span style="x0: 542.13; x1: 546.71; y0: 402.61; y1: 412.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="542.13" y0="402.61" x1="560.25">high confidence</span><span x0="345.45" y0="390.61" x1="560.24" style="x0: 345.45; x1: 348.09; y0: 390.61; y1: 400.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (IPCC, 2018b). In the South China Sea, coral growth and sea surface temperature (SST) have shown regional long-term trends and inter-decadal variations, while coral growth is predicted to decline by the end of this century (Yan et&#160;al., 2019). Increasing human impacts have also been found to reduce coral growth (Yan et&#160;al., 2019). In the South China Sea, nearly 571 coral species have been severely impacted by global climate changes and anthropogenic activities (Huang et&#160;al., 2015a).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.27" top="282.62"><span x0="306.56" y0="282.62" x1="560.27" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 310.78; y0: 282.62; y1: 292.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The 2014&#8211;2017 global-scale coral bleaching event (GCBE) resulted in very high coral mortality on many reefs, rapid deterioration of reef structures and far-reaching environmental impacts (Eakin et&#160;al., 2019). The thermally tolerant Persian Gulf corals (Coles and Riegl, 2013) are facing an increasing frequency of mass bleaching (Riegl et&#160;al., 2018) and each event leaves a substantial long-term impact on coral communities (Burt, 2014) with low capacity for recovery indicating a bleak future for Persian Gulf reefs (Burt et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.29" top="174.64"><span x0="306.56" y0="174.64" x1="560.29" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 312.38; y0: 174.64; y1: 184.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">One of the probable results of global warming is high SLR. Scientists believe that increasing GHGs (the Earth&#8217;s temperature controllers) is the cause of this global warming, and by using satellite measurements, these scientists have forecasted on average 1&#8211;2 mm for SLR (Jafari et&#160;al., 2016). The level of thermal stress (based on a degree heating month index, DHMI) at these locations during the 2015&#8211;2016 El Ni&#241;o was unprecedented and stronger than previous ones (Lough et&#160;al., 2018). In the Persian Gulf, the reef-bottom temperatures in 2017 were among the hottest on record, with mean daily maxima averaging 35.9 &#177; 0.10&#176;C across sites, with hourly temperatures reaching as high as 37.7&#176;C (Riegl et&#160;al., 2018).

The inhabitants of each of these settlements have experienced a decline in dust storms in recent decades, since the late 1980s at Nouakchott, since 2004 at Zabol and since the late 1970s at Minqin. Iran is mostly arid or semiarid, with deserts making up at least 25&#160;million hectares of the country (NASA, 2018). Iran is experiencing unprecedented climate-related problems such as drying of lakes and rivers, dust storms, record-breaking temperatures, droughts and floods (Vaghefi et&#160;al., 2019). There are three key factors responsible for the generation of sand and dust storms: strong wind, lack of vegetation and absence of rainfall (EcoMENA, 2020). It seems that all of this is closely related to the heating surface and the occurrence of local dry instabilities (Ghasem et&#160;al., 2012). According to EcoMENA (2020), sand and dust storms cause significant negative impacts on society, the economy and the environment at the local, regional and global levels. The seasonality of the numbers of dusty days (NDD) in Iran shows the highest frequency in summer followed by spring and autumn (Modarres and Sadeghi, 2018). In the past decade, West Asia has witnessed more frequent and intensified dust storms affecting Iran and other Persian Gulf countries (Nabavi et&#160;al., 2016). In terms of long-term frequency of dust events, observational analyses show an overall rising trend of the frequency of Iran&#8217;s dust events in recent years (Alizadeh-Choobari et&#160;al., 2016). Results show that there has been a direct relationship between dust event, drought and years of intensive drought (Dastorani and Jafari, 2019).

The slope of precipitation in West Asia shows that during the period 2016&#8211;2045 in January, February, July and August, precipitation would increase and decrease in other months of the year (Ahmadi et&#160;al., 2018). Temperatures in Central Asia have risen significantly within recent decades, whereas mean precipitation remains almost unchanged (Haag et&#160;al., 2019); however, climatic trends can vary greatly between different sub-regions, across altitudinal levels and within seasons (Haag et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div></body></html>
