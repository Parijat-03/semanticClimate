actors and actions. In our analysis of users&#8217; comments, we found the list of
actors to include the government, society, individual/or personal actors, and
the global (or international) community. We also identified political, economic,
and health-related types of actions to be associated with the aforementioned
actors. Despite our findings, we expect the list of actors and actions to expand
depending on the context of future research. In the next section, we shed light
on the remaining group of comments concerning readers&#8217; evaluations of the
models.</p>
