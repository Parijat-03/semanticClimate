<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0002">Brazil is currently suffering from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148468/brazil-battered-by-drought" id="interref0002">worst drought</ext-link> in over 100 years. Additionally, many conserved areas throughout the country such as the Amazon forest and the Pantanal wetlands are burning to the ground mostly due to anthropogenic activities. With an increase in global temperatures, fires worsen, with a direct impact on pollution and rain production. To ameliorate the situation, some of the Brazilian Government's responses to extinguish the fires in August, 2021, consisted of training army men, investing in helicopters and planes, and forbidding the use of fires in the areas for 120 days. These reactive measures were inadequate as more than 700&#8197;000 hectares were already consumed by the fire in the Pantanal area alone since January 2021. In 2020, more than 20,000 animals died in fires, and the number is still unknown for 2021. Now, as summer approaches in the southern hemisphere, the consequences of inaction kick in: Brazil, one of the richest countries in water resources, is in a critical water crisis. The expected rains did not occur this year, which have a direct impact, not only on water and energy supply, but also for all the biomes throughout the country.</p>
