      <td>Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature\nincluding that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase\n(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from\nillustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)2 scenarios, respectively3. Climate\nimpacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some\nrecent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding\nsocioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as\nappropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are\nmany emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range\nof possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII\nalso assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios\nare analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs2. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including\nimpacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6\nSPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, WGI AR5}</td>

Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.\n4 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.\n5 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements\nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1&#176;C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\n6 Global warming of 1.5&#176;C relative to 1850&#8211;1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report\n(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021&#8211;2040), the 1.5&#176;C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded\nunder the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5&#176;C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary\novershoot of no more than 0.1&#176;C above 1.5&#176;C global warming.</td>
