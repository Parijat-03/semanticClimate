<p>Developing human relationships refers to a number of activities. In the first place, it
refers to the interpersonal relationships between workers and service users and between workers
themselves. <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Gillinson (2017)</xref> writes about
&#8216;incentivising a new balance between risk management and relational support&#8217; (no
page number) and advocates a focus on preventative, empathetic and creative approaches. Equally
important is the reality that meaningful human relationships facilitate social work advocacy
and intervention in the policy process. <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Healy (2017)</xref>
reminds us that social workers can &#8216;be the bridge&#8217; (p. 13) between the
individuals and groups with whom they work and decision-makers. In order to occupy this bridge
social workers need to engage with communities &#8216;in the initial (re)claiming and
(re)framing of problems, rather than during the later policy making stages&#8217; (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barretti, 2019</xref>, p. 39). Social workers&#8217; engagement
with policy-making processes needs to be built from the bottom up and not from the top down. It
is through connecting with and understanding services users&#8217; experiences that social
workers can identify and sketch paths to policy engagement and influence, not through
identifying policy as something objective, separate and &#8216;other&#8217;. This crucial
aspect of practice has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic when evidence suggests that
social and community workers across the globe have worked to develop systems, networks and
supports for communities in crisis, prompting the suggestion that social work is
&#8216;returning to its community-based roots&#8217; (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Truell, 2020</xref>, online).</p>
