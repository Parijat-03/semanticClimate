It is pertinent not only to identify clinical factors related to the disease in individuals, but also to identify environmental factors related to the incidence and mortality in the population. The objective of this research is to study the association between chronic exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> and health indicators of COVID-19, such as the incidence and mortality rate, at the communal level while taking into account the population, housing, and climate characteristics of each commune. The study&#8217;s rationale is to provide local evidence to health authorities, politicians, and society about the effects of air pollution on the current pandemic.</p>
