The CO-enriched surface ocean water is transported to the deep ocean in specific zones\n2\naround the globe (such as the Northern Atlantic and the Southern Ocean), effectively storing the CO away from\n2\nthe atmosphere for many decades to centuries.

The land carbon sink is more challenging to monitor globally, because it varies widely, even\nregionally. There is currently no direct evidence that the natural sinks are slowing down, because observable\nchanges in the fraction of human emissions stored on land or in oceans are small compared to year-to-year\nand decadal variations of these sinks. Nevertheless, it is becoming more obvious that atmospheric and climate</td>

Under future\n2\nhigh-warming scenarios, it is expected that the global ocean and land sinks will stop growing in the second\nhalf of the century as climate change increasingly affects them. Thus, the total amount of CO emitted to the\n2\natmosphere and the responses of the natural CO sinks will both determine what efforts are required to limit\n2\nglobal warming to a certain level (see FAQ 5.4), underscoring how important it is to understand the evolution of\nthese natural CO sinks.\n2</td>
