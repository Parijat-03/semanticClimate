In some cases, a&#160;purpose may be best served using several types of information together. For example, when model data is the primary source, it can be advantageous to employ data from multiple models or even from a&#160;range of different experiment types (Section&#160;10.3.2) supported by assessing how the models reflect changes in driving processes. In this manner a&#160;purpose may be best served by seeking the congruence of several types of information together, though one needs to recognize how well the attributes of each source align with the specific need for information. Depending on resources, one may even design model experiments specifically for a&#160;given use, such as constructing physical climate storylines of individual events (Section&#160;10.3.2 and Box&#160;10.2). Such analyses may be complemented by event attribution studies (Section&#160;11.1.4).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="414.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="414.6" x1="304.72" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.32; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Users of climate information may face the so-called practitioner&#8217;s dilemma: a&#160;plethora of different and potentially contrasting sources (Figure&#160;10.16) may be available without a&#160;comprehensive and user-relevant evaluation, and these datasets may also lack a&#160;transparent and easily understandable explanation of underlying assumptions, strengths and limitations (Barsugli et&#160;al., 2013; Hewitson et&#160;al., 2017). Often, the choice of information source is therefore not determined by what is most relevant and informative for the question at hand, but rather by practical constraints such as accessibility and ease of use and may be limited to the availability of just one source in extreme cases (R&#246;ssler et&#160;al., 2019a).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="244.51" top="258.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 258.48; y1: 268.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="258.48" x1="244.51">10.5.2 Framing Elements for Constructing User-Relevant&#160;Information</span></div><div left="56.69" right="230.24" top="222.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="222.48" x1="230.24" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 222.48; y1: 232.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.2.1 Consideration of Different Contexts</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="198.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="198.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 64.25; y0: 198.6; y1: 208.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Without considering the specific context, the distillation of climate information relevant to users may poorly serve the goal of informing adaptation and policy (Cash et&#160;al., 2003; Lemos et&#160;al., 2012; Baztan et&#160;al., 2017). Section&#160;10.1.4 identifies three implicit framing issues of constructing and delivering user-relevant climate information: practical issues arising from the climate information sources, issues with including the context in constructing the information, and difficulties presented by complex networks of practitioners. The social context strongly influences decisions about constructing information and requires a&#160;nuanced and holistic approach to recognize the complexity of a&#160;coupled social and physical system (Daron et&#160;al., 2014). For example, urban water managers must recognize the dependency of the city on different water resources and the interplay </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.61; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">a&#160;range of different constituencies and decision makers (Scott et&#160;al., 2018; Savelli et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="678.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="678.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.31; y0: 678.6; y1: 688.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Context plays a&#160;role in determining the risks that may affect human systems and ecosystems and consequently the climate information needs. The context may also limit access to such information. Hence, the context imposes inherent constraints on how climate information can be constructed and optimally aligned with its intended application. Although contexts are unlimited in variety, some key contextual elements include:</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="582.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="582.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.96; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">&#8226; Whether the problem formulation needs to be constructed through consultative activities that, for instance, help identify thresholds of vulnerability in complex urban or rural systems (Baztan et&#160;al., 2017; Willyard et&#160;al., 2018) or is more a&#160;matter of addressing a&#160;generic vulnerability already identified, such as the frequency of flood events or recurrence intervals of multi-year droughts (Hallegatte et&#160;al., 2013).&#8226; Societal capacity, such as cultural or institutional flexibility and willingness to respond to different scientific information (e.g.,&#160;Hart and Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012, 2013).&#8226; The technical capability and expertise of the different actors, including users, producers, and communicators (e.g.,&#160;Sarewitz, 2004; Gorddard et&#160;al., 2016).&#8226; Potential contrasts in value systems such as the different views of the Global North compared to those of economies in transition or under development (Henrich et&#160;al., 2010a, b; Sapiains et&#160;al.,&#160;2021).&#8226; The relative importance of climate change in relation to non-climate stressors on the temporal and spatial scales of interest to the user, which at times are not the ones initially assumed by the producers (Otto et&#160;al., 2015).&#8226; Availability, timing and accessibility of the required climate information, including the availability of sources such as observations, model simulations, literature and experts of the relevant regional climate (Mulwa et&#160;al., 2017). In developing countries, the availability of all or some of these sources may be limited (Dinku et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="258.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="258.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">These and other contextual elements can frame subsequent decisions about the construction of regional climate information for applications. For example, an engineer typically seeks quantitative information, while the policy community may be more responsive to storylines and how information is positioned within a&#160;causal network describing regional climate risk (Section&#160;1.4.4 and Box&#160;10.2). Multiple contexts can coexist and potentially result in competing approaches (for example, when urban governance contends with regional water-resource management in the same area).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="526.72" top="138.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="138.48" x1="526.72" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 138.48; y1: 148.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.2.2 Developing Climate Information Conditioned by&#160;Values of Different Actors and Communities</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="102.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="102.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Developing climate information relevant to user needs can be influenced by the explicit and implicit values of all parties: those constructing the information, those communicating the information, those receiving the information, and, critically, those who construct the problem statement being addressed.
