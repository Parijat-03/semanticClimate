However, as evident from studies found in this review, addressing these vulnerabilities also requires an understanding of norms, values, and socio-economic conditions (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, such studies require a focus on power relationships between civil society actors, governments, and industry actors (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora, 2019</xref>). This is a strong argument for a pluralistic understandings and multiple pathways towards sustainability (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora, 2019</xref>). Although there have been many suggestions for transformation typologies, some stand out as innovative through this review. One such typology draws on &#8220;transformative engagement&#8221;<italic>,</italic> mostly known from the work of <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Stirling (2019)</xref>, who, in a rejection of modernist approaches, seeks to level epistemological and cultural hierarchies. Transformative engagement rejects aspirations of control and applies more &#8220;caring practices&#8221; as key in such processes (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Stirling, 2018</xref>). Caring practices signify a more holistic approach that may undo those practices that further asymmetrical power relations. Overall transformational engagement to caring practices entails what <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora (2019)</xref> argues are systems where knowledge or life is reduced or veiled, and &#8220;might enable practices to collectively become caring of vulnerable and neglected social and ecological worlds&#8221; (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora, 2019</xref>:1575).</p>
