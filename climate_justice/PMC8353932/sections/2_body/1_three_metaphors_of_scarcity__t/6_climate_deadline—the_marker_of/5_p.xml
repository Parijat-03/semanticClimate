The widespread use of the 2030 deadline is also evidenced by the fact that prominent public figures, such as US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> and former US State Secretary John Kerry,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> made use of this rhetoric too. The 2030 deadline thus serves as a &#8216;marker of urgency&#8217; signifying the need for radical mitigation in the present before it becomes &#8216;too late&#8217; to stop dangerous climate change.</p>
