If the ceiling is very high then it would only affect the most extreme emitters, largely making capability ceilings irrelevant. It is challenging to pinpoint exactly where to put the ceiling in terms of HDI, a difficulty that is also relevant to other instructive theories such as pinpointing where the difference between subsistence and luxury emissions is (Shue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]), and how to establish a &#8216;fair quota&#8217; of emissions (Caney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). But given that a redistribution of energy consumption per capita would increase HDI for the least well-off, that seems like a justified choice. CA supplemented with ceilings would provide room for energy use for the least well-off, currently most likely in the form of fossil fuels but also of off-grid renewables. But it would also restrict the energy use of high-emitters as a matter of justice.</p>
