<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Criticism in the <italic toggle="yes">critical comments</italic> sub-theme was being mainly
directed toward the models with a few other instances of it being directed at
entities and actors. Comments criticized the models for their poor performance
due to the lack of testing data incorporated into the models (e.g. &#8220;Garbage in,
garbage out. Until we test enough, we&#8217;re just guessing.&#8221;) or the bias they may
introduce among researchers aiming to understand how the virus is spreading
(e.g. &#8220;These models limit a researcher&#8217;s ability to see how the data develops.
they channel the researcher into seeing if the data fits the model instead of if
the data fits the theory. I know this sounds abstract but it is a genuine
worry&#8221;). The over-optimism in some models&#8217; predictions was also criticized by
commenters as shown in this comment:<disp-quote><p>I looked back at IHME forecast in March. It predicted 1,500 deaths in CA
by end of August. We passed 2000 in April. Even now it predicts we will
be done with deaths by May 19 or so. The model is far too
optimistic.</p></disp-quote></p>
