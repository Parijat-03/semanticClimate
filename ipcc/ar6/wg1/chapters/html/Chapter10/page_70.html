Understanding the context, however, is not trivial and requires understanding of both the user and provider (Guido et&#160;al., 2020) if the information is to be robust, reliable and relevant (Giorgi, 2020). Translating the information into context requires consideration of terminology and expectations (Briley et&#160;al., 2015), issues of user interpretation (Daron et&#160;al., 2015), and hence necessitating engagement in co-production with all attendant challenges (Vincent et&#160;al., 2021). The actual provision of climate information may be conducted at different levels of sophistication, ranging from generic data provision via web portals (Hewitson et&#160;al., 2017), potentially including impact-relevant climate indicators, region-specific factsheets and stakeholder reports, social media (Pearce et&#160;al., 2019), to a&#160;close engagement with specific stakeholders in co-exploring the research (Steynor et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="90.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="90.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.84; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate information products may often lack explanations of their potential use and misuse (Street, 2016; Lamb, 2017; Chimani et&#160;al., 2020).

Traditional top-down approaches frame the research from the perspective of global climate change as a&#160;driver of regional climate risk. Bottom-up approaches, also referred to as scenario-neutral impact studies (Prudhomme et&#160;al., 2010; A. Brown et&#160;al., 2012; C. Brown et&#160;al., 2012; Culley et&#160;al., 2016) begin with the user&#8217;s articulation of vulnerability in the context of climatic and non-climatic stressors, follow with the definition of key system thresholds of climatic variables, and only incorporate climate data to assess the likelihood of threshold exceedances. Bottom-up approaches are special cases of robust decision-making (Lempert et&#160;al., 2006; Lempert and Collins, 2007; Walker et&#160;al., 2013; Weaver et&#160;al., 2013), which are designed to account for uncertainties not represented by climate models as well as non-climatic stressors. Interactive approaches combine aspects of top-down and bottom-up approaches. The choice of approach depends on the context. While bottom-up approaches might be optimal in a&#160;local context, where case-specific risks are addressed, top-down approaches provide generic information that may serve a&#160;range of different purposes, for example, at the national scale (Berkhout et&#160;al., 2013). All these approaches benefit from the integration of fully distilled climate information (Berkhout et&#160;al., 2013; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="534.27" top="330.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="330.48" x1="534.27" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 330.48; y1: 340.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.3.4 Barriers to the Distillation of Climate Information</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="306.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="306.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As implied by Section&#160;10.5.2, meeting the needs of users can be a&#160;substantial challenge for climate scientists if they misunderstand or have limited understanding of user needs and context (Porter and Dessai, 2017). Several barriers in user communities can trigger and&#160;sustain this challenge. This can include an institutional aversion to incorporating new tools into decision-making (Callahan et&#160;al., 1999). Coincident with this factor, there may be limited staff capacity, lack of management support and lack of a&#160;mandate to plan for climate change (Lee and Whitely Binder, 2010).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="186.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="186.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.31; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Following from those challenges, constructing and communicating regional climate information often occurs under the overarching assumption that uncertainty is a&#160;problem and reducing uncertainty is the priority (Eisenack et&#160;al., 2014; J. Otto et&#160;al., 2016). This is both a&#160;psychological (Morton et&#160;al., 2011) as well as a&#160;pragmatic barrier in cases where uncertainty appears to limit the ability to make decisions (Mukheibir and Ziervogel, 2007). However, where in-depth engagements with decision contexts are undertaken, these initial barriers are often dismantled to reveal a&#160;more complex, nuanced and potentially more productive intersection with climate information producers that can efficiently handle uncertainty (e.g.,&#160;Rice et&#160;al., 2009; Lemos et&#160;al., 2012; Moss, 2016). Specifically, disclosure of all uncertainties in the climate </span></div></body></html>
