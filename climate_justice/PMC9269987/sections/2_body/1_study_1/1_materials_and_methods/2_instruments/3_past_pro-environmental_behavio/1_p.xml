<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To measure the first dependent variable, 10 pro-environmental behaviors were queried for the last year (i.e., 2019 as the survey was conducted in 2020). Due to the pandemic state of emergency during the survey period, we did not ask about the current behavior as this may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we measured past pro-environmental behavior in Study 1. The participants were asked to indicate whether they pursued the specified behavior (&#8220;yes,&#8221; &#8220;no,&#8221; or &#8220;do not know&#8221;). To prevent an acquiescence bias (the tendency to answer with &#8220;yes&#8221; regardless of the question), some items were framed pro-environmentally and others from an environmentally damaging perspective. An example of an item is &#8220;In 2019, I purchased green electricity.&#8221; Based on the idea of the Campbell Paradigm (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2013</xref>), we addressed behaviors of varying &#8220;difficulty.&#8221; For example, we expected it to be more difficult to use green electricity (because it is more expensive) than to lower the washing temperature. The inverted items were subsequently reversed, and the relative frequency of pro-environmental behavior was computed for each person. The internal consistency of the scale was Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; = 0.41. As the measure can be regarded as a formative measure (the latent construct is formed by the items) instead of a reflective measure (the latent construct is causal for the item responses), internal consistency estimates for reliability coefficients should not be interpreted and not considered for item selection (e.g., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Bollen and Lennox, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Rossiter, 2002</xref>).
