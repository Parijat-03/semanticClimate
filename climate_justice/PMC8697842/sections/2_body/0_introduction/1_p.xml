However, as I&#351;&#305;k et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>) stated, energy consumption is a critical aspect in achieving strong economic growth. In this context, the keyfactor is the type of energy that is used. Since the industrial revolution, the global economy has been using fossil fuels as an energy source due to their abundance and relative cost-effectiveness. However, these widely-used fossil fuels have also brought certain problems. As Marques et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>) highlighted in their study, the extensive use of fossil fuels raised the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions substantially. According to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around the world increased from 20.5 gigatons (GT) to 32.8 GT over the period 1990&#8211;2017. Accordingly, the per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions rose from 3.4 to 4.4 tons in the same period (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). It is widely accepted that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and specifically carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions are the main cause of climate change and global warming. The carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions account for the largest proportion of GHG emissions.</p>
