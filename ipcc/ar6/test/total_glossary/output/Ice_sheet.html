The margins usually slope more steeply, and most ice is <em>discharged</em> through fast-flowing ice streams or outlet <em><a href="#glacier">glaciers</a></em>, often into the sea or into <em>ice shelves</em> floating on the sea. There are only two ice sheets in the modern world, one on Greenland and one on Antarctica. The latter is divided into the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet. During glacial periods, there were other ice sheets.</p></div></dd><div>
