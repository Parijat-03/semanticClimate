Then there are countries (Algeria and Turkey) that can have a future budget similar to the one emitted in the historical period considered. And finally, there are countries (Albania, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia) able to have a future emissions budget that can exceed the historical by more than 30%.</p>
