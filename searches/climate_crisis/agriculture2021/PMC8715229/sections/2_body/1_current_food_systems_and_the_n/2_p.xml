<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0130">There are a great variety of food systems. When speaking of the global food system here, this is done to describe general overarching trends. Global trends are shaped by the interactions between various food systems at local to global scales, including synergies, complementarities, and the competition among them. The High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) on food security and nutrition of the World Committee on Food Security provides a categorization of food systems. Food systems cover all the components needed from producing to consuming foods as well as the management of waste and by-products and typologies include modern, mixed, and traditional food systems (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">HLPE, 2017</xref>).</p>
