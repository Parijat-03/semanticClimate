We can only wonder what the psychological fallout will be from the &#8220;loss of home&#8221; writ large in the coming era of climate migration. How will pastoral and spiritual care providers, clinical practitioners, clergy, and faith communities keep up with the increasing demand for social, spiritual, and psychological support from the many who will be displaced from &#8220;home?&#8221; This is something for us to be thinking about <italic>now</italic>, while there is still time, lest we find ourselves experiencing burnout from the increasing demands for care. Some of us, particularly first responders, have already been feeling some degree of burnout and overwhelm as we continue working through the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hard to imagine the exponential demand for care and support that will come with unprecedented climate migration, of global proportion. If we as care providers have learned anything at all from the pandemic, it is the importance of finding care and support for ourselves <italic>before</italic> we reach the point of burnout, depression, and/or depletion.</p>
