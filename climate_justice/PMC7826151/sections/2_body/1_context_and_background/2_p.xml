At the core of the case studies were interviews with over 40 museum professionals from Brazil, Canada, Italy, Finland, U.S.A., and Zimbabwe, including directors, CEOs, curators, coordinators, educators, and facilitators. Additionally, while on site, we observed and interviewed hundreds of visitors engaged with these exhibitions. Alongside interviewing different museum communities, professionals, and visiting publics, we gathered documents and artefacts about displays and programs; took images and field notes; and collected exit comment cards and accounts written by audiences while attending the science museum. Empirical data and findings from these multiple case studies have been published elsewhere (see, for example, Navas Iannini &amp; Pedretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>; Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>; Pedretti, Navas Iannini &amp; Atkinson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>; Pedretti, Navas Iannini &amp; Nazir, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>) and have informed our theorizing in this work.</p>
