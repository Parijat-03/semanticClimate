An adaptive management approach involves real-time monitoring and evaluation, learning among stakeholders, innovating and re-strategizing whenever necessary. A particular feature of climate risks is that the situation is increasingly dynamic as temperatures are rising and impacts accelerating. The adaptation needs of small-scale producers are constantly evolving which is why the focus on general resilience building to shocks and variations is key. Adaptive management is important for managing uncertainty on the basis of best-available information, and to avoid maladaptation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This requires a financing structure that allows for some flexibility to adapt based on monitoring and assessment.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The process of adaptive management</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12571_2021_1210_Fig5_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p>
