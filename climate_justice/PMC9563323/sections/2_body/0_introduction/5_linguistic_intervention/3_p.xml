<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The way we frame complex environmental issues is especially critical, according to <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_038" ref-type="bibr">Lakoff (2010)</xref>. &#8220;Facts&#8221;, he argues, &#8220;must make sense in terms of their system of frames, or they will be ignored [&#8230;] to understand something complex, a person must have a system of frames in place that can make sense of the facts&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_038" ref-type="bibr">Lakoff 2010</xref>: 73). We understand &#8220;facts&#8221; here to refer to any kind of information that is conveyed in the interest of public science communication. If we are to help laypersons, i.e. most members of the public, to properly understand the complex nature of plastic and its correct use and disposal, linguistic reframing strategies must be deployed with a sensitivity to the stories and frames that already exist in the minds of many people.</p>
