<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0002">In addition to COVID-19, the global HIV/AIDS epidemic also persists against the backdrop of another global crisis - climate change. The climate emergency is anticipated to generate dire health consequences worldwide in the coming years and decades. While the pathways that link climate change and different disease areas are better understood, the connection between climate change and HIV/AIDS is still yet to be recognized both in research and practice. Over the past decade, there have been a few attempts to describe the linkages between climate change and HIV/AIDS <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03155-y" id="interref0001">[</ext-link>

Overall, the pathways linking the two are more indirect, as there is neither plausible explanation nor evidence of climate change's direct influence on the virus itself, unlike its impacts on the behavior of pathogen-bearing mosquitoes for instance <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, the previously described frameworks either presented more generic pathways, such as how extreme weather events can lead to forced displacement of populations which can hamper access to HIV/AIDS treatment, or described only a select number of linkages and missed other important ones <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
