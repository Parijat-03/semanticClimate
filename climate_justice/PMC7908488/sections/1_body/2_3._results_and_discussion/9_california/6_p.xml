<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Reasons for greater thermal inequities in California likely concern vegetation and geography. While irrigated green space is not uncommon in Las Vegas and Phoenix, high-income California neighborhoods typically have more vegetation than their counterparts in other Southwestern urban regions. A history of state- and federally funded water projects in California have made cheap water available to many residential developments. Additionally, California&#8217;s physical environment appears to play a role in that higher-income neighborhoods are often located close to parks, water bodies, natural green space, or irrigated farmland. Urban regions such as Bakersfield and Fresno surround extensive irrigated agriculture. For urban regions such as San Jose and Palm Springs, nearby mountains may ameliorate temperatures within high-income neighborhoods. Wealthy neighborhoods in Sacramento may be disproportionately cooled by the American and Sacramento river greenways. In Los Angeles and San Diego, higher-income neighborhoods are near the Pacific Ocean. Further research will be necessary to more precisely identify the role of such features in creating greater thermal inequities within California&#8217;s urban areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
