Water insecurities in Asia are increasing due to excessive freshwater withdrawals (Satoh et&#160;al., 2017), economic and population growth (Gleick and Iceland, 2018), urbanisation and peri-urbanisation (Roth et&#160;al., 2019), food insecurity (Demin, 2014) and lack of access to clean and safe drinking water (Cullet, 2016), which mostly affects the health of the most vulnerable members of society.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="294.62"><span x0="306.57" y0="294.62" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 294.62; y1: 304.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Significantly, climate change will add to already existing vulnerabilities. In the case of the Yellow River basin in China, underlining the interface between future water scarcity and hydroclimatic and anthropogenic drivers, a recent study expects moderate-to-severe water scarcity over six Yellow River sub-catchments under the RCP4.5 scenario, and anticipates that human influences on water scarcity will be worse than that of climate change, with water availability in the downstream being impacted by concurrent changes in land use and high temperature (Omer et&#160;al., 2020). Nearly 8% of internationally shared or transboundary aquifers (TBAs), ensuring livelihood security for millions of people through sustaining drinking water supply and food production, are currently overstressed due to human overexploitation (Wada and Heinrich, 2013). The Asia Pacific region has the highest annual water withdrawal due to its geographic size, growing population and irrigation practices, and water for agriculture continues to consume 80% of the region&#8217;s resources (Taniguchi et&#160;al., 2017b; Visvanathan, 2018).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="90.64"><span x0="306.57" y0="90.64" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 90.64; y1: 100.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In South Asia, surface water and groundwater resources are already under stress (both in terms of quality and quantity) due to population growth, economic development, poor governance and management, and poor efficiency of use in economic production.
