This has the advantage of providing certainty to the market and incentives to developers of alternatives and for shipping lines to become the first movers. Nevertheless, the political challenges of such a regulation may be insurmountable, at least at the international level. Therefore, the second aspect is a governance change to move responsibility for maritime emissions back to the national level where at least some countries may then apply such direct regulation. Yet many countries, even so-called environmental leaders, only envisage a transition to alternative fuels and to continue and even grow current levels of shipping. The likelihood of being able to produce sufficient green fuels is in fact highly improbable. Producing sufficient green electricity to cover existing domestic power needs, in addition to electric cars and other future uses, is already a historic challenge (ETC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). Producing additional green electricity in order to produce the green hydrogen and ammonia needed to fuel the shipping sector may not be possible in any realistic timescale. Even if this were possible, it does not begin to address related issues such as resource depletion and water pollution. Thus, the third solution is to evaluate the potential of alternative economic approaches such as degrowth (Monios &amp; Wilmsmeier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>). The work of both Felli and Sandel aids us in understanding why such alternatives are rendered invisible by the dominance of market-based thinking.</p>
