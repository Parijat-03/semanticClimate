These improvements in climate modelling have advanced 2 understanding of climate variability in South America; however, significant biases persist mainly at regional 3 scales (Bl&#225;zquez and Nu&#241;ez, 2013; Gulizia et al., 2013; Joetzjer et al., 2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; 4 Torres and Marengo, 2013a; Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; Zazulie et al., 2017; Abadi et al., 2018; Barros 5 and Doyle, 2018). The biases in seasonal precipitation, annual precipitation and climate extremes over 6 several regions of South America were reduced, including the Amazon, central South America, Bolivia, 7 eastern Argentina and Uruguay, in the CMIP5 models when compared to those of CMIP3 (</span><span style="x0: 457.8; x1: 465.72; y0: 684.23; y1: 695.21; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="457.8" y0="684.23" x1="495.34">medium </span><span x0="33.18" y0="684.23" x1="41.44" style="x0: 33.18; x1: 38.66; y0: 684.23; y1: 695.21; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">8 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 61.57; y0: 671.57; y1: 682.55; width: 4.87; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="671.57" x1="104.34">confidence</span><span x0="104.34" y0="671.57" x1="41.44" style="x0: 104.34; x1: 107.99; y0: 671.57; y1: 682.55; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">) (D&#237;az and Vera, 2017). In general, the multi-model ensemble results have demonstrated better 9 performance compared to individual models in most seasons and regions (Sillmann et al., 2013b; Torres and 10 Marengo, 2013a; Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015). The representation of the South America Monsoon System 11 (SAMS) life cycle exhibited a significant improvement in some CMIP5 models when compared to their 12 versions in the CMIP3 whereas others continue to have problems in representing accurately the main SAMS 13 features, such as amplitude and length (Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Reboita et al., 2014; de Carvalho and 14 Cavalcanti, 2016). 15 16 RCM simulations showed a systematic temperature underestimation over the Amazon, temperature 17 overestimation and precipitation underestimation over La Plata Basin, with the warm bias amplified for 18 austral summer and the dry bias amplified for the rainy season (Solman et al., 2013; Reboita et al., 2014; 19 Solman, 2016a). The dry bias shown by most RCMs in the La Plata Basin is partially due to errors in 20 representing cold-front passages over southern Brazil (de Jesus et al., 2016). In summer the precipitation bias 21 is explained by too few passages of cold fronts, while in winter it is explained by the fact that low pressure 22 systems are not deep enough and that there is a lack of moisture availability in low levels.  23 24 The evaluation of statistical downscaling models (ESD) in representing the different regional climate 25 features in South America has increased since the AR5 assessment, however there are still few ESD studies 26 over the different subregions. Precipitation simulations based on ESD models properly reproduce mean 27 precipitation over tropical and subtropical South American regions, especially with maximum precipitation 28 areas in western Colombia, south-eastern Peru, central Bolivia and the La Plata basin (Souvignet et al., 2010; 29 Mendes et al., 2014; Palomino-Lemus et al., 2015, 2017, 2018; Soares dos Santos et al., 2016; Troin et al., 30 2016; Bettolli and Penalba, 2018; Bettolli et al., submitted). Major discrepancies are linked with dry areas or 31 with unreliable coverage of data. Temperature simulations are fewer but satisfactory over the La Plata Basin 32 plains as well as the complex orography of north central Chile (Souvignet et al., 2010; Bettolli and Penalba, 33 2018). 34 35 Overall, climate modelling has made some progress in the past decades, but the results reveal that there is no 36 model that performs well in simulating all aspects of the present climate over South America. The 37 performance of the models varies according to the region, time scale, and variables analysed (Abadi et al., 38 2018). There is also a fairly narrow spread in the representation of temperature and precipitation over South 39 America by the CMIP5 GCMs and also the RCMs, with biases that can be associated with the 40 parametrizations and schemes of surface, boundary layer, microphysics and radiation used by the models. 41 Finally, observational reference datasets, such as reanalysis products, used in the calibration and validation 42 of climate models also can be quite uncertain and may explain part of the important biases present in climate 43 models.  44 45 46 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 190.85; y1: 201.83; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="190.85" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.5.2.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="190.85" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 190.85; y1: 201.83; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">47 Previous assessments, as was shown in AR5 WGI Chapter 12, AR5 WGII Chapter 27 and SR1.5 Chapter 3, 48 based on the CMIP5 multi-model projections, have suggested that substantial warming (2&#176;C to 6&#176;C) would 49 occur in a large portion of South America at the end of 21st century for all emission scenarios (RCPs) (</span><span style="x0: 510.85; x1: 516.33; y0: 151.97; y1: 162.95; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="510.85" y0="151.97" x1="533.21">high </span><span x0="27.66" y0="151.97" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 151.97; y1: 162.95; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">50 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 61.58; y0: 139.37; y1: 150.35; width: 4.87; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="139.37" x1="104.35">confidence</span><span x0="104.34" y0="139.37" x1="41.45" style="x0: 104.34; x1: 108.0; y0: 139.37; y1: 150.35; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">).
