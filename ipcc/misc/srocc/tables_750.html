      <td>New policies and initiatives during the past decade or so have increased support for bioenergy as a non-intermittent (stored) renewable\nwith wide geographic availability that is cost-effective in a range of applications. Significant upscaling of bioenergy requires dedicated\n(normally land-based) sources in addition to use of wastes and residues. As a result, a disadvantageous high land-use intensity compared\nto other renewables (Fritsche et al. 2017) that, in turn, place greater demands on governance. Bioenergy, especially traditional fuels,\ncurrently provides the largest share of renewable energy globally and has a significant role in nearly all climate stabilisation scenarios,\nalthough estimates of its potential vary widely (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). Policies and governance for bioenergy systems\nand markets must address diverse applications and sectors across levels from local to global; here we briefly review the literature in\nrelation to governance for modern bioenergy and biofuels with respect to land and climate impacts, whereas traditional biomass use\n(see Glossary) (&gt; 50% of energy used today with greater land use and GHG emissions impacts in low- and medium-income countries\n(Bailis et al. 2015; Masera et al. 2015; Bailis et al. 2017a; Kiruki et al. 2017b)) is addressed elsewhere (Sections 4.5.4 and 7.4.6.4 and\nCross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7). The bioenergy lifecycle is relevant in accounting for &#8211; and attributing &#8211; land impacts and GHG\nemissions (Section 2.5.1.5). Integrated responses across different sectors can help to reduce negative impacts and promote sustainable\ndevelopment opportunities (Table 6.9, Table 6.58, Chapter 6).</td>
