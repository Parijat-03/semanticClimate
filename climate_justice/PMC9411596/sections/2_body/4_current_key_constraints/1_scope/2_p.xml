Such an assessment might, for example, consider the risk of drought to food production in a set of regions, or flood risks to datacentres worldwide. Albeit useful, this approach will miss compounding and systemic risks due to its limited scope. In the examples above, it would miss the risk to the agri-food industry from the combination of climate extremes with energy and geopolitical crises; and it would miss the risk for datacentre owners from climate policy changes in one region that could increase the cost of importing components from another, for example, the&#160;EU&#8217;s carbon border adjustment tax.</p>
