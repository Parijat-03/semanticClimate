The fragile sectors were identified through several consultations with various government departments (as part of the larger exercise of developing and revising the SAPCC for Delhi) and the assessment was undertaken using available validated information and data, along with a few stakeholder consultations. The following steps were followed to perform this vulnerability assessment: </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.11" top="649.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="649.23" x1="526.11" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Six sectors that are currently fragile and expected to be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change were identified for the state of Delhi, including: (a) Health, (b)Energy, (c)Water Resources, (d)Urban Planning (infrastructure, waste management and land use), (e)Transport, and (f)Agriculture, Forest &amp; Biodiversity. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.2" top="506.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="506.28" x1="526.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 506.28; y1: 518.28; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of each fragile sector to the various impacts of climate change were analyzed. Exposure generally relates to the sector/urban system as whole, while sensitivity relates to social groups and specific areas within the sector/urban system in question. These were analyzed with the help of available published literature, in the form of published articles in scientific journals and reports published by the Government of India and Delhi.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.06" top="395.26"><span x0="72.02" y0="395.26" x1="526.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 395.26; y1: 407.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Adaptive capacity is the available capacity of a given population/area/system to adapt to the projected impacts of climate change. This can be in the form of social, human, physical, natural and financial capital. These also included the policies and other institutional mechanisms in place to combat the impacts of climate change. This was also undertaken with the help of a secondary literature review. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.44" top="303.94"><span x0="72.02" y0="303.94" x1="526.44" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 303.94; y1: 315.94; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The vulnerability of the sectors to projected climate impacts has been defined as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with separate sections for each. These are then synthesized at the end, leading to the adaptation strategies (infrastructure and institutional) that complement the existing adaptive capacity to combat the impacts of climate change. Here various climate change action plans were studied to identify the relevant adaptation actions for the sectors in question in Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="334.39" top="190.39"><span x0="72.02" y0="190.39" x1="334.39" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 190.39; y1: 202.39; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2Vulnerability Assessment of Fragile Sectors </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.24" top="162.79"><span x0="72.02" y0="162.79" x1="526.24" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 162.79; y1: 174.79; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The vulnerability of the sectors to projected climate impacts has been defined as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with separate sections for each.
