<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">Computational modelling can play an influential role in research and high-level policymaking on the diffusion of technological and social innovation and understanding interactions between key characteristics of consumers&#8217; behaviour affecting investment decisions. For example, there are integrated assessment models <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref> that explicitly simulate the decision-making processes of heterogeneous decision makers (with different objectives, search strategies, and decision methods) in the energy system <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Such models, combining top-down approaches with agent-based modelling, allow the integration of several decision-making steps towards capturing a realistic representation of energy markets in transition, including information gathering, performance assessment and alternative option selection <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>.</p>
