Typical examples of adaptation measures include flood protection, awareness and information campaigns, heat warning systems, and disease surveillance and monitoring [<xref rid="B23-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The effects of individual measures have not yet been conclusively proven [<xref rid="B24-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however, and potentially adverse outcomes generated by adaptation are still under-researched [<xref rid="B26-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
