<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Forty-two stadia were found to have involved a partnership with or received funding from a major grocery/retail chain as a part of the redevelopment of the site. This funding supported the relocation of the team, the construction of the new site, or both. Most redevelopment plans anchored by grocery chains have been concentrated primarily in the United Kingdom. One way to incorporate elements of circularity into a grocery/retail redevelopment site is to repurpose the original building or arena, rather than demolishing it. However, this requires the original building to be intact so that it can be efficiently refurbished. For future sport stadia construction projects, new facilities should be designed and built with the consideration of refurbishment, so that decades later a circular approach can be employed.</p>
