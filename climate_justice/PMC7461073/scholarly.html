While this fall in emissions has happened for all the wrong reasons, countries are now deploying the rhetoric of a ‘green recovery’. How widely do you think this idea is shared, particularly in the Global South, and how should the international community work together to support these economies in their recovery?</b></p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> I think that very few governments reject the rhetoric of a green recovery; the problem, as always, is whether or not their rhetoric translates into meaningful action. Even in the Global North, where governments have much greater financial resources at their disposal, despite a lot of talk about the need for a green recovery, billions have been poured into propping up carbon intensive sectors like aviation<a href="#newe12203-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> without any strings attached.</p> <p>When talking about the Global South, the first thing to remember is that a lot of countries are still in the depths of a health and economic crisis and that one of the big barriers to addressing the immediate healthcare needs of their populations – let alone planning for a green recovery – is the huge debt burdens that a lot of those countries are dealing with. It's very difficult to see how lower income countries can plan for any kind of economic recovery when they're due to spend US$40 billion on debt payments just this year,<a href="#newe12203-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> including payments to multilateral bodies like the IMF [International Monetary Fund] as well as private lenders.</p> <p>Thanks to calls from social movements and organisations around the world, there's been some cancellation or suspension of debt repayments by Global South countries, but it's a tiny fraction of the relief that's needed. Not only does there need to be much greater debt cancellation (keep in mind that a lot of this debt is illegitimate or so‐called ‘odious’ debt<a href="#newe12203-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> and the result of external factors like increases in the cost of borrowing), but the international community needs to create a permanent solution to debt crises<a href="#newe12203-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a> by properly regulating private lenders and establishing a debt workout mechanism housed by the UN [United Nations]. As long as countries in the Global South are diverting their significant chunks of their finances towards debt repayment, it's hard to see how they can reorient their economies to deal with the climate crisis.</p> <p><b>Mary:</b> Whilst greenhouse gas emissions may have dipped, as leaders begin to open their economies again we can see emissions rebounding across the world, with air pollution levels increasing in major cities too. Through the pandemic we have seen a desire for change – for example fewer people want Britain to return to ‘normal’<a href="#newe12203-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a> after lockdown is lifted, with many having noticed cleaner air, fewer cars and more wildlife.</p> <p>Through the Paris Agreement, each country provides a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] – a plan that outlines their actions to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis. While Tessa is absolutely right about the huge health and debt burdens facing countries in the Global South as the pandemic affects countries in unequal ways, some countries in the Global South are coming forward with stronger plans for mitigation as well as adaptation in their NDCs. In spite of the economic damage from coronavirus – as global public health measures, value chains, tourism and remittances are disrupted and debt burdens grow – some countries are increasing the number of activities that they will fund to combat climate change. The revised ambitious NDC from Rwanda is a prime example of that.</p> <p><b>IPPR: On the international stage, what opportunities to tackle the climate and ecological crisis do you see arising from the response to Covid‐19 and what are the risks we must avoid?</b></p> <p><b>Mary:</b> We have seen the postponement of the pivotal COP26 climate summit, and the derailment of so many other linchpin events in 2020. These adjournments cannot be reflected in a delay on climate action. In our recovery from Covid‐19 we must vehemently oppose any attempts to lock in high carbon and unsustainable development through recovery packages. For example, we are already seeing some nations renewing investments in coal – coal cannot be a clean source of energy. It is imperative that the recovery from Covid‐19 is completely aligned with addressing the urgency of the climate crisis and moves firmly away from any reliance on fossil fuels. Now is the time for investment in clean, renewable technologies.</p> <p>The challenges facing the world might seem unsurmountable, but though the pandemic has caused disruption in all walks of life I remain an optimist – I believe there are lessons on global cooperation we can draw from the pandemic. While Covid‐19 has demonstrated the dangers of sidelining the science, it has also provided us with examples of what can be achieved when we work together. The only sustainable solutions to both the coronavirus pandemic and to the pressing global climate crisis are ones where the world works together.</p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> As Mary says, there are opportunities. One of the biggest opportunities stems from the current, unprecedented financial vulnerability of the fossil fuel industry, which is connected to the crash in the price of commodities like oil as demand has dried up. Those industries are now coming to governments cap in hand, and it's an opportunity for governments to finally reconcile their longstanding rhetoric on addressing climate change with their ongoing support for the fossil fuel industry, which amounts to at least tens of billions of dollars a year in subsidies and public finance among G20 countries alone.<a href="#newe12203-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a></p> <p>Fossil fuels and the fossil fuel industry have so far escaped scrutiny in the context of international climate talks and other multilateral fora where climate has been on the agenda. This is despite a huge gap<a href="#newe12203-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a> between the amount of fossil fuels that we know can be burned if we're going to stay below 1.5°C or even 2°C of warming, and the planned production of fossil fuels in the next decade. In fact, the words ‘fossil fuels’ don't even appear in the Paris Agreement. It's long past time to change that. The managed decline of the fossil fuel industry needs to be part of every multilateral discussion from now on. Governments not only need to ensure that production is phased out at a rate that is commensurate with addressing the climate crisis; they also need to ensure a just transition for workers and communities who will be affected by the decline of those industries. There will be no climate justice unless we can do both of those things.</p> <p><b>IPPR: What more needs to be done to embed the concept of ‘climate justice’ within international diplomacy and governance arrangements?</b></p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> International diplomacy routinely squeezes out calls for climate justice because processes like the UN climate talks are simply more accessible if you're a rich country or constituency or interest group. The complexity of the climate talks, which have dozens of different workstreams that are often being negotiated simultaneously, means that those countries that can afford to send large diplomatic contingents for weeks at a time are more likely to be able to influence the outcomes of those negotiations. Further, civil society groups and movements calling for climate justice – which are overwhelmingly from the Global South – are stopped from effectively voicing their demands in the talks because of the literal and metaphorical cost of entry to the negotiations, including travel costs, the registration process and crackdowns on peaceful protest.<a href="#newe12203-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a></p> <p><b>Mary:</b> Climate change hits hardest the people who did the least to create the problem. Climate change, human rights, justice and equality are all inextricably linked – and must be at the heart of international diplomacy and governance arrangements. This means greater transparency, greater inclusion and greater action – not just words. At COP25, the chasm between the demands of young people, of scientists, of women, of vulnerable states, of indigenous peoples, of defenders of the environment and the pace and outcomes of the negotiations never felt wider. Diplomacy, led by the incoming COP26 presidency, needs to address this to convince the world of a positive outcome from the meetings next year.</p> <p>As Tessa explains, this partly relates to the way the negotiations are carried out. I was pleased to hear the UK COP presidency say in February 2020 this will be the most transparent and inclusive COP. This must be maintained in light of Covid‐19.</p> <p>The compositions of delegations at the COP are not equal – only 10 countries had a 50:50 gender balanced delegation at COP25.<a href="#newe12203-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a> Only 27 per cent of countries had a woman<a href="#newe12203-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a> as the head of delegation that same year. As Tessa outlined, negotiators from the Global South are disadvantaged by sometimes having to be in two places at once during the COPs. Programmes like the European Capacity Building Initiative (ECBI), which supports junior climate negotiators from least developed countries to develop their skills and become specialist negotiators, can help address this imbalance. Without proper participation and access there cannot be meaningful discussions on embedding climate justice.</p> <p><b>IPPR: What impact have recent events – both the Covid‐19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement – had on the way we think about climate justice?</b></p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> The Black Lives Matter movement has helped to force a long overdue reckoning on race and racial justice within the climate movement in the Global North. In addition to coming to terms with the overall whiteness of the movement, it's forcing a lot of groups that work on climate change to ask hard questions about whether or not their demands are actually ambitious enough to deliver climate justice. Are the kinds of changes they're asking for, like net zero emissions for rich countries in 30 years, really enough to protect black lives and white lives equally? Or does it involve sacrificing black and brown communities in the Global South who have done almost nothing to contribute to the climate crisis?</p> <p>The BLM movement also shone a light on the deep structural inequalities within rich countries like the US and UK and has well and truly debunked the idea that we live in a ‘post‐racial’ society. The disproportionate impact of Covid‐19 on communities of colour in the UK has also made it clear how those inequalities are magnified in a crisis. We can't build the mass climate movement that we know is necessary to force real political change unless we accept that there will be no climate justice without racial justice.</p> <p><b>Mary:</b> While Covid‐19 has affected the whole world, it has not affected the whole world equally. As with the climate crisis, in the majority of cases it is the most vulnerable people in our world who have been affected the most by the pandemic. Crises are often compounded by other economic and political challenges. Covid‐19 has intensified prevailing inequalities, but it has also shown us it is possible for human behaviour to change.</p> <p>Recent events – both Covid‐19 and the conversations that have been long overdue emerging out of the Black Lives Matter movement – raise the need for leaders to be more inclusive in every aspect of the response to climate change. We must listen to underrepresented voices across all racial groups. We also need to listen to the young people, to climate vulnerable states, to indigenous peoples, to women, to the scientists, to environmental defenders, and we need to ensure the global community is supportive of their needs, including action on the provision of climate finance.</p> <p>We must not return to ‘business as usual’ in our Covid‐19 recovery. We must ensure that climate‐positive, justice‐centred policies and investments are at the heart of building back better. My podcast, <i>Mothers of Invention</i>, launched a project called Climate RE‐FRAME<a href="#newe12203-note-0011"><sup>11</sup></a> earlier this year, highlighting 100 experts and community activists from across the Black, Asian and other ethnic minority communities in the UK who are leading in addressing the climate crisis. We need their voices and perspectives in the media, at climate conferences and in working groups – at the moment that representation is sorely lacking.</p> <p><b>IPPR: The Paris Agreement felt like a very positive step towards tackling the climate crisis but also a success for international governance and cooperation. Since then, we have seen some of that cooperation be eroded. What action should the UK be taking to revitalise international climate diplomacy and cooperation, particularly in the build‐up to COP26?</b></p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> There are several things the UK government needs to do. The first thing is to get its own house in order – it's hard to see how it can be a credible leader in climate diplomacy without that. We know that the UK government is way off track<a href="#newe12203-note-0012"><sup>12</sup></a> to meet its own climate goals, and that even those goals likely fall far short<a href="#newe12203-note-0013"><sup>13</sup></a> of what is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and certainly what many calling for climate justice would consider fair. The UK also needs to start accounting for emissions that may fall outside of the formal Paris accounting framework – like emissions embedded in imports and associated with international aviation and shipping – but which in reality drive climate change just as much as any other emissions. The second thing it needs to prioritise, especially given the global economic crisis, is climate finance. Rich countries have promised to mobilise $100 billion a year to help poorer countries both decarbonise their economies and protect themselves from the impacts of climate change, which are hitting them first and worst. Governments are nowhere close to meeting that goal, despite the incredibly strong moral, political and legal imperative to do so.</p> <p><b>Mary:</b> There are many opportunities for the UK to lead global conversations on a resilient, green, inclusive economic recovery from Covid‐19. Technical bodies like the UK's Committee on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency and many from civil society<a href="#newe12203-note-0014"><sup>14</sup></a> are calling for a resilient recovery and proposing routes to get there. The UK can only be credible as the presidency of COP26 if they are implementing the actions they are calling for in their own policies – low carbon development, carbon neutrality and ambitious climate action. The UK currently has no coherence across departments – UK Export Finance still supports fossil fuel investment in developing countries and negotiations for post‐Brexit trade deals do not prioritise environmental integrity. A government‐wide pursuit of a green recovery could realign poor existing policies.</p> <p>The UK must also listen to and prioritise the needs of climate‐vulnerable states. One outcome of the Financing for Development conference held in May, was that the UK will lead a global workstream on ensuring an inclusive and sustainable recovery from Covid‐19, building on the prime minister's commitment to supporting the resilience of vulnerable countries. Finance, loss and damage and the environmental integrity of carbon markets, are all outstanding contentious issues for the COP and the UK must make efforts to bring parties to the table in 2020.</p> <p><b>IPPR: What are some of the actions that countries can take to work together to tackle the climate and ecological crisis at an international level, even while some of the major players like the USA and Brazil aren't back at the table yet?</b></p> <p><b>Tessa:</b> There is nothing stopping countries from taking individual and collective action to tackle the climate and ecological crises, even if the US and Brazil aren't at the table. The first thing to be clear about is that, as confirmed by the Dutch Supreme Court in our case against the government of the Netherlands, every country has a responsibility to take action on climate change regardless of what other countries are doing, and developed countries have to take the lead.</p> <p>Second, there are countless multilateral processes and institutions that need to be radically reformed if governments are going to take the climate crisis seriously, including trade and investment treaties. For example, the Energy Charter Treaty, which covers the trade and transit of energy in much of the EU [European Union], currently allows for energy companies to sue governments for huge amounts of compensation if they change their environmental laws to bring them in line with climate goals. Companies are already threatening to sue governments under the Treaty for phasing out coal fired power. Countries need to work together to radically rehaul regional and international trade and investment agreements so that they don't prioritise the interests of the fossil fuel industry over climate justice and our collective survival.</p> <p><b>Mary:</b> We cannot wait for conditions to be perfect before moving ahead with ambitious climate action. Whilst countries like the US, Brazil, Australia and others are impeding globally coordinated action, many people from these countries are demanding something different. Working with subnational authorities and the private sector as they respond to the demands of their constituents and clients can be a way to increase ambition. Changing the financial system to value nature, climate and biodiversity properly can help clear the way for progress. Public bodies must be held accountable for how public money is spent – it is not acceptable for countries to support the Paris Agreement and continue to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure at home or around the world.</p> <p>Nature and biodiversity are under threat. The restoration and protection of biodiversity, however, can be an action that governments take as they come through the Covid‐19 pandemic. The EU, for instance, has a 10‐year plan to protect at least 30 per cent of EU land and seas by 2030. As an ambassador for the Campaign for Nature I want to see this target taken up around the world to secure a better future for the planet, its wildlife and ourselves.</p> </div> <div class="back"
