GLASOD was criticised for perceived subjectiveness and exaggeration (Helld&#233;n and Tottrup 2008; Sonneveld and Dent 2007). Dregne and Chou (1992) found 3000 Mha in drylands (i.e.&#160;about 50% of drylands) were undergoing degradation. Signi&#64257; cant improvements have been made through the efforts of WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), LADA (Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands) and DESIRE (Deserti&#64257; cation Mitigation and Remediation of Land) who jointly developed a&#160;mapping tool for participatory expert assessment, with which land experts can estimate current area coverage, type and trends of land degradation (Reed et al. 2011).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="184.83" top="567.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="567.54" x1="184.83">A number of studies have used </span><span style="x0: 186.07; x1: 189.94; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="186.07" y0="567.54" x1="310.98">satellite-based remote sensing</span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.01; y0: 555.54; y1: 565.04; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="555.54" x1="313.27">to investigate long-term changes in the vegetation and thus identify parts of the drylands undergoing deserti&#64257; cation.

The most widely used remotely sensed vegetation index is the NDVI, providing a&#160;measure of canopy greenness that is related to the quantity of standing biomass (Bai&#160;et al. 2008; de Jong et al. 2011; Fensholt et al. 2012; Andela et al. 2013; Fensholt et al. 2015; Le et al. 2016) (Figure&#160;3.5). A&#160;main challenge associated with NDVI is that although biomass and productivity are closely related in some systems, they can differ widely when looking across land uses and ecosystem types, giving a&#160;false positive in some instances (Pattison et al. 2015; Aynekulu et al. 2017). For example, bush encroachment in rangelands and intensive monocropping with high fertiliser application gives an indication of increased productivity in satellite data though these could be considered as land degradation. According to this measure there are regions undergoing deserti&#64257; cation, however the drylands are greening on average (Figure&#160;3.6). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="450.37" top="309.15"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.9; y0: 309.15; y1: 317.15; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="309.15" x1="450.37">Figure&#160;3.5 |  Mean annual maximum NDVI 1982&#8211;2015 (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies NDVI3g v1). </span><span style="x0: 450.02; x1: 454.76; y0: 309.08; y1: 317.08; width: 4.74; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="450.02" y0="309.08" x1="571.39">Non-dryland regions (aridity index &gt;0.65) are masked in grey.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="480.72" top="73.33"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.9; y0: 73.33; y1: 81.33; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="73.33" x1="480.72">Figure&#160;3.6 |  Trend in the annual maximum NDVI 1982&#8211;2015 (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies NDVI3g v1) </span><span style="x0: 481.05; x1: 484.01; y0: 73.27; y1: 81.27; width: 2.96; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="481.05" y0="73.27" x1="571.43">calculated using the Theil&#8211;Sen estimator which is a&#160;median based estimator, and is robust to outliers.
