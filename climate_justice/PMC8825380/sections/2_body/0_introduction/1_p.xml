Per capita energy consumption can be linked not only to human development but also to infant mortality and female life expectancy (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 347; Steinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>). While a substantial number of people live in &#8216;energy poverty&#8217;, some nations have substantially high levels of per capita energy footprints. Additional use of energy would do little to raise the well-being of those already well off relative to those that are lesser well-off, whose well-being increases substantially even with modest increases in energy use (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>; Steinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>). Conversely, restricting the energy use of the most well-off would not entail substantial decreases in their well-being.</p>
