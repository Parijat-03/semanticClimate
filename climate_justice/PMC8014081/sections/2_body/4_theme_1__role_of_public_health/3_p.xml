<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It is clear that the threat&#8208;amplifying effects of the intersection of COVID&#8208;19 and climate change require a cohesive, coordinated, and comprehensive response from public health professionals and particularly public health nurses who are at the forefront of care. The response to COVID&#8208;19 demonstrates that a comprehensive approach that is embodied in the principles of public health practice is key. This pandemic response has resulted in grave concerns about the possibilities of a pandemic response intersecting with a climate change emergency (Catton,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Disasters that are occurring due to greenhouse gas emissions such as air quality issues, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, heat stress, and heat stroke due to increasing ambient temperatures, and increased vector&#8208;borne illnesses should be considered amidst the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Although greenhouse gas emissions have decreased during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, it is important to consider resurgence of these emissions post COVID&#8208;19 that are likely to occur globally.</p>
