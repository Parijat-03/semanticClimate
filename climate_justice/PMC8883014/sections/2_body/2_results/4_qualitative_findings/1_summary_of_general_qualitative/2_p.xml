Responses describing worries about climate change illustrated four major and recurrent themes: environmental damage, collective inaction, human global suffering, and individual suffering. Responses describing actions to address climate change showed that almost all participants who responded to the question&#160;engaged in individual actions that were measured in the Individual Action scale (e.g., recycling, turning off lights and saving energy). Many also detailed individual actions that were not assessed in the scale. Collective actions were less commonly described than individual actions, and all the collective actions described by the participants were included in the Climate Activism scale.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Summary of general qualitative findings</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Main worries about climate change</td></tr><tr><td>Environmental damage</td><td>Global collapse; Loss of biodiversity; Loss of places; Unpredictable weather events</td></tr><tr><td>Collective inaction</td><td>The barrier of US lifestyle; Governments&#8217; inaction (US and international); The insignificant impact of individual actions; Capitalism, Corruption; Lack of education, climate denial; Politicization and manipulation of public opinion; Indifference to existing solutions; Environmental solutions that create new problems</td></tr><tr><td>Human suffering</td><td>Disasters, starvation, health problems; Chained events: from migrations to wars; Lack of climate justice and social justice</td></tr><tr><td>Individual suffering</td><td>Relatives or one&#8217;s generation being harmed; Children, grandchildren and future generations being harmed; Considering the decision of not having children</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Actions to address climate change</td></tr><tr><td>Individual actions mentioned in existing scale</td><td>Recycling; Saving energy; Turning off lights</td></tr><tr><td>Individual actions not mentioned in existing scale</td><td>Reducing consumption of goods and production of trash, compost; Avoiding disposable, single use material, and packaging; Buying second-hand products, repairing; Buying from small, local, and sustainable businesses; Diet (reducing meat consumption, vegetarian, entirely plant-based); Producing (vegetables, herbs, skincare products); Avoiding online purchases; Transportation (walking, cycling, using public transportation, carpooling, using an electric or hybrid car, avoiding planes); Choosing a professional field to address climate change; Saving to afford climate conscious purchases (insulation, electric car, geothermal or solar energy)</td></tr><tr><td>Collective actions</td><td>Educating oneself about environmental science; Spreading awareness (online, sending emails to elected officials, talking to other people about climate change); Financial support to an environmental cause; Joining or leading advocacy groups, clubs, and student groups; Organizing events, supporting local initiatives; Supporting politicians who have introduced climate change policies and talking to friends about them; Advocating for alternative energy (i.e. nuclear power as a stop gap measure); Getting involved in research groups focused on climate change; Teaching other students about climate change</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
