<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In livestock management [<xref rid="B65-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] a pregnancy detection method was developed, which makes use of Xbee transmitters linked to LM35 temperature sensors. Two animals were experimented, with temperatures recorded at five days and twelve days from insemination. The sensing system was attached to the tail of the cows. Temperature records were found to be high in pregnant cow, especially in the evenings. The sensing unit works effectively within a distance of 40 m, and serves as a low-cost technique, when compared to some invasive pregnancy detection methods in livestock.</p>
