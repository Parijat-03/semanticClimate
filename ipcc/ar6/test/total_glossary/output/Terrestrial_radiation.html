<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Radiation emitted by the Earthâs surface, the <em>atmosphere</em> and clouds. It is also known as thermal infrared or longwave radiation and is to be distinguished from the near-infrared radiation that is part of the solar spectrum. Infrared radiation, in general, has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spectrum) longer than the wavelength of the red light in the visible part of the spectrum. The spectrum of terrestrial radiation is almost entirely distinct from that of shortwave or <em>solar radiation</em> because of the difference in temperature between the Sun and the Earthâatmosphere system.</p></dd>
