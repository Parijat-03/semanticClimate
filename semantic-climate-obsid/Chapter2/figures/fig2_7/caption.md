![[fig2_7.png]]Figure 2.7 Historic anthropogenic CO2 emission and cumulative CO2 emissions (1850-2019) as well as remaining carbon budgets for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C 
Panel a shows historic annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions (GtCO2 yr-1) by fuel type and process.

Panel b shows historic cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions for the periods 1850-1989, 1990-2009, and 20 2010-2019 as well as remaining future carbon budgets as of 1.1.2020 to limit warming to 1.5°C and 2°C at 21 the 67th percentile of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions. The whiskers indicate a budget uncertainty of ±220 GtCO2eq for each budget and the aggregate uncertainty range at 1 standard deviation for historical cumulative CO2 emissions, consistent with Working Group 1.
