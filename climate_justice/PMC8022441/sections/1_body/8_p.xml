There is significant evidence that anti-structural injustice feminist-informed activism is a significant force. Cross-national comparisons of policy transformation (Htun and Weldon, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Weldon and Htun, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and political repression of feminist activism and scholarship are two kinds of evidence of its effectiveness (Demirta&#351; and G&#252;nd&#252;z, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; O'sullivan and Kruli&#353;ov&#225;, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Non-feminist actors taking over feminist goals is also evidence of success. For example, in Cyprus, unions and to some extent political parties incorporated the goals of feminist movements such that the feminism behind these became invisible (Kamenou, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, p. 372). Achievements such as ILO 189, the Convention on Domestic Workers, are evidence of success as is the mobilization of protestors who come out together across intersecting issue areas (e.g., Women's March 2017 and Women Radically Transforming a World in Crisis 2019<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref>). In fact, the thesis of a recent popular press book is that an entire generation of US college students have fully adopted the view that all harms are a form of structural injustice (Lukianoff and Haidt, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
