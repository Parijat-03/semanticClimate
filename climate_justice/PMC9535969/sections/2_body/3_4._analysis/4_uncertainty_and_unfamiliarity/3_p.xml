When we asked them to identify potential risks, they resorted to the lack of knowledge and information to justify their inability to provide us with clear answers:<disp-quote><p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of impact this would have without knowing more about geoengineering. (CR &#8211; Group II)</p><p>I have no idea .&#8196;.&#8196;.That [impact] must be researched .&#8196;.&#8196;. [The impact] on people&#8217;s health, the balance between ecosystems .&#8196;.&#8196;.
