(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1999</xref>:12, 103) argue that poverty alleviation could be a GPG if it contributes to conflict prevention, peace, and environmental protection; even social justice that promotes productivity of the poor, and hence peace and stability, is regarded as a GPG. Adaptation emphatically fits into this category. Kaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017b</xref>) also argues that enhanced provision of GPGs can contribute to poverty reduction, if it is not financed by ODA. Along this line, we argue that providing restitution for climate justice through adaptation support in the PVCs does contribute to poverty reduction, global peace, and harmony. Actually, adaptation actions bring in a quadruple dividend: avoided losses, economic benefits through increasing productivity, and social and environmental benefits. The World Bank estimates that the added burden of Covid-19 will push an additional 88-115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, with the total rising to as many as 150 million by 2021 (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>). So supporting a series of local and national resilient societies becomes a GPG, measurably enhancing global harmony, peace, and security. The Global Commission on Adaptation calculated that every US dollar invested in building climate resilience could result in between $2 and 10 in net economic benefits (2019). Such investments in individual countries certainly have spill-over benefits beyond one&#8217;s border.</p>
