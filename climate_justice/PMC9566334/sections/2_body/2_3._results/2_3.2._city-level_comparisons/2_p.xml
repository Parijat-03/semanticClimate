<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Mean yearly summertime SUHI intensity was averaged over the 16-year time frame for prevalent census tracts in each city. This was used to examine which cities had the highest levels of SUHI intensity exposure for each prevalent demographic grouping. Comparisons of the 25 most intense cities are shown in <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The corresponding dot plots are organized by each prevalent demographic group and plot the mean SUHI intensity for their prevalent tracts in each city. The vertical red line in each plot represents the average SUHI intensity of the census tracts for the respective population group through all 16 years. Averages are significantly higher for Black (K-S <italic toggle="yes">&#961;</italic> = 0.0001) and Hispanic (K-S <italic toggle="yes">&#961;</italic> = 0.0001) groupings compared to White; the Asian percentage was not statistically different from the White (K-S <italic toggle="yes">&#961;</italic> = 0.43), likely due to the lower number of observed cities with Asian prevalent tracts. New Orleans, LA, has the highest SUHI intensity for Black prevalent tracts at nearly 6 K. San Jose, CA, is highest for Hispanic (&gt;7 K) and Asian prevalent tracts (&lt;7 K). New Orleans also has the greatest SUHI intensity for White prevalent tracts with an approximate difference of ~5.5 K. As a further example and using 4 K as an arbitrary SUHI intensity threshold, three cities exceed this intensity on average for White prevalent tracts, 12 cities for Black prevalent tracts, 22 for Hispanic prevalent tracts, and nine for Asian prevalent tracts.</p>
