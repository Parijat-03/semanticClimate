<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">All licensed or regulated jurisdictions require successful completion of two sets of standardized board exams (<uri xlink:href="https://www.nabne.org/about/">https://www.nabne.org/about/</uri>, accessed on 21 December 2021), as well as relevant local regulatory exams. All NDs are trained as generalists. Residency training is currently not a requirement for NDs, although opportunities exist, including those with a focus on pediatrics. Specialization is not recognized in most jurisdictions. However, the American Board of Naturopathic Pediatrics (an independent arm of the PedANP) offers a fellowship certification process (<uri xlink:href="https://www.pedanp.org/board-certification">https://www.pedanp.org/board-certification</uri>, accessed on 21 December 2021), which is recognized as evidence of board-certification in some regulated jurisdictions of practice.</p>
