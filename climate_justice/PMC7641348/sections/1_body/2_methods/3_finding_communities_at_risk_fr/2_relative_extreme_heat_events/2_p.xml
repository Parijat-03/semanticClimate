<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Distinct daytime and nighttime temperature extremes in heat wave calculations were maintained to distinguish the different types of future heat wave events. There are two types of heat waves examined in this study: daytime (Tmax) and nighttime (Tmin) events. Daytime and nighttime heat waves occur when daily maximum and minimum temperatures surpass the local maximum and minimum historical threshold for two consecutive days, respectively. The total number of daytime and nighttime heat waves per year, for April 1<sup>st</sup> through October 31<sup>st</sup> over the current and projected time periods, was calculated for each climate model. Across the four climate models, the average number of heat waves per year was calculated for each heat wave type in each census tract. The change in number of heat waves, compared to the current period, was then determined.</p>
