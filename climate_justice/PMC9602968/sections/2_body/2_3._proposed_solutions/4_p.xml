<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As very few rural LHDs employ specialized staff (e.g., data scientists) to begin with [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], shared service arrangements among rural LHDs may still not be enough to overcome the environmental health needs of their communities. For example, the limited specialized staff capacity among rural LHDs may limit their capacity to do higher-level analysis and implementation of BRACE, which has been criticized for being overly technical and &#8220;academic&#8221; [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, shared service arrangements can be administratively burdensome, and rural LHDs may not have the capacity to initiate or sustain them. As such, state-level support and collaboration should also be prioritized to enable rural LHDs to engage in climate change and health activities. The BRACE program, for instance, allows states to partner with counties/LHDs when applying for these funds [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
