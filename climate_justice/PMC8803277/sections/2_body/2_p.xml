Rather than expanding our remit, COVID-19 has narrowed the government&#8217;s agenda and dominated public health system capacity even while population-level health impacts of a changing climate are unfolding before our eyes. We need both eyes to see the full picture. Furthermore, we need a global perspective more than ever.
