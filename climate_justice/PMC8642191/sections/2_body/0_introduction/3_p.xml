This means that while most climate financing facilities are not explicitly identified with questions of justice (there are exceptions, such as the EU&#8217;s Just Transition Mechanism), the scope and impact of financial interventions are key determinants of climate justice outcomes. In this context, the sustainable finance frameworks of the EU and China are worthy of study not just because of their importance to the achievement of climate objectives in both economies, but also for their capacity to influence other countries and transnational markets.</p>
