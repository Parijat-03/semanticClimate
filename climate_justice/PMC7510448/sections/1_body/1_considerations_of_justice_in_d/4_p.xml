<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0060">Second, a bioenvironmentalist approach focuses on the constraints of biological limits, or the &#8220;carrying capacity&#8221; of the planet. Accordingly, bio-environmentalists see population pressure and overconsumption of natural resources as major causes of environmental degradation. Neo-Malthusian arguments about limits to growth and Hardin's tragedy of commons thus inform the policy choices of many bio-environmentalists: because they view the collective force of the human species as the main problem afflicting the planet, their solutions quickly rely on controlling the growth of world population (as argued for by Jane Goodall; see <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alberro, 2020</xref>) and the creation of large and stringently protected nature reserves free of human interventions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017b</xref>). That these approaches may lead to gross violations of human rights is increasingly recognized, including in the writings of bio-environmentalists like John <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Vidal (2016)</xref>. Some bio-environmentalists also advocate for strictly controlling consumption, including by curbing immigration from &#8220;developing countries&#8221; to the more affluent countries, because immigrants would then consume at the same level as that enjoyed by residents of wealthy countries (noted in <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clapp and Dauvergne, 2011</xref>, 238). In short, the bio-environmentalist worldview is ill-equipped to handle the complex causes of planetary crisis, including socioeconomic inequality and social injustice.</p>
