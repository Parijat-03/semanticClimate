Before the pandemic took hold, the Greater Horn of Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and southwest Asia were already facing one of the worst locust outbreaks in decades, threatening to destroy harvests and triggering food emergencies (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020b</xref>). In western Africa, the humanitarian and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have been superimposed over an ongoing regional food crisis; the combined effects of confinement, market closures, barriers to trade, and loss of income could adversely affect an additional 50 million people.<xref rid="fn0055" ref-type="fn">11</xref>

Disruptions in the food supply chain may also have wider knock-on effects. In general, the COVID-19 crisis has put significant strain on the humanitarian and food aid sector and increased vulnerabilities during emergencies.</p>
