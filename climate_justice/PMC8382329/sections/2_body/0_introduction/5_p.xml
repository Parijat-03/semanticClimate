Ironically, there is no effort at operationalizing this norm, or in codifying it through adequate adaptation support to address the &#8220;effect&#8221; part of climate change. Herein, Gardiner&#8217;s thesis of &#8220;theoretical ineptitude&#8221; (2006: 407) still persists, which manifests in undermining the agreed responsibility, and in not appreciating the spatial, temporal, or long-term dimensions of climate change. This condemns those mainly responsible to a &#8220;moral corruption.&#8221; Why should the PVCs, including the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), which contribute least to the problem, suffer the most from &#8220;imported&#8221; climate impacts (Persson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>)?</p>
