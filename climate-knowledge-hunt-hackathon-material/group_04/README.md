## What we did
We investigated the interconnectedness between various target and anchor nodes, as well as identified the appropriate attributes for linking these node pairs. Additionally, we delved into the efficiency of the tools provided by semantic climate, which facilitate rapid analysis. We emphasized the capabilities of the Summarizer and Keyword Extraction tools and discussed their practical applications for various tasks. 
### Hack session 01
Utilized the [Relation_Attribute_Annotation Colab Notebook](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/paragraphLinking/Relation_Attribute_Annotation.ipynb) to gain hands-on experience with the annotation workflow and determine the most appropriate relation attribute for connecting two nodes. Additionally, I familiarized myself with the functioning of the Semantic Climate Summarizer.
### Hack session 02
Gained some practical experience in coding the keyword extractor through the Keyword Tutorial Notebook. Further, explored various Hugging Face models and subsequently discussed additional measures that can enhance our ability to extract more cohesive and correlated keywords.
## What next?
Discussed how the Open Source LLM like Bloom can help us to better understand the interconnectedness between various target and anchor nodes.
