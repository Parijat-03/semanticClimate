In this context, innovative financing schemes are seen as critical to achieve the sustainable financing of SP (Asher, 2015; UNICEF, 2019) via social and solidarity economy, as seen in women&#8217;s autonomous adaptation measures in precautionary savings and flood preparedness in Nepal (Banerjee et&#160;al., 2019), and self-help groups as development intermediaries (Anderson, 2019). Still, there are constraints of SP to reach those who are most vulnerable to climate change and other hazards due to their legal status, such as the fact that attention to forcibly displaced populations within the SP field has been limited (Sabates-Wheeler, 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="157.89" top="570.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="570.48" x1="157.89" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 570.48; y1: 580.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.6.3 Knowledge Gaps</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="546.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="546.6" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.96; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Government SP can attenuate the negative impacts in facing disasters, depending on the differences in political systems and the focus put on sociopolitical measures (</span><span style="x0: 158.79; x1: 165.65; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="158.79" y0="522.6" x1="300.87">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span x0="300.87" y0="522.6" x1="307.72" style="x0: 300.87; x1: 303.51; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">), not only in restoring livelihoods but also in easing mental burdens faced by rural households in developing countries (Dalton et&#160;al., 2016; Kosec and Mo, 2017; Liebenehm, 2018). However, limited government capacities and fiscal feasibility may impede the expansion and effective implementation of SP as developing countries need further support to design, adjust and implement SP schemes effectively (Klonner, 2014; Schwan and Yu, 2017). Most countries have comprehensive strategies for both SP and climate change, but few have attempted to align them, as in practice they remain in separate institutional homes, governed by their own intra-sector coordination groups and funding channels (Steinbach et&#160;al., 2016; Bank, 2018b). Thus, significant knowledge gaps remain in terms of understanding the potential of SP to build long-term resilience to climate change (Ulrichs et&#160;al., 2019). Future efforts should be geared to develop climate-responsive SP policies that consider a broad range of issues including urbanisation and migration, the impact of green policies on the poor, access to essential health care and risks to socially marginalised groups (Aleksandrova, 2019).&#160;Along with strengthening links to climate information and EWS, finance for enabling SP systems to address climate-related shocks and stresses dynamically needs to be scaled up (Kuriakose et&#160;al., 2013; Ulrichs et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="250.57" top="234.48"><span style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.34; y0: 234.48; y1: 244.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="54.14" y0="234.48" x1="250.57">10.5.7 Education and Capacity Development</span></div><div left="54.14" right="163.25" top="210.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="210.48" x1="163.25" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 210.48; y1: 220.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.7.1 Point of Departure</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.75" top="186.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="186.6" x1="307.75" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asian areas with the least capacity to respond, such as the Himalayan region and densely populated deltas, are hit first and hardest by climate impacts (De Souza et&#160;al., 2015; Khan, 2017). Acknowledging the limitations in terms of capacity and coping mechanisms towards climate change, education, training and awareness building is central to sustaining long-term capacity building (Clemens et&#160;al., 2016). Education has a lot more to offer in terms of improvements in addressing climate change, particularly in the climate hotspots of Asia where mostly poor, disadvantaged communities vulnerable to climate change reside (Mani et&#160;al., 2018). In particular, when disseminated, climate-change awareness and information need more explanation (Steg et&#160;al., 2014; Wi and Chang, 2018; Cho, 2020). In addition, </span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="714.62"><span x0="318.18" y0="714.62" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 320.29; y0: 714.62; y1: 724.12; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">is critical for successful capacity building (Hemachandra, 2019), which must be designed for the long term and be self-sustaining (Gustafson et&#160;al., 2018). National ownership by recipient countries and members of communities of capacity-building efforts is key to ensuring their success (Roberts and Pelling, 2016; Mikulewicz, 2017).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="389.17" top="642.48"><span x0="318.19" y0="642.48" x1="389.17" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.99; y0: 642.48; y1: 652.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.7.2 Findings</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.76" top="618.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="618.6" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 618.6; y1: 628.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The need to develop tailored climate communication and education strategies for individual nations as public awareness and risk perceptions towards climate change vary greatly (</span><span style="x0: 503.69; x1: 510.54; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="503.69" y0="594.6" x1="571.75">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span x0="375.97" y0="582.61" x1="571.79" style="x0: 375.97; x1: 378.61; y0: 582.61; y1: 592.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Lee et&#160;al., 2015a). Improving on, and investing in, basic education, climate literacy and location-based strategies of climate change are vital to enhance public engagement, societies&#8217; adaptive capacity and support for climate action (Lutz et&#160;al., 2014c; Hu and Chen, 2016). As stated in the IPCC Special Report 1.5&#176;C, sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity and promote livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (Roy et&#160;al., 2018). Hence, various concepts are introduced to foster awareness, understanding, knowledge, participation as well as commitment towards managing climate change in a sustainable manner. One such concept is education for sustainable development (ESD), which is aimed at integrating the principles and practices of sustainable development in all aspects of education, and training individuals who will contribute to the realisation of a more sustainable society (Kitamura, 2017).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.79" top="390.63"><span x0="318.19" y0="390.63" x1="571.79" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.29; y0: 390.63; y1: 400.13; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate-change education (CCE) is also now addressed in the context of ESD and allows for learners to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, and teaches them how to take action (Mochizuki and Bryan, 2015). Both ESD and CCE are gaining broader attention, for instance, in China (Han, 2015) and the Republic of Korea (Sung, 2015); however, development of policies and implementation of initiatives regarding ESD and CCE still face a handful of challenges which require a strong political will and consensus of key stakeholders (L&#230;ss&#248;e and Mochizuki, 2015). Effective communication on CCE particularly for younger-generation engagement is also essential, as they are our future leaders as climate change is an inter-generational equity issue (Corner et&#160;al., 2015). Action for Climate Empowerment of Article 6 of the UNFCCC target youth as a major group for effective engagement in the formulation and implementation of decisions on climate change (UNFCCC, 2015). Increasing attention from countries in Asia, such as Thailand and India, will encourage innovative ways to provide adequately in educating and engaging youth in climate-change issues (Narksompong and Limjirakan, 2015; D&#252;r and Keller, 2018).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.73" top="150.66"><span x0="318.19" y0="150.66" x1="571.73" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 150.66; y1: 160.16; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An integrated approach to knowledge about climate change embraces both the importance in bridging knowledge of climate science and respecting IKLK, and should be at the heart of any effort to educate citizens to have a deeper understanding of the causes and consequence of climate change in a holistic manner (Aswani et&#160;al., 2018). Indigenous Peoples, comprising about 6% of the global population, play a crucial role in the fight against climate change for two interlinked reasons. First, they have a particular physical and spiritual relationship with land, water and associated ecosystems, and tend to be among the </span></div></body></html>
