The &#8220;curiosity cabinets&#8221; of the Renaissance period were essentially small and crowded galleries equipped with copious invertebrate and vertebrate collections, skulls, shells, plant taxonomies, rocks, fossils, and esoteric objects. Those spaces, often recreated in houses of men of wealth, were used to display private collections of all kinds of &#8220;rarities&#8221; (Friedman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>) and symbolized social status. These early first<italic>-</italic>generation science museums contained displays and collections reflecting Cameron&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1971</xref>) metaphor of the museum as &#8220;temple&#8221;, places where objects are exhibited and visitors observe quietly, passively, and reverently.</p>
