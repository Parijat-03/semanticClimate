<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par4">Many of these special issues spawned the inspiration for <italic>The Essential Clinical Social Work</italic> Series, a collection of (to date) 13 MSW student textbooks that I edit; the purpose of the series is to translate key, timely topics from the <italic>CSWJ</italic> special issues to nascent social workers seeking to&#160;hone their skills and find&#160;their niches in our ever-expanding field. Along my marathon route and in keeping with the language of millennials and Gen Z, social media became a mainstay of communication and a viable means to disseminate news about the journal publications and calls for papers; the <italic>CSWJ</italic> Twitter and Facebook accounts have proven indispensable vehicles for interacting with the readership and responding to their needs and interests through the journal content. I am indebted to Geoffrey Golia, LCSW, the founding Social Media Manager, for his foresight in establishing these accounts. Under his leadership and that of his successor, Jack Osea, MPA, the <italic>CSWJ</italic> Twitter and Facebook accounts have grown substantially (Twitter:&#8201;~&#8201;7300 followers; Facebook&#8201;~&#8201;4700 followers) and increased the reach of clinical social work.</p>
