Exploring both the fairness and corruption objections raised by Sandel via the maritime case has revealed that one of the core issues with MBMs that has been under-addressed in the ethics literature is the role they play as a diversionary tactic. Proponents claim that market approaches are better because of the neoclassical assumptions whereby the polluter can pay the external costs. However, this approach overlooks the likelihood of this price simply being absorbed. Is the goal simply that the polluter pays for their pollution and continues polluting or is the aim to change behaviour and dissuade the purchase of polluting transport services (cf. Bigger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>)? The latter aim implies that the price should be high and disruptive, yet shipping lines which had rejected anything more than a 16% increase later raised their prices by 600% and earned record profits as demand remained unchanged.</p>
