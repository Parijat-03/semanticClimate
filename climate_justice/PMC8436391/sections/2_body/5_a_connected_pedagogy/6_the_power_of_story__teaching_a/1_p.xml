<p>Now we draw on a recent example of critical pedagogy which sought to incorporate the
principles of relational practice and connectedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the
University of the Sunshine Coast, non-traditional social work placements in the form of online
student units were set up to provide alternate field education placement opportunities for
students. Simultaneously, an action-research project with the placement students as
co-researchers was conducted to explore students&#8217; learning experiences in student units
and how they were developing a social work identity under the new conditions effected by
COVID-19. A student unit is defined as a group of supervised students placed at one institution
or organization to work collaboratively on a particular task or project. Student units provide
students with a network of colleagues through which to engage in collective learning processes
