In fact, small local tax bases and LHD overreliance on fee-for-service revenue streams (e.g., regulatory permitting fees, Medicaid, Medicare, health insurance, etc.) [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] exacerbate the situation as they leave rural LHDs with limited capacity to provide complete population health services even on a &#8220;good day&#8221; [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At the same time, the structure of federal funding to support climate change and health programming has systematically reduced opportunities for meaningful engagement by rural LHDs. Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have twice funded the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) program to promote climate change and health capacity among state and local jurisdictions. The BRACE program includes a five-step process to help departments prepare for and respond to the health impacts of climate change: (1) anticipate climate impacts and assess vulnerability; (2) project the disease burden; (3) assess public health interventions; (4) develop a climate and health adaptation plan; and (5) evaluate impact and improve quality of activities [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While these funds are theoretically open to any LHD, awards are prioritized based on previous BRACE framework implementation, population size, and other factors [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As rural LHDs have less baseline capacity (e.g., because of their smaller populations, they have less funding and ability to recruit and retain staff, particularly specialized staff) [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], they may be less competitive than their state and urban counterparts, if they have the capacity to submit an application at all. As a result, although the majority of funded recipients were state-level public health agencies that include rural jurisdictions within their service areas, no awards were made directly to rural LHDs [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
