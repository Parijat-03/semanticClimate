<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We designed the workshop to introduce participants to one community organizing leadership skill: public narrative. Public narrative consists of telling (1) a story of self, which communicates the values that call one to action; (2) a story of us, which identifies values shared by the teller and potential constituents that can serve as a basis for meaningful relationships and collective action; and (3) a story of now, which communicates an urgent challenge to those shared values that demands immediate action.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In an effort to create an efficient introductory module that could be readily incorporated into health equity and leadership development curricula, we focused this workshop on learning to craft a story of self, as this process of identifying and communicating one's values lays the groundwork for the rest of public narrative. We then situated the story of self within the broader context of public narrative and community organizing to help participants understand how the practice could be implemented. Through telling a story of self, participants also had an opportunity to reconnect with their internal motivations for pursuing health equity and, in doing so, could find inspiration for ongoing engagement in advocacy during and after residency.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
