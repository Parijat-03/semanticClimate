Attitudes toward specific climate policies are mixed, and sensitive to question wording. Support tends to be high for renewable energy investment and broad climate policy pronouncements (Bowman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>; Stoutenborough et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2014</xref>), but lower for more complex policies and for those imposing costs (Stokes and Warshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2017</xref>).</p>
