Decarbonization goals should align with the latest evidence-based recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The short-term goal is to halve emissions by 2030, and institutions in HICs should make further and more rapid reductions. The United Nations&#8211;backed Race to Zero initiative provides strategic guidance and an accountability framework for reducing emissions in public and private sector organizations.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Currently more than 5,000 businesses and 1,000 academic institutions have joined the Race to Zero.
