[<xref rid="B38-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] used a 4 cm Sensefly Swinglet UAV to differentiate green cover from grape canopy. A digital surface model (DSM) with 3 dimensions was adopted to create an exact digital terrain models (DTM), acquired via the use of processing libraries of python, and subsequently subtracted from DSM, so as to arrive at a differential digital model (DDM) for the measured terrain (a vineyard). Vine pixels within the DDM were obtained by selection of pixels &gt;50 cm elevation from the ground. The results indicated that there is a possibility of separating vine row pixels from green cover pixels, as a differential digital model pointed to values ranging from &#8211;0.1 m to +1.5 m. Furthermore, manual polygon delineation, which depended on an RGB image of the vine rows and green cover, revealed huge differences averaging 1.23 m and 0.08 m for vine and ground, respectively. Elevation of the vine rows was good and tallied with its topping height of 1.35 m from the field [<xref rid="B38-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The authors noted that vine pixels extraction would aid future analyses, such as pixels&#8217; supervised classification.</p>
