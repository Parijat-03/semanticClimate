      <td>Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming,\nwith global surface temperature reaching 1.1&#176;C above 1850&#8211;1900 in 2011&#8211;2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions\nhave continued to increase over 2010&#8211;2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from\nunsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production\nacross regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high confidence). Human-caused climate\nchange is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to\nwidespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related\nlosses and damages63 to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically\ncontributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high confidence).</td>
