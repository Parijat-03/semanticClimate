New clients have been taken on by SMLS where there are significant social justice considerations requiring urgent attention, such as employment law matters. The SMLS is also running duty lawyer services remotely, working very closely with courts and legal aid authorities. Both MLC and SMLS have also developed digital versions of their community development&#160;programmes.</p>
