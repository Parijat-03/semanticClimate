<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We recruited 170 UCSD students between 18 and 38 years of age through online department platforms and by flyers posted on the campus of UC San Diego. The inclusion criteria were that participants were enrolled at UCSD, that they believed in anthropogenic global heating and that they had no or low prior engagement in climate activism (see Screening Survey). The drop-out rate was higher than expected: 30% of the participants dropped out before the study began, and 13% dropped out during the three-month study period, so the final sample was <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 96 (22 males, 72 females and 2 unspecified). 20% of the participants were Caucasian, 51% Asian, 18% Hispanic/Latino and 11% had other ethnic/racial backgrounds. 75% of the participants identified as Democrats, 5% as Republicans and 20% as Other.</p>
