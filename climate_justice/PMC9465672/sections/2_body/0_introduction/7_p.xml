Due to the country's topography and ecology, extensive marshy forests of mangroves can be found along the coast. These forests are often surrounded by mudflats along the seaside and by rice fields inland. There are many offshore islands of the Bijag&#243;s archipelago, but extensive intertidal areas surrounded by mangroves and inlets are also perceived as isles by their inhabitants and neighbours (given that contact with the mainland requires a canoe). The country has a low Human Development Index value (0.480 in 2019) and is characterized by poor governance, political instability, and deteriorating social and economic conditions (e.g., Chabal &amp; Green, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>).</p>
