      <td>and change. Over the past years, the frequency of droughts, cyclones, and hailstorms has increased, with severe droughts in eight\nof 15 years between 2002 and 2017 (Srinivasa Rao et al. 2016; Mujumdar et al. 2017). Such droughts result in large yield declines\nfor major crops like wheat in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Zhang et al. 2017). The development of a submersible pump technology in\nthe 1990s, combined with public policies that provide farmers with free electricity for groundwater irrigation, resulted in a dramatic\nincrease in irrigated agriculture (Shah et al. 2012). This shift has led to increased dependence on irrigation from groundwater and\ninduced a groundwater crisis, with large impacts on socio-ecosystems. An increasing number of farmers report bore-well failures,\neither due to excessive pumping of an existing well or a lack of water in new wells. The decrease in the groundwater table level has\nsuppressed the recharge of river beds, turning permanent rivers into ephemeral streams (Srinivasan et al. 2015). Wells have recently\nbeen drilled in upland areas, where groundwater irrigation is also increasing (Robert et al. 2017). Additional challenges include\ndeclining soil organic matter and fertility under monocultures and rice/wheat systems. Unoccupied land is scarce, meaning that the\npotential for expanding the area farmed is very limited (Aggarwal et al. 2018). In rural areas, diets are deficient in protein, dietary fibre\nand iron, and mainly comprised of cereals and pulses grown and/or procured through welfare programmes (Vatsala et al. 2017).\nCultivators are often indebted, and suicide rates are much higher than the national average, especially for those strongly indebted\n(Merriott 2016). Widespread use of diesel pumps for irrigation, especially for paddies, high use of inorganic fertilisers and crop\nresidue burning lead to high GHG emissions (Aggarwal et al. 2018). The Climate-Smart Village (CSV) approach aims at increasing farm\nyield, income, input use efficiency (water, nutrients, and energy) and reducing GHG emissions (Aggarwal et al. 2018). Climate-smart\nagriculture interventions are considered in a broad sense by including practices, technologies, climate information services, insurance,\ninstitutions, policies, and finance. Options differ based on the CSV site, its agro-ecological characteristics, level of development, and the\ncapacity and interest of farmers and the local government (Aggarwal et al. 2018). Selected interventions included crop diversification,\nconservation agriculture (minimum tillage, residue retention, laser levelling), improved varieties, weather-based insurance, agro-\nadvisory services, precision agriculture and agroforestry. Farmers&#8217; cooperatives were established to hire farm machinery, secure\ngovernment credit for inputs, and share experiences and knowledge. Tillage practices and residue incorporation increased rice&#8211;wheat\nyields by 5&#8211;37%, increased income by 28&#8211;40%, reduced GHG emissions by 16&#8211;25%, and increased water-use efficiency by 30% (Jat\net al. 2015). The resulting portfolio of options proposed by the CSV approach has been integrated with the agricultural development\nstrategy of some states like Haryana.</td>

      <td>beyond their adaptive capacities, leading to an increase in mortality rates of 30&#8211;130% in major cities in developed countries\n(Norton et al. 2015). Increased mortality and morbidity from extreme heat events are exacerbated in urban populations by the urban\nheat island effect (Gabriel and Endlicher 2011; Schatz and Kucharik 2015), which can be limited by developing green infrastructure in\ncities. Urban green infrastructure includes public and private green spaces &#8211; such as remnant native vegetation, parks, private gardens,\ngolf courses, street trees, urban farming &#8211; and more engineered options, such as green roofs, green walls, biofilters and raingardens\n(Norton et al. 2015). Increasing the amount of vegetation, or green infrastructure, in a city is one way to help reduce urban air\ntemperature maxima and variation. Increasing vegetation by 10% in Melbourne, Australia was estimated to reduce daytime urban\nsurface temperatures by approximately 1&#176;C during extreme heat events (Coutts and Harris 2013). Urban farming (a type of urban\ngreen infrastructure) is largely driven by the desire to reconnect food production and consumption (Whittinghill and Rowe 2012)\n(Chapter 5). Even though urban farming can only meet a very small share of the overall urban food demand, it provides fresh and\nlocal food, especially perishable fruits and crops that are usually shipped from far and sold at high prices (Thomaier et al. 2015).\nFood-producing urban gardens and farms are often started by grassroots initiatives (Ercilla-Montserrat et al. 2019) that occupy vacant\nurban spaces. In recent years, a growing number of urban farming projects (termed Zero-Acreage farming, or Z-farming, Thomaier\net al. 2015) were established in and on existing buildings, using rooftop spaces or abandoned buildings through contracts between\nfood businesses and building owners. Almost all Z-farms are located in cities with more than 150,000 inhabitants, with a majority in\nNorth American cities such as New York City, Chicago and Toronto (Thomaier et al. 2015). They depend on the availability of vacant\nbuildings and roof tops, thereby competing with other uses, such as roof-based solar systems. Urban farming, however, has potentially\nhigh levels of soil pollution and air pollutants, which may lead to crop contamination and health risks. These adverse effects could be\nreduced on rooftops (Harada et al. 2019) or in controlled environments.</td>
