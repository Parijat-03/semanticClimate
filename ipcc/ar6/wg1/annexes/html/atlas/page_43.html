In the future, a decrease in 4 precipitation is also expected over some countries such as Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (Ozturk et 5 al., 2017). 6 7 According to the results based on statistical downscaling of 18 CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs) 8 under RCP4.5, precipitation increases at an average rate of 4.63 mm per decade in Central Asia during the 9 2021&#8211;2060 period relative to 1965&#8211;2004, while the temperature increases at a rate 0.37&#176;C per decade. 10 Results show that changes in precipitation are projected to have strong spatiotemporal differences with 11 decreasing trends occurring in the central and southern parts of Central Asia during summer. The maximum 12 expected warming rate appeared in the northern part of Central Asia while warming was most conspicuous in 13 summer among all seasons (Luo et al., 2019). 14 15 Based on the outputs of the five out of 28 CMIP5 models that performed best in simulating the current 16 climate of the region, relatively strong increasing rates in annual precipitation (over 3 mm per decade in 17 RCP2.6 and over 6 mm per decade in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are located over northern Central Asia and the 18 north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (Huang et al., 2014a). 19 20 According to the projections of changes in temperature and precipitation from these five GCMs for the 21 2071&#8211;2099 period compared to the 1951&#8211;1980 baseline for the Central Asia region, warming over the land is 22 expected to be greater than the global mean. The multi-model mean of boreal summer warming in 2071&#8211;23 2099 is projected to be about 2.5&#176;C and 6.5&#176;C above 1951&#8211;1980 at 2&#176;C and 4&#176;C global warming levels 24 respectively.

Global 30 climate models project temperatures in arid Central Asia will increase by 1&#176;C&#8211;2&#176;C in 2031&#8211;2050, with the 31 greatest increases in wintertime, but some models project greater aridity in the future although others project 32 less aridity. Yang et al. (2017) using 21 GCMs to detect future climate change in Central Asia, showed that 33 at the end of the 21st century (2070&#8211;2099) under RCP8.5, compared to the control period (1976&#8211;2005), 34 annual mean temperature and mean annual precipitation will rise by 4.8&#176;C and 5.2% respectively, while 35 mean annual snowfall will decrease by 26.5%. Luo et al. (2018) used 37 GCMs outputs statistically 36 downscaled for precipitation and temperature in Xinjiang, China in order to define spatiotemporal 37 characteristics of climate trends.

More extreme rainfall events are predicted to occur during summer and autumn. 41 42 Results of studies for the CORDEX-MENA domain comprising West Asia have found an overall strong 43 warming for both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Bucchignani et al., 2018; Ozturk et al., 2018). This 44 warming is characterized by a marked seasonality, ranging from a minimum of 2.5&#176;C in winter to a 45 maximum of 8&#176;C in summer. In winter and spring seasons, the largest increases were projected over high-46 altitude areas of Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan, in particular over the Hindu Kush (see Atlas.5.10.1) 47 &#8211; an 800-km long mountain range that separates climate zones B and D based on K&#246;ppen-Geiger evaluation. 48 Large increases were also projected at the boundary between Iran and Iraq. Results of precipitation 49 projections over subregion B and D which includes West Asia were not significant (Bucchignani et al., 50 2018). 51 52 In order to reduce knowledge gaps at the time of the AR5 on changes in climate over the Arabian Peninsula, 53 simulations of CMIP3 and CMIP5 models were analysed (e.g. Barfus and Bernhofer, 2014; Almazroui et al., 54 2016, 2017b, 2017c; Almazroui, 2019; Syed et al., 2019).
