The Advisory Council is comprised of 8 citizen scientists, including 4 youth, 2 Elders, and 2 decision makers. Other communities in the north will be invited to collaborate and customize the digital platform as part of the FEEDS scale-up. The FEEDS Project was approved by the research ethics boards of the University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan through a synchronized review protocol (REB# 2017-29).</p>
