Hodson and Marvin's (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0149" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) notion of urban ecological security has been followed by studies that characterize security as an urban issue Simon and Leck (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0267" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and, more recently, by studies that aim to define anticipatory action as a means to respond to economic and environmental threats (White, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0292" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Carbon control emerges as a powerful discourse in this context, encapsulating an array of new mechanisms of accounting and standardization to produce appropriate rationalities for climate change governance (Gesing, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0131" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Climate change becomes a political issue that allows for actors to gain authority over new policy domains, such as housing (Cauvain, Karvonen, &amp; Petrova, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0088" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Edwards &amp; Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0122" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Attempts to map interconnections within the urban fabric, such as studies of the water&#8211;energy&#8211;food nexus, reveal similar logics of control (Artioli, Acuto, &amp; McArthur, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
