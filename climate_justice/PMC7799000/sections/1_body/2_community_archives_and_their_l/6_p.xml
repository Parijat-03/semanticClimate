<bold>D<sc>Hody</sc>:</bold> For our influenza collecting, we hired a community organizer to work with the public on how the 1918 influenza pandemic affected their families and their community. We did find that even though this flu pandemic happened one hundred years ago, it was still profoundly emotionally traumatic because people who had parents who had died in the pandemic were still alive; they had the stories that they heard and told. We digitized over thirty thousand death records of people who had died between 1918 and 1919. You could actually find death records organized by your neighborhood and find out if somebody had died at the house you were living in. That's another thing people wanted to find out.</p>
