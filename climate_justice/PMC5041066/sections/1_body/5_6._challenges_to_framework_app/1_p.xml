Its practical application relies on data availability and collaboration between health and environment sectors, as well as between practitioners and academia. Critical assessment of the concept through testing it in actual adaptation evaluation situations is necessary to refine the guiding questions for each context. Nonetheless, as a first template, the framework serves both policymakers and researchers to link ethics to the climate change and health discourse.</p>
