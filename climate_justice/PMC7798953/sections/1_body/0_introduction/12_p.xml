<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">During three days of Zoom conversations, we asked these participants how they and their organizations are documenting the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and racial inequality, and what we can learn from the past. What follows are edited transcripts from our conversations, in three sections: &#8220;Precedents to Documenting COVID-19,&#8221; &#8220;Viral Lessons,&#8221; related to how current collection efforts might serve public health and medical science, and &#8220;Viral Inequalities and an Ethics of Care.&#8221;</p>
