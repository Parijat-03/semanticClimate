To improve the monitoring capability and technical level of deserti&#64257;cation studies, the monitoring network system has been strengthened, and the popularisation and application of modern technologies have been intensi&#64257;ed (e.g.,&#160;information technology and remote sensing) (Wu et al. 2015).

For example, some tree species selected were not well suited to local soil and climatic conditions (Zhu et al. 2007), and there was inadequate consideration of the limitation of the amount of available water on the carrying capacity of trees in some arid regions (Dai 2011; Feng et al. 2016) (Section&#160;3.6.4). In addition, at the beginning of the projects, there was an inadequate consideration of the effects of climate change on combating deserti&#64257;cation (Feng et al. 2015; Tan and Li 2015). Indeed, climate change and human activities over past years have in&#64258;uenced the deserti&#64257;cation and dust storm control effects in China (Feng et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2009; Tan and Li 2015), and future climate change will bring new challenges for combating deserti&#64257;cation in China (Wang et al. 2017; Yin et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2019). In particular, the deserti&#64257;cation risk in China will be enhanced at 2&#176;C compared to&#160;1.5&#176;C global temperature rise (Ma et al. 2018). Adapting deserti&#64257;cation control to climate change involves: improving the adaptation capacity to climate change for afforestation and grassland management by executing SLM practices; optimising the agricultural and animal husbandry structure; and using big data to meet the water resources regulation (Zhang and Huisingh 2018). In particular, improving scienti&#64257;c and technological supports in deserti&#64257;cation control is crucial for adaptation to climate change and combating deserti&#64257;cation, including protecting vegetation in deserti&#64257;cation-prone lands by planting indigenous plant species, facilitating natural restoration of vegetation to conserve biodiversity, employing arti&#64257;cial rain or snow, water-saving irrigation and water storage technologies (Jin et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="201.7" top="111.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 111.42; y1: 121.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="111.42" x1="201.7">1.7.2.2 The Green Dam in Algeria</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="87.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 87.52; y1: 97.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="87.52" x1="313.23">After independence in 1962, the Algerian government initiated measures to replant forests destroyed by the war, and the steppes affected by deserti&#64257;cation, among its top priorities (Belaaz 2003). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="541.35" top="735.53"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 735.53; y1: 745.03; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.53" x1="541.35">In 1972, the government invested in the Green Dam (</span><span style="x0: 541.35; x1: 546.28; y0: 735.53; y1: 745.03; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="541.35" y0="735.53" x1="571.77">Barrage vert</span><span style="x0: 337.61; x1: 340.25; y0: 723.53; y1: 733.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="337.61" y0="723.53" x1="571.77">) project. This was the &#64257;rst signi&#64257;cant experiment to combat deserti&#64257;cation, in&#64258;uence the local climate and decrease the aridity by restoring a&#160;barrier of trees. The Green Dam extends across arid and semi-arid zones between the isohyets 300 mm and 200 mm. It is a&#160;3 Mha band of plantation running from east to west (Figure&#160;3.12). It is over 1200 km long (from the Algerian&#8211;Moroccan border to the Algerian&#8211;Tunisian border) and has an average width of about 20 km. The soils in the area are shallow, low in organic matter and susceptible to erosion. The main objectives of the project were to conserve natural resources, improve the living conditions of local residents and avoid their exodus to urban areas. During the &#64257;rst four decades (1970&#8211;2000) the success rate was low (42%) due to lack of participation by the local population and the choice of species (Bensaid 1995). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="543.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="543.55" x1="571.77">The Green Dam did not have the desired effects. Despite tree-planting efforts, deserti&#64257;cation intensi&#64257;ed on the steppes, especially in south-western Algeria, due to the prolonged drought during the 1980s. Rainfall declined in the range from 18% to 27%, and the dry season has increased by two months in the last century (Belala et al. 2018). Livestock numbers in the Green Dam regions, mainly sheep, grew exponentially, leading to severe overgrazing, causing trampling and soil compaction, which greatly increased the risk of erosion. Wind erosion, very prevalent in the region, is due to climatic conditions and the strong anthropogenic action that reduced the vegetation cover. The action of the wind carries &#64257;ne particles such as sands and clays and leaves on the soil surface a&#160;lag-gravel pavement, which is unproductive. Water erosion is largely due to torrential rains in the form of severe thunderstorms that disintegrate the bare soil surface from raindrop impact (Achite et al. 2016). The detached soil and nutrients are transported offsite via runoff, resulting in loss of fertility and water holding capacity. The risk of and severity of water erosion is a&#160;function of human land-use activities that increase soil loss through removal of vegetative cover. The National Soil Sensitivity to Erosion Map (Salamani et al. 2012) shows that more than 3&#160;Mha of land in the steppe provinces are currently experiencing intense wind activity (Houyou et al. 2016) and that these areas are at particular risk of soil erosion.
