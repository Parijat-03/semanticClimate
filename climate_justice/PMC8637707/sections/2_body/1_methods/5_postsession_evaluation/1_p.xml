evaluation survey, linked to the acquisition of CEUs. Questions included whether
the objectives of the course were met, the content was evidence-based, and if
participants were able to ask questions to the SMEs. Additionally, participants
were asked if they are likely to use the knowledge they gained and if they felt
they were better able to communicate after the training. Response options ranged
from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Lastly, participants were asked (in a
free text field) what changes they might consider making to their practice after
the training. These responses were grouped into broad categories (eg, improve my
health education techniques; increase my climate change education to my
patients, etc). The 7 most common response categories are reported.</p>
