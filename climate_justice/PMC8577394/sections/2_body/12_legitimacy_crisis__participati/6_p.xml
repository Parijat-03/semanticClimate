She noted that the previous plan amounted to a design concept and was never intended to actually be built and was never deemed feasible. World-leading architects and designers came up with a novel approach to resilience infrastructure, she argued, but never considered crucial engineering problems that could arise and put the project in peril. Sitting next to Mayor de Blasio at a press conference in March 2019, she said: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to realize that the BIG U was a concept. The BIG U has inspired the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project. The city has moved forward with planning and engineering analyses for this project. This project that we&#8217;re presenting now takes that conversation forward and proposes projects that we can actually implement.&#8221; Two months later she repeated a similar thought at a public conference in a glass-walled conference room in lower Manhattan, differentiating between public works and private design concepts<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref>: &#8220;it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that this [the old ESCR] was not a city concept, but rather a concept developed by a private firm, the Bjarke Ingels Group. This project [&#8230;] ultimately helped us secure funding for the ESCR Project.&#8221; Both statements appear to conflict with the official timeline of the plans and the experience of everyone involved: the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project existed with this name since early 2015, and the participatory design process continued for three years afterward.</p>
