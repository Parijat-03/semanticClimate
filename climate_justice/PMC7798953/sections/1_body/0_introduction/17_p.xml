<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A flurry of crowdsourcing, social media gathering, and other digital collecting was initiated throughout the country after many public historians began teleworking in March, totaling over one hundred projects by the beginning of May. These efforts increased dramatically as protests raged. For instance, numerous public history professors and their students have been participating in the digital curatorial collaborative on Covid-19, <italic>A Journal of the Plague Year</italic>, initiated by Arizona State University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.covid-19archive.org">http://www.covid-19archive.org</ext-link>). (Note that in a future Public History Reviews section, we will address public history, protests, and the Black Lives Matter movement.) These digital initiatives highlight what Shaw describes here as &#8220;the dearth of material culture in the COVID-19 response,&#8221; accentuated by our inability to be in physical proximity to one another. Yet, many institutions and groups are collecting&#8212;mostly stories but also objects&#8212;and thinking about inclusion, equity, and the ethics of collecting. We also hear from Dhody about how she and others are uncovering &#8220;viral histories,&#8221; using new technologies to mine the M&#252;tter Museum's specimen collections and &#8220;accidental&#8221; biorepositories, such as envelopes from the 1918&#8211;1919 period, sealed with senders' spit and containing letters that narrate their flu experiences&#8212;a treasure trove of medical history.</p>
