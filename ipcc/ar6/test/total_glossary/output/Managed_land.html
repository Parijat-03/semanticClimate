<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">In the context of national <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> inventories under the <em>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</em>, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006) defines managed land âwhere human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functionsâ. IPCC (2006) defines <em>anthropogenic</em> GHG emissions and removals in the <em>LULUCF</em> sector as all those occurring on âmanaged landâ. The key rationale for this approach is that the preponderance of anthropogenic effects occurs on managed lands. [Note: More details can be found in IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, Volume 4, Chapter 1.]</p></dd>
