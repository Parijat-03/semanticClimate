<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most ECHO programs include course participants sharing real, de-identified
patient cases. Therefore, creating simulated cases for the CCHH ECHO is a novel
adaptation of ECHO's successful case-based learning approach. Because patients
do not join ECHO sessions, the use of simulated cases allows for climate change
cases to be developed for a variety of health professionals as well as diverse,
rural, underserved, and disproportionately impacted populations globally.
Project ECHO has used simulated learning for many years in their MOCK ECHO
trainings, whereby health professionals can practice their skills repeatedly in
a safe environment before they launch a live ECHO session.<sup>
