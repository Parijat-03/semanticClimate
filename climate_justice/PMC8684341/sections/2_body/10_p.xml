As Rob White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>) argues in his review, this means nothing short of the abolition of private property and full socialization of the corporate enterprise. Only then can we hope for de-commodification of all the elements upon which human life depends. White&#8217;s position is, for my money, inarguable. Indeed, as a formulation, it goes beyond simply killing the corporation. Yet we have to specify the institutional/constitutional form that capital and private property takes. <italic>Ecocide: Kill the Corporation Before It Kills Us</italic> (2020) does this in order to show how the social relationships that shape the corporation, and are embodied in the corporation, must be dismantled. As critical criminologists and legal scholars, we also have a responsibility to specify how law upholds the social relations of power upon which capitalism is based. And a major part of this task is to describe, in brutally honest terms, the prospects for dismantling the system. To map out the institutional detail of what must be disarmed and dismantled is to quite simply demonstrate that <italic>any</italic> social revolution that allows us to seriously and effectively confront the industrial and political conditions of climate change will not be quick or uncomplicated. The corporation will not simply wither seamlessly in the wake of an uprising of social movements.</p>
