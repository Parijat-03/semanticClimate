Each of the three key participants in clinic-based services&#8212;clients, students, and supervisors&#8212;should recognise and accept that remote communication can be both harder and more time consuming. Clinicians have the key role of structuring interview and advice processes to make the communications as effective as possible. The opportunities for students to engage in &#8216;ecological learning&#8217; will be very different. They will not have opportunities to learn directly from being part of the clinic workplace, seeing the dynamics between different staff, different disciplines, and working with other agencies.</p>
