It is true, however, that China has been coherent with its diplomatic principle of non-interference in domestic affairs. In both cases, there is the need to address actors&#8217; practices beyond the climate agenda&#8217;s fragmented institutional spaces. There is a need to analyze existing contradictions outside climate regime&#8217;s normative borders, as well as to rethink whether the development models that states and regional actors export generate the same conditions to which capitalism has historically submitted societies: global social inequalities, structured in different ways, from slavery to necropolitics (Mbembe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>). This helps us to think how development and the discourse of global powers on &#8216;good policies&#8217; and &#8216;best practices&#8217; require another stance of more in-depth debates on climate justice involving antiracist economic and governance conditionalities.</p>
