<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A qualitative or quantitative representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes and accounting for some of its known properties.</p>
<p>The <em>climate system</em> can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrisations are involved. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate the <em>climate</em> and for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual <em>climate predictions</em>.</p>
