Women's movement organizations have decades (in fact we are celebrating over a century) of experience working against the full gamut of oppressive politics. Their movements and movement organizations are as varied as women and their contexts. Women's funds are relatively small philanthropic organizations that accept donations and make grants in relatively small amounts to women's organizations. Examples include the Global Fund for Women, MamaCash, Urgent Action Fund, Astraea, Frida, and the networked members of Prospera. Feminist philanthropy takes on power dynamics even though the sources of philanthropic resources may be deeply implicated in these. By looking at the work that women's funds support, we can see that a process exists for supporting anti-structural injustice movements that resist &#8220;anti&#8221; group discourses and undermine &#8220;othering&#8221; but which, like antidemocratic populism, are able to form coalitional politics across concerns about structural injustice (Ackerly, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
