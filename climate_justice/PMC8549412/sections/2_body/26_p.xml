The most important element I would like to emphasize is that such a common vision calls for strengthening unity and alliances between our organizations, and different movements. The statement highlights that this counter-mobilization generated a positive effect in terms of a more consolidated convergence of organizations working on the issues of health and nutrition. But also, a convergence between the perspectives of consumers&#8217;, climate justice and food sovereignty organizations. I would also stress the very strong presence of feminist organizations, across all these domains, as well. Therefore, the common vision is one of unity and of reinforcing those alliances.</p>
