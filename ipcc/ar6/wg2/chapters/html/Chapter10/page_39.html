Among the more vulnerable areas include mountain agriculture where fluctuation in crop production (Poudel and Shaw, 2016; Hussain et&#160;al., 2019), and food insufficiency, is more widespread than in lowland areas (Poudel and Shaw, 2015; Kohler and Maselli, 2009). Also vulnerable are flood-prone areas like the Vietnam Mekong River Delta where 39% of the total rice area is exposed to sustained flood risks (Wassmann et&#160;al., 2019a). Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation levels will persist to be important vulnerability drivers that will shape agricultural productivity particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia as well as in selected areas of the region. With the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events, such as strong typhoons in the Philippines, the agriculture sector in the typhoon-prone areas of Southeast and East Asia, as well as the Indus Delta, will be more vulnerable to crop destruction (Mallari and Ezra, 2016). Projections on increasing SLR and flooding, such as those in Bangladesh and the Mekong Delta, will submerge and decrease crop production areas and severely affect agriculture and fishery sectors, but will also trigger outmigration from these areas (ADB, 2017b).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.73" top="438.63"><span x0="54.14" y0="438.63" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.24; y0: 438.63; y1: 448.13; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Vulnerability of aquaculture-related livelihoods to climate change was assessed at the global scale using the MAGICC/SCENGEN climate modelling tools, and Vietnam and Thailand were identified as most vulnerable in brackish-water aquaculture production (Handisyde et&#160;al., 2017). China, Vietnam and the Philippines are also ranked highly vulnerable in marine production. Moreover, a recent vulnerability assessment of Korean aquaculture based on predicted changes in seawater temperature and salinity according to RCP8.5 indicated that vulnerability was highest for seaweed, such as laver and sea mustard, while fish, shrimp and abalone are relatively less vulnerable as they are less sensitive to high water temperature and their farming environments are controllable to a large extent (Kim et&#160;al., 2019a).

In Thailand, for instance, a 38% reduction (from 21,486 to 13,328&#160;million at the present value (1 USD = 33.54 THB) in the export values of rice and products in the last quarter of 2011 has been attributed not only to the impact of tropical cyclone Nock-Ten on Thai rice export but also the economic slowdown in Thailand during 2011&#8211;2012 (Nara et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.73" top="150.67"><span x0="54.14" y0="150.67" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.24; y0: 150.67; y1: 160.17; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Considering the high vulnerability of Asia to climate change as a whole, there is a need to look at the drivers of vulnerability in an integrated and comprehensive manner. The increasing interest on nexus studies that links climate-change impacts on agriculture with the other sectors like water, energy, land-use change, urbanisation, poverty, economic liberalisation and others (see, for example, Takama et&#160;al., 2016; Aich et&#160;al., 2017; Eslamian et&#160;al., 2017; Duan et&#160;al., 2019b) could contribute to a systemwide vulnerability reduction and an important initial step towards a more climate-resilient future.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.73" top="702.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="702.6" x1="571.73" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Since AR5, there has been a surge in the volume of literature that documents and assesses the different adaptation practices already employed in Asian agriculture as well as those that provide future adaptation options.

Recent literature, therefore, focuses on how to build on current adaptation initiatives and processes to improve current and future outcomes (Iizumi, 2019).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.76" top="570.62"><span x0="318.19" y0="570.62" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 570.62; y1: 580.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asian farmers and fishers already employ a variety of adaptation practices to minimise the adverse impacts of climate change. In a recent systematic and comprehensive review of farmers&#8217; adaptation practices in Asia, Shaffril et&#160;al. (2018) categorised these practices into different forms such as crop management, irrigation and water management, farm management, financial management, physical infrastructure management and social activities. &#8216;Climate-smart agriculture&#8217;&#8211;an integrated approach for developing agricultural strategies that address the intertwined challenges of food security and climate change&#8211;is increasingly being promoted in many parts of the region, especially in Southeast and South Asia, with potentially promising outcomes (Chandra et&#160;al., 2017; Khatri-Chhetri et&#160;al., 2017; Shirsath et&#160;al., 2017; Westermann et&#160;al., 2018; Wassmann et&#160;al., 2019b). Site-specific adaptations, such as those in Pakistan, include farmers&#8217; utilisation of several adaptation techniques which include changing crop type and variety, and improving seed quality; fertiliser application and use of pesticides, and planting of shade trees; and water storage and farm diversification (Fahad and Wang, 2018), as well as the implementation of comprehensive climate information services for farming communities (World Meteorological Organization, 2017).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.77" top="318.65"><span x0="318.19" y0="318.65" x1="571.77" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 318.65; y1: 328.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation measures are also beneficial to small-scale fishers and fish farmers (Miller et&#160;al., 2018), and through fisheries management plans (FMP) and Early warning systems, the Asian region is reducing climate impact (FAO, 2018c). The most common FMPs adopted in different Asian countries are limits to fishing gear, licensing schemes and seasonal closures (ILO, 2015), protection of nursery grounds, providing alternative livelihoods (Azad, 2017), limiting fish aggregating devices (FADs) and introduction of monitoring and control tools (Department of Fisheries (Thailand), 2015). Fishers&#8217; strong sense of belonging to their place of residence and the sense of responsibility to protect the vulnerable fish stock has been advantageously used for developing cooperatives and starting community-based fisheries management (FAO, 2012; ILO, 2015; Shaffril et&#160;al., 2017), and these initiatives have yielded positive results.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="569.5" top="138.67"><span x0="318.19" y0="138.67" x1="569.5" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 320.49; y0: 138.67; y1: 148.17; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In aquaculture, most households in shrimp communities rely on process-oriented multiple coping mechanisms such as consumption smoothing, income smoothing and migration that enhance farmers&#8217; resilience to climate anomalies (Kais and Islam, 2018). Diversification and integration of varied resources and interventions in feed and husbandry are seen to help the aqua farmers increase their profits and overcome the impacts of climate change (Henriksson et&#160;al., 2019). Strategies like polyculture, integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and recirculating aquaculture </span></div></body></html>
