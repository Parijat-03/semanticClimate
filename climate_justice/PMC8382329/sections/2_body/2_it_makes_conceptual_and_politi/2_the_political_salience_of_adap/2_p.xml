Klein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>) argues that from an operational viewpoint, it makes &#8220;common sense&#8221; to integrate adaptation with development, but from a policy perspective it blurs adaptation finance with ODA. Actually, these two forms of funding are fungible, where recipient countries can realign their spending for an adaptation-development mix (Eyckmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). The development literature now talks more about climate-resilient development, to emphasize the link between adaptation and development (Fankhauser and Schmidt-Taub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>; Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2009</xref>). Fankhauser and McDermott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) show that economic development affects both the supply and demand for adaptation. Now, developing countries support mainstreaming, but where is the new and additional, adequate, and predictable finance, as agreed under the regime? The share of climate finance in ODA is going up, to 26% in 2018, from 18% in 2013-2014 and 4% in 2003-2004 (OECD-DCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>), but ODA is going down, and this appears to be a simple displacement of ODA. Kaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017c</xref>) laments that it is worrisome to watch the present &#8220;beauty competition&#8221; among development agencies, vying for being No. 1 in terms of taking climate finance out of ODA.</p>
