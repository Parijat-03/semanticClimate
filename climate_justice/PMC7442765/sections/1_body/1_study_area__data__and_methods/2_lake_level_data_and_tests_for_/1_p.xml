<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par8">The main data source for the study was a long-term record of mean monthly lake levels, from 1899 to 2017 from which mean annual lake levels, annual maximum series (AMS), and partial duration series (PDS) for the peak over threshold (POT) analysis were derived. The monthly mean lake level is derived from three water level stations on the western shore of the lake at Chilumba (&#8722; 10.43&#176; S, 34.25&#176; E), Nkhata Bay (11.72&#176; S, 34.33&#176; E) and Monkey Bay (14.08&#176; S, 34.91&#176; E). These data were obtained from the Malawi Department of Water Resources, Surface Water Resources in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development, through the Climate Justice Water Futures Programme. The lake levels are presented in meters Above Shire Valley Datum (m ASVD), which is approximately equal to sea level (Drayton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1984</xref>). To account for the Lake Malawi level variation, the following parameters were used as covariates: (1) annual rainfall data for three stations located along the Lake Malawi shore, namely Karonga, Nkhata Bay, Nkhotakota, Salima, and Mangochi. These were obtained from the Watch Forcing data (WFD) (Weedon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2011</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2014</xref>). The WFD is a gridded data set at 0.5&#176; by 0.5&#176; (55 &#215; 55 km) grid boxes over the lake centered at these stations. These were aggregated into an aerial average by simple arithmetic average. There was no missing rainfall data from the WFD for the period: (2) depth of the mean annual discharge derived from 17 in flowing rivers into the lake on the Malawi part of the catchment as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No river flow data were available from the Tanzania and Mozambique parts of the catchment on the eastern lake shore, but it was assumed that the 17 inflowing rivers could ably represent all the inflows.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Some major flows (1 to 17) into Lake Malawi on the western shoreline and the only outflow (1)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Serial</th><th>River</th><th>Station</th><th>ID#</th><th>Lat (&#176;S)</th><th>Long (&#176;E)</th><th>Area (km<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Songwe</td><td>Mwandenga</td><td>9B7</td><td>&#8722; 9.59</td><td>33.77</td><td>2870</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Lufira</td><td>Ngerenge</td><td>9A2</td><td>&#8722; 9.81</td><td>33.84</td><td>1890</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Nrukuru</td><td>Mwakimeme</td><td>8A5</td><td>&#8722; 9.93</td><td>33.79</td><td>2091</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>North Rumphi</td><td>Chiweta</td><td>7H3</td><td>&#8722; 10.69</td><td>34.18</td><td>6,78</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>South Rukuru</td><td>Mlowe</td><td>7G18</td><td>&#8722; 10.75</td><td>34.21</td><td>12,027</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Lweya</td><td>Zayuka</td><td>16F2</td><td>&#8722; 11.78</td><td>34.20</td><td>2320</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Dwambadzi</td><td>Nthanda</td><td>16E6</td><td>&#8722; 12.24</td><td>33.98</td><td>1770</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Dwangwa</td><td>Rupashe</td><td>6D10</td><td>&#8722; 12.51</td><td>34.12</td><td>7768</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Bua</td><td>S3RoadBridge</td><td>5C1</td><td>&#8722; 12.79</td><td>34.20</td><td>10,659</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Chirua</td><td>Mtambe</td><td>15A4</td><td>&#8722; 13.46</td><td>34.24</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Lingadzi</td><td>Kaniche</td><td>15A8</td><td>&#8722; 13.54</td><td>34.24</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Linthipe</td><td>M5 Bridge</td><td>4B1</td><td>&#8722; 13.79</td><td>34.45</td><td>8180</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Nadzipulu</td><td>Mtakataka</td><td>3F3</td><td>&#8722; 14.21</td><td>34.51</td><td>224</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Namikokwe</td><td>Mua Mission</td><td>3E1</td><td>&#8722; 14.28</td><td>34.51</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Livulezi</td><td>Khwekhwerere</td><td>3E3</td><td>&#8722; 14.44</td><td>34.54</td><td>477</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Shire</td><td>Mangochi</td><td>1T1</td><td>&#8722; 14.48</td><td>35.27</td><td>126,500</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
