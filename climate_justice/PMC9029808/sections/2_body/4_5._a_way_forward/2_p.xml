As youth climate advocates, and researchers with direct experience and work in the climate space, we are well positioned to call upon governments to take and apply a holistic lens that integrates health and human rights perspectives in climate solutions. We offer three recommendations and strategies on how to move forward with climate solutions through holistic approaches, and provide new insights on how to pursue a resilient, equitable, and socially just future.</p>
