<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For selecting the best-fitting model, we estimated a series of GEEs by modifying the model specifications. We explored normal, gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions with log and identity link functions (six different specifications). An identity link function assumes the dependent variable is directly predicted and not transformed, while a log link function estimates the natural logarithm of the dependent variable. We selected the normal distribution with log link function for GEEs using UHRI as the dependent variable, and the normal distribution with an identity link function for GEEs using NDVI as the dependent variable. All independent variables were standardized before inclusion in the GEEs and standardized coefficients are presented in the table summarizing these models. The statistical significance of each individual variable coefficient was determined using two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-values from the Wald chi-square test. Finally, the multicollinearity condition index was calculated for the combination of independent variables included in each GEE. None of the models yielded a condition index higher than 5.0, indicating that these GEEs were not affected by multicollinearity. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26) software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).</p>
