It provides three analytical levels&#8212;niche innovations, socio-technical regimes, and socio-technical landscapes&#8212;with multiple subcomponents at each level in order to avoid path dependency (BAU scenario) for sustainability transitions; however, three analytical levels appear to be operational for local governance [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and lack operationalization on the LDPCs. Similarly, a socio-institutional approach to understanding the complex systematic needs for sustainability transitions also focuses on sectoral issues such as agriculture, industry, finance, business, education, or energy, and places limits on a particular geographical location [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; the scope of this study is beyond the available approaches in the literature. It includes various regions, including African, Asian, and Island countries.</p>
