<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 agreed to a visionary Programme of Action that was well ahead of its time. Women&#8217;s human rights advocates were the drivers of this paradigm shift, and since that time, have been the torch bearers of the ICPD Programme of Action. Together with supportive governments, allied social justice movements, and researchers, they have defended the ICPD agenda against well-funded attacks, advanced it at every opportunity including through its review conferences, creatively implemented it through innovation and community education, local organising and wide mobilisation, worked with governments, development agencies and other stakeholders, and held governments accountable.</p>
