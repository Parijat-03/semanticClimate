Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, <em><a href="#livelihood" class="mention">livelihoods</a></em>, health and <em><a href="#well-being" class="mention">well-being</a></em>, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including <em>ecosystem services</em>), <em><a href="#ecosystem" class="mention">ecosystems</a></em> and species.<br><br>In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related <em><a href="#hazard" class="mention">hazards</a></em> with the <em><a href="#exposure" class="mention">exposure</a></em> and <em><a href="#vulnerability" class="mention">vulnerability</a></em> of the affected human or ecological system to the hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and <em><a href="#likelihood" class="mention">likelihood</a></em> of occurrence, and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human decision-making (see also <em><a href="#risk_management" class="mention">risk management</a></em>, <em><a href="#adaptation" class="mention">adaptation</a></em>Â and <em><a href="#mitigation" class="mention">mitigation</a></em>).<br> <br> In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal objectives, such as the <em>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) </em>(see also<em><a href="#risk_trade-off" class="mention"> risk trade-off</a></em>). Risks can arise, for example, from uncertainty in implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of <em>climate policy</em>, climate-related investments, technology development or adoption, and system transitions.</p></div><div class="ms-2 p-1 small text-muted"><h6 class="mb-0">Sub-terms</h6><ul class="items mb-0"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Compound risks" data-phraseid="2110"><a href="compound_risks">Compound risks</a></span></li></ul></div></dd><div>
