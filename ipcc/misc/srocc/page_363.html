Climate change can exacerbate many degradation processes (Table&#160;4.1) and introduce novel ones (e.g.,&#160;permafrost thawing or biome shifts). To avoid, reduce or reverse degradation, land management activities can be selected to mitigate the impact of, and adapt to, climate change. In some cases, climate change impacts may result in increased productivity and carbon stocks, at least in the short term. For example, longer growing seasons due to climate warming can lead to higher forest productivity (Henttonen et al. 2017; Kauppi et al. 2014; Dragoni et al. 2011), but warming alone may not increase productivity where other factors such a&#160;water supply are limiting (Hember et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="519.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 519.59; y1: 529.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="519.59" x1="571.78">The types and intensity of human land-use and climate change impacts on lands affect their carbon stocks and their ability to operate as carbon sinks.
