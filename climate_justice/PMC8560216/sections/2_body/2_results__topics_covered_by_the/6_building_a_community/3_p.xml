The podcast continues to collaborate with speakers to raise awareness and funds. For example, due to the destructive 2020 California fires (e.g., Slater and Devil Fire 2020), the podcast promoted a fundraiser for the Karuk Tribe in northern California to purchase a fire truck (Karuk Tribe DNR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). The podcast has also given to other Black and Indigenous movements such as bailout funds for Black Lives Matter and also for the Lakota Land Defenders.</p>
