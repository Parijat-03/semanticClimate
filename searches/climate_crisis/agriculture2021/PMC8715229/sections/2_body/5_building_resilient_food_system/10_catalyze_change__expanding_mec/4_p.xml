<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0585">The multilateral system continues to lack enforcement capacities to effectively confront the global challenges of today and tomorrow. The multilateral system was already being undermined by growing geo-political tensions in recent years. 2020 was characterized by trade disputes and uncertain outlook on the international momentum to address to climate change. The pandemic reinforced some of these challenges, further underlining the need for leadership and international collaboration to effectively tackle global problems (<xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Sachs, 2020</xref>). While strong and effective international institutions are important, it remains to be seen to which extent and how quickly moves toward unilateral action can be reversed in 2021 to contain the spread of the pandemic, facilitate international vaccination efforts, and enable a broader socioeconomic recovery process. On the one hand the emergence of vaccination instilled hope in the combat against the pandemic, while the return of the United States in 2021 to the Paris Agreement may help to re-energize collective action toward more sustainable and resilient societies. The UN Food Systems Summit, and the 26th Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, and the CBD Summit establishing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework present a window of opportunity to advance integrated solutions to addressing development and environmental challenges in support of the SDGs. Yet assessments of current recovery funding shows that only a fraction of the resources is focused a green recovery (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">O'Callaghan and Murdock, 2021</xref>), illustrating the uncertainty underlying the direction of the recovery, i.e. whether societies will choose to &#8220;bounce forward&#8221; or prefer to &#8220;fall back&#8221; to business as usual.</p>
