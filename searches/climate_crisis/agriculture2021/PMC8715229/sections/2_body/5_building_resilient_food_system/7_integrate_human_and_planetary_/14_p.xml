<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0485">Target setting efforts not only require further ambition in terms of area protected as well specificity in terms of identifying conservation hotspots to guard against pandemic, climate, and/or other environmental risks. While area-based conservation targets are an important starting point, it also matters which areas and places are protected. Conservation efforts should take into account the potential to deliver multiple benefits. Recent research illustrates how conservation efforts can simultaneously target areas of high value for carbon storage and sequestration, a high level of biodiversity or of unique environmental quality such as species endemism, and relevance to other key ecosystem services (<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
