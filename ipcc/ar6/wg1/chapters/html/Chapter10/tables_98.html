      <td>The world is physically and culturally diverse, and the challenges posed by climate change vary by region and\nlocation. Because climate change affects so many aspects of people&#8217;s daily work and living, climate change\ninformation can help with decision-making, but only when the information is relevant for the people involved in\nmaking those decisions. Users of climate information may be highly diverse, ranging from professionals in areas\nsuch as human health, agriculture or water management to a broader community that experiences the impacts\nof changing climate. Providing information that supports response actions thus requires engaging all relevant\nstakeholders, their knowledge and their experiences, formulating appropriate information, and developing</td>

Effective partnerships recognize and respond to the\ndiversity of all parties involved (including their values, beliefs and interests), especially when they involve\nculturally diverse communities and their indigenous and local knowledge of weather, climate and their society.\nThis is particularly true for climate change &#8211; a global issue posing challenges that vary by region.

For example, climate scientists can provide information\non future changes by using simulations of global and/or regional climate and inferring changes in the weather\nbehaviour influencing a region. An effective distillation process (FAQ 10.1, Figure 1) engages with the intended\nrecipients of the information, especially stakeholders whose work involves non-climatic factors, such as human\nhealth, agriculture or water resources. The distillation evaluates the accuracy of all information sources\n(observations, simulations, expert judgement), weighs the credibility of possible conflicting information, and\narrives at climate information that includes estimating the confidence a user should have in it. Producers of\nclimate data should further recognize that the geographic regions and time periods governing stakeholders&#8217;\ninterest (for example, the growing season of an agricultural zone) may not align well with the time and space\nresolution of available climate data; thus additional model development or data processing may be required to</td>

Dialogue between stakeholders and climate scientists can determine the most\nrelevant experiences to evaluate for possible future behaviour. The development of storylines uses the experience\nand expertise of stakeholders, such as water-resource managers and health professionals, who seek to develop\nappropriate response measures. Storylines are thus a pathway through the distillation process that can make\nclimate information more accessible and physically comprehensible. For example, a storyline may take a common\nexperience like an extended drought, with depleted water availability and damaged crops, and show how\ndroughts may change in the future, perhaps with even greater precipitation deficits or longer duration. With\nappropriate choices, storylines can engage nuances of the climate information in a meaningful way by building</td>
