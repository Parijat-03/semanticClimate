These in turn are likely to affect livelihoods dependent on these sectors. Human health is another area of concern as some of the diseases are propagated by vectors that are climate dependent.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.75" top="633.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="633.72" x1="507.75" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 633.72; y1: 644.76; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">To address the climate change concerns the Government of India first defined its policy vis a vis climate change in June 2008 through a National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The eight missions covered in this action plan were considered with a view to design strategies for adaptation to climate change that would ensure and enhance ecological sustainability and explore solutions towards more efficient technologies. The Honourable Prime Minister had called upon the States to expeditiously prepare the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) which should be parallel to the strategy outlined in NAPCC. Translating national policies into action, especially at sub regional level, and decentralizing NAPCC objectives into local context is the greatest challenge. The preparation of State Level Action Plans is of great importance in this context. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.07" top="490.77"><span x0="72.02" y0="490.77" x1="508.07" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 490.77; y1: 501.81; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Observation shows that Delhi falls in the areas of greatest climatic variability, maximum vulnerability and lowest adaptive capacity. Already, water resources in the State are scarce and have a highly uneven distribution both temporally and spatially. A threat such as climate change thus calls for timely and coherent response and actions that will help reduce vulnerability and build resilience of the State to the likely climate impacts. Considering these impacts of Climate Change, Delhi Government has prepared SAPCC focussing on Transport, Urban Planning, Water, Forest and Biodiversity, Agriculture and Horticulture, Health, Energy, Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change Sectors. </span></div></body></html>
