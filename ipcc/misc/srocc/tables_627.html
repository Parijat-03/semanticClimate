Adaptation: There is no literature to assess the global impacts of enhanced mineral weathering on adaptation\n(Table 6.25) nor on desertification (Table 6.33). Land degradation: Limited benefits expected since ground minerals can\nincrease pH where acidification is the driver of degradation (Table 6.41; Taylor et al. 2016). Food security: Though there\nmay be co-benefits for food production (Beerling et al. 2018), these have not been quantified globally (Table 6.49).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits of large-scale bioenergy and BECCS by potential to remove large quantities of CO2 from the\natmosphere (Table 6.17). Adaptation: Limited adverse impacts of large-scale bioenergy and BECCS by increasing pres-\nsure on land (Table 6.25). Desertification: Up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2&#176;C scenarios,\nwhich will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation (Sections 6.3.3.1 and 6.3.4.1). This defines the maxi-\nmum area potentially impacted, though the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified. Land\ndegradation: Up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2&#176;C scenarios, which will increase pressure\nfor desertification and land degradation (Sections 6.3.3.1; 6.3.4.1). This defines the maximum area potentially impacted,\nthough the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified. Food security: Large adverse impacts\nof large-scale bioenergy and BECCS through increased competition for land for food (Table 6.49). These potentials and\neffects assume large areas of bioenergy crops, resulting in large mitigation potentials (i.e., &gt;3 GtCO2 yr&#8211;1). The sign and\nmagnitude of the effects of bioenergy and BECCS depends on the scale of deployment, the type of bioenergy feedstock,\nwhich other response options are included, and where bioenergy is grown (including prior land use and indirect land-use\nchange emissions). For example, limiting bioenergy production to marginal lands or abandoned cropland would have\nnegligible effects on biodiversity, food security, and potentially small co-benefits for land degradation; however, the\nbenefits for mitigation would also be smaller (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter, and Table 6.13).</td>
