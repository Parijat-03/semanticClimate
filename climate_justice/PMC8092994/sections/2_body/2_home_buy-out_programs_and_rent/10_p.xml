Contributing further to this disadvantage is the fact that property owners reliant on rental income, such as those with multi-family units, may be incentivized to decline the buy-out options. They then re-build or repair in the same (potentially increasingly) risky location, continuing to put renters at risk, often without their knowledge. The situation can become additionally complicated when the multi-unit dwelling is owner-occupied or has more than a few units. The cap on NFIP payouts can be inadequate for larger multi-unit dwellings and private flood insurance may be necessary to fully cover the repairs. Also, in an effort to optimize risk reduction, local flood managers with limited funds may prioritize multiple single-family homes that may be more affordable than higher-valued multi-family units. Renters who are aware of the risks may have access to flood insurance (FEMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020b</xref>), but the cost of that insurance is increased by factors over which a tenant has no control, such as the age of the building, the flood zone, and other measures owners can take to reduce flood risk. Current policies often do not provide incentives to landlords to address any of those factors that might make flood insurance more affordable for the tenant. To qualify for flood insurance, the property also must be located in a community covered by the NFIP (FEMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020a</xref>). If obtainable, however, such a policy would cover household belongings and could substantially assist the tenant in the event of a disaster.</p>
