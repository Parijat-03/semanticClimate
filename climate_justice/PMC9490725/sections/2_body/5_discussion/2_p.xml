These issues were defined by Sandel as the &#8220;fairness&#8221; and corruption&#8221; objections. Market norms suggest that we should just pay more for a negative activity rather than banning it. This approach not only does not work due to poor design that is fundamental to the system, but it crowds out non-market norms whereby it is not acceptable to pollute. This literature shows how MBMs in practice lead to unfair outcomes and the crowding out of non-market norms, and the analysis of the maritime case confirmed that this would also occur if MBMs were implemented. The novelty of the analysis was that it also provided evidence of both objections in the decade-long dominance of MBMs in the policy landscape. The fairness objection is seen in how policy is still based on efficiency rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels, and the corruption objection was evidenced by how MBMs have crowded out non-market policies, regardless of whether MBMs are even applied.</p>
