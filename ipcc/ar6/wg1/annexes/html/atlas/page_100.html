A significant increase in 5 snow accumulation of 5.2 &#177; 3.7% per decade from 1920 to 2011 was recorded by an ice core in western 6 Dronning Maud Land, near the Kohen station (Medley et al., 2018). The surface mass balance was found to 7 decrease significantly in eastern Dronning Maud Land and western Wilkes Land from 1957 to 2000 (Medley 8 and Thomas, 2019). The surface mass balance was found stable during the 1901&#8211;2000 period and the last 9 decades in the interior of the East Antarctic plateau (Thomas et al., 2017; Medley and Thomas, 2019), stable 10 over western Dronning Maud Land (Syowa-Dome F annual stake line, 1975&#8211;2006 period) (Wang et al., 11 2015), and stable in Adelie Land (annual stake line, 1971&#8211;2008 period) (Agosta et al., 2012). In the second 12 half of the 20th century, ice-shelf cores showed a negative trend of the surface mass balance but an increase 13 on the plateau in western Dronning Maud Land (Altnau et al., 2015). Regional trends of the last 50 years 14 (1961&#8211;2010) and 100 years (1911&#8211;2010) fall into centennial variability of the past 1,000 years, except for 15 coastal Dronning Maud Land (unusual 100-year increase in accumulation) and for coastal Victoria Land 16 (unusual 100-year decrease in accumulation) (Thomas et al., 2017). This contradicts some previous studies 17 which suggest a negligible change in the Antarctic surface mass balance, both over West and East 18 Antarctica, since 1957 (Monaghan et al., 2006) and that the current surface mass balance is not exceptionally 19 high compared to the past 800 years (Frezzotti et al., 2013; Medley and Thomas, 2019). 20 21 Queen Maud Land (East Antarctica) experienced extreme surface mass balance anomalies in 2009 and 2011, 22 unprecedented in the last 60 years (Lenaerts et al., 2013). These have been related to a handful of regionally 23 extreme anomalous snowfall events attributed to the large-scale atmospheric blocking directing intense 24 moisture flux within extra-tropical cyclones towards Antarctica (Gorodetskaya et al., 2014) and frequency of 25 such events in Antarctica has been increasing since 1979 (Turner et al., 2019; Wille et al., 2019). 26 27 As noted also in the SROCC Special Report (IPCC, 2019b), disentangling natural and human drivers of 28 atmospheric and ocean circulation changes which may influence the surface mass balance remains very 29 uncertain. The geographic pattern of accumulation changes since 1957 bears a strong imprint of a trend 30 towards more positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (e.g., Medley and Thomas, 2019). At the same 31 time, large-scale blocking and increased meridional moisture flow causing moist and warm air intrusions in 32 West Antarctica was found to be associated with a negative Southern Annular Mode (Scott et al., 2019). 33 There is some recent limited evidence from modelling, observations and reanalyses that increased Antarctic 34 precipitation might have mitigated dynamical ice-mass losses by about 50 Gt yr</span><span x0="407.7" y0="348.06" x1="413.49" style="x0: 407.7; x1: 410.04; y0: 348.06; y1: 355.08; width: 2.34; font-size: 7.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">-1</span><span x0="416.22" y0="342.71" x1="41.44" style="x0: 416.22; x1: 420.49; y0: 342.71; y1: 353.69; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">since about 1990 (Lenaerts 35 et al., 2018; Medley and Thomas, 2019) and at lower rates over the entire 20th century (Medley and Thomas, 36 2019). The cause of this possible increase, which could be circulation changes linked to ozone depletion 37 (Lenaerts et al., 2018) or large-scale warming (Frieler et al., 2015; Medley and Thomas, 2019), is unclear &#8211; 38 see the SROCC Special Report (IPCC, 2019b) for a more detailed discussion of attribution and its 39 uncertainties. 40 41 42 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 241.49; y1: 252.47; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="241.49" x1="273.31">Atlas.5.9.1.3 Assessment of model performance </span><span x0="27.66" y0="241.49" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 241.49; y1: 252.47; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">43 Because Antarctica is an exceptionally data-sparse region, regional and local surface mass balance and 44 climate information for the present day from relatively coarse general circulation models (GCMs) or high-45 resolution regional climate models (RCMs) are needed. Fewer than 10 out of 41 CMIP5 GCMs have 46 reasonable biases when compared to ERA-Interim reanalysis with simulated present-day temperature 47 increases highly sensitive to Southern Ocean sea-ice biases in the models (Agosta et al., 2015; Bracegirdle et 48 al., 2015). 49 50 Comparison of CMIP5 models with Cloudsat satellite products and ERA-Interim reanalyses showed that 51 almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 100% (Palerme et al., 52 2017), hence resulting in large biases in the surface mass balance. GCM simulations of surface snow-melt 53 processes are of variable quality, with the processes represented extremely simply in the models or even non-54 existent (Agosta et al., 2015; Trusel et al., 2015). This is not overly important for current climate simulations 55 </span></div></body></html>
