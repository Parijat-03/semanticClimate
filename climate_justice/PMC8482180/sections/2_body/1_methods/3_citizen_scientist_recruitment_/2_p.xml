Community members aged 13 years and older are invited to participate in the project as citizen scientists. Citizen scientists can actively engage in the research process from data collection to knowledge translation [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Citizen scientists determine their level of participation, but unlike traditional research projects, they can contribute to cocreating project objectives as community needs change. This participatory approach ensures that citizens are not passively providing data and can instead engage with researchers and decision makers to shape solutions or outcomes of interest. For example, citizens can anonymously and directly communicate information about a community emergency with decision makers through a front-end mobile app via a user-triggered messaging system. Citizen science also plays an important role in facilitating self-determination and self-governance, as citizens are stewards of their own data and decision-making in the community.</p>
