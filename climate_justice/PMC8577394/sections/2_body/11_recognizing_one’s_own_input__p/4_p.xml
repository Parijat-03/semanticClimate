I really do. [&#8230;] In fact, I was trying to get people to disrupt meetings because I thought the city was giving really lame excuses of why the benches had to be like park benches from the 1964 New York World&#8217;s Fair and lighting that had to look like that instead of Brooklyn Bridge Park or the backend in Governor&#8217;s Island, and people just went along with it.&#8221; Paula recounted that the plan was uncontroversial, and that when residents now talk about the old plan, they call it the &#8220;consensus plan.&#8221;</p>
