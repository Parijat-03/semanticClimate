Banda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>) rightly reconceptualizes adaptation as a multi-level PG, with domestic, transboundary, and global dimensions; he also explores the implications of this conceptual shift, proposing a multi-level governance model that could help produce what he calls &#8220;optimal adaptation.&#8221; Seo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2013</xref>) argues for &#8220;smart adaptation&#8221; that can contribute to both adaptation and mitigation, as shared GPGs. Such a reconceptualization will sensitize the global community, facilitating to overcome the perennial risk of underprovision of GPGs, like adaptation. This expansive understanding by Kaul et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>:185) is based on a multi-disciplinary framing, drawing from (1) theories of public goods, (2) theories of market failure, (3) theories of basic needs, and (4) political economy.</p>
