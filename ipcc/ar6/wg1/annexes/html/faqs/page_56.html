Based on models and theory, scientific studies indicate that, while the AMOC is expected to slow in a&#160;warming climate, the Gulf Stream will not change much and would not shut down totally, even if the AMOC did. Most climate models project that the AMOC slows in the later 21st&#160;century under most emissions scenarios, with some models showing it slowing even sooner. The&#160;Gulf Stream affects the weather and sea level, so if it slows, North America will see higher sea levels and Europe&#8217;s weather and rate of relative warming will be affected.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.86" top="573.97"><span x0="69.02" y0="573.97" x1="539.86" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 573.97; y1: 582.97; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The Gulf Stream is the biggest current in the North Atlantic Ocean. It transports about 30 billion kilograms of water per second northward past points on the east coast of North America. It is a&#160;warm current, with temperatures 5&#176;C to 15&#176;C warmer than surrounding waters, so it carries warmer water (thermal energy) from its southern origins and releases warmth to the atmosphere and surrounding water.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.79" top="519.98"><span x0="69.02" y0="519.98" x1="539.79" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 519.98; y1: 528.98; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The Gulf Stream is part of two major circulation patterns, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (FAQ 9.3, Figure&#160;1). The rotation of the Earth causes the big currents in both circulations to stay on the western side of their basin, which in the Atlantic means the circulations combine to form the Gulf Stream. Other large currents contribute to gyres, such as the Kuroshio in the North Pacific and the East Australian Current in the South Pacific, but the Gulf Stream is special in its dual role. There is no comparable deep overturning circulation in the North Pacific to the AMOC, so the Kuroshio plays only one role as part of a&#160;gyre.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.78" top="430.0"><span x0="69.02" y0="430.0" x1="539.78" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 430.0; y1: 439.0; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The gyres circulate surface waters and result primarily from winds driving the circulation. These winds are not expected to change much and so neither will the gyres, which means the gyre portion of the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio will continue to transport thermal energy poleward from the equator much as they do now. The gyre contribution to the Gulf Stream is 2 to 10 times larger than the AMOC contribution.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.84" top="376.01"><span x0="69.02" y0="376.01" x1="539.84" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 376.01; y1: 385.01; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The Gulf Stream&#8217;s role in the AMOC is supplying surface source water that cools, becomes denser and sinks to form cold, deep waters that travel back equatorward, spilling over features on the ocean floor and mixing with other deep Atlantic waters to form a&#160;southward current at a&#160;depth of about 1500 metres beneath the Gulf Stream. This overturning flow is the AMOC, with the Gulf Stream in the upper kilometre flowing northward, and&#160;the colder deep water flowing southward.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.79" top="310.02"><span x0="69.02" y0="310.02" x1="539.79" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 310.02; y1: 319.02; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The AMOC is expected to slow over the coming centuries. One reason why is freshening of the ocean waters: by meltwater from Greenland, changing Arctic sea ice, and increased precipitation over warmer northern seas. An array of moorings across the Atlantic has been monitoring the AMOC since 2004, with recently expanded capabilities. The monitoring of the AMOC has not been long enough for a&#160;trend to emerge from variability and detect long-term changes that may be underway (see FAQ 1.2). Other indirect signs may indicate slowing overturning&#160;&#8211; for example, slower warming where the Gulf Stream&#8217;s surface waters sink. Climate models show that this &#8216;cold spot&#8217; of slower-than-average warming occurs as the AMOC weakens, and they project that this will continue. Paleoclimate evidence indicates that the AMOC changed significantly in the past, especially during transitions from colder climates to warmer ones, but that it has been stable for 8000 years.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="196.05"><span x0="69.02" y0="196.05" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 196.05; y1: 205.05; width: 9.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">What happens if the AMOC slows in a&#160;warming world? The atmosphere adjusts somewhat by carrying more heat, compensating partly for the decreases in heat carried by AMOC. But the &#8216;cold spot&#8217; makes parts of Europe warm more slowly. Models indicate that weather patterns in Greenland and around the Atlantic will be affected, with reduced precipitation in the mid-latitudes, changing strong precipitation patterns in the tropics and Europe, and stronger storms in the North Atlantic storm track. The slowing of this current combined with the rotation of the Earth means that sea level along North America rises as the AMOC contribution to the Gulf Stream slows.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.79" top="118.06"><span x0="69.02" y0="118.06" x1="539.79" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 118.06; y1: 127.06; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The North Atlantic is not the only site of sensitive meridional overturning. Around Antarctica, the world&#8217;s densest seawater is formed by freezing into sea ice, leaving behind salty, cold water that sinks to the bottom and spreads northward. Recent studies show that melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and changing winds over the Southern Ocean can affect this southern meridional overturning, affecting regional weather.</span></div></body></html>
