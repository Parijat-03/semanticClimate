They are partly that; but far more than that, pro-extractive injunctions here have been predicated on moving to a different terrain &#8211; that of a political space of exception beyond &#8216;normal&#8217; law, where rights can be suspended and new, tailor-made &#8216;justice&#8217; can be fashioned to the judicial preferences of politically-appointed judges, who take on their own troubling interpretations in defending their very own injunction orders. In this exceptional space, a &#8216;new normal&#8217;<xref rid="fn13" ref-type="fn">13</xref>
is created for the purposes of criminalising Indigenous and non-Indigenous resistance alike and &#8220;easing the operation of extractive capitalism&#8221; (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ceric, 2020</xref>). In this new normal, past precedents that have to do with necessity defences or Indigenous rights are deemed irrelevant and the only &#8216;irreparable harm&#8217; that is pertinent is harm to corporate profits and the hegemonic &#8216;order&#8217; it seeks.</p>
