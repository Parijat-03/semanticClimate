However, it suffered challenges from both the developed and developing world. With Xi Jinping&#8217;s accession to power, China&#8217;s international identity construction has been transforming towards a Yinling Leading Power. In the Paris era and beyond, China has reconstructed issues of climate justice and climate governance has become an important platform where China seeks to represent itself as a &#8216;<italic>yinlingzhe</italic>&#8217; (leading state) and share leadership with other major powers. China&#8217;s embrace of a shared leadership is similar to the EU&#8217;s new interactive way to wielding climate leadership since Paris. China&#8217;s climate leadership constitutes its new identity construction and becomes a key feature. China&#8217;s transformation has far-reaching implications for strengthening global climate justice and promoting global climate governance. This article also points out that China&#8217;s inadequate response to international expectations and lack of self-reflection in its climate policy have influenced international recognition on its climate leadership and new identity. In the post-Paris era, whether or not China fulfills its climate commitments, takes the lead in promoting global climate cooperation and gains sufficient recognition from other parties will have profound consequences for the prospects of this new identity construction, which has not yet been stabilized and secured.</p>
