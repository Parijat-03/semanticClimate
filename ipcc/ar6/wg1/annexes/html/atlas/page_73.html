The observed 3 temperature anomalies showed an increase in intensity and in frequency of heatwave events in an area 4 covering most of South America between 1980 and 2014 (Ceccherini et al., 2016) (see Chapter11). 5 Conversely, there has been no significant change for cold waves. Also, the trend of the difference between 6 the annual mean of the daily maximum temperature and the annual mean of the daily minimum temperature 7 was positive &#8211; up to 1&#176;C per decade &#8211; over the extratropics with the maximum temperature generally 8 increasing faster than the minimum temperature, while a negative trend &#8211; up to &#8211;0.5&#176;C per decade &#8211; was 9 observed over the tropics. 10 11 Regionally, analyses of temperatures point to an increased warming trend (</span><span style="x0: 386.94; x1: 392.43; y0: 633.65; y1: 644.63; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="386.94" y0="633.65" x1="456.86">high confidence</span><span x0="456.84" y0="633.65" x1="41.44" style="x0: 456.84; x1: 460.49; y0: 633.65; y1: 644.63; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">) over Amazonia 12 over the last 40 years, which reached approximately 0.6&#176;C&#8211;0.7&#176;C (Figure Atlas.39:a) and with stronger 13 warming during the dry season and over the southeast. The analyses also showed that 2016 was the warmest 14 year since at least 1950 (Marengo et al., 2018). In many areas in Brazil the frequency and length of 15 heatwaves has increased over the last five decades (Bitencourt et al., 2016) (see Chapter 11). Trends for 16 temperature extremes are also positive over most of Argentina during the recent decades (Barros et al., 2015) 17 (Figure Atlas.38:). In central Argentina, the trends of temperature extremes show warming in several months 18 with clear increases in heatwaves. However, in other parts of the country, combinations of different trends 19 and decadal variability resulted in some cases in a decrease of extreme heatwaves (Rusticucci et al., 2016). 20 In addition, analysis of the Hadley Centre extremes dataset, HadEX2 (Donat et al., 2013), showed a decrease 21 in the annual maximum of daily maximum temperature values over south-eastern South America (SES) in 22 the second half of the 20th century mostly caused by stratospheric ozone depletion over the South Pole (Wu 23 and Polvani, 2017). Andean temperatures showed significant warming trends, especially at inland and higher 24 elevation sites, while trends are non-significant or negative at coastal sites (Vuille et al., 2015; Burger et al., 25 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018). The analysis over central Chile also showed that the positive trends are 26 largely restricted to austral spring, summer and autumn seasons for mean, maximum and minimum 27 temperatures (Burger et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018). Over Peru maximum air temperature trends 28 mainly amplified during the austral summer, but cold season minimum air temperature trends showed an 29 opposite pattern, with the strongest warming being recorded in the austral winter (Vicente-Serrano et al., 30 2018).  31 32 In general, the spatial patterns of observed trends in temperature are more consistent than for precipitation 33 across the whole South America as can be seen in Figure Atlas.38: where the trends in annual precipitation 34 totals are shown. However, significant changes in the spatial and temporal rainfall variability were observed 35 over South America in recent decades, although subject to observational uncertainty (de Barros Soares et al., 36 2017a) (</span><span style="x0: 93.72; x1: 101.64; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="93.72" y0="317.45" x1="178.88">medium confidence</span><span x0="178.86" y0="317.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 178.86; x1: 182.51; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). In southeast Brazil there is a region of highly significant decrease of rainfall in 37 both wet and dry seasons recorded in the period 1979&#8211;2011 (Rao et al., 2016). In contrast, southern South 38 America has experienced significant increase of the annual precipitation since the beginning of the 20th 39 century, mostly explained by positive trends in austral summer (Saurral et al., 2017). In eastern Argentina, 40 southern Brazil and western Uruguay, a positive significant increase of total annual precipitation and 41 intensity of rainfall events has been observed (Figure Atlas.38:) (Scian and Pierini, 2013; Barros et al., 2015; 42 Cavalcanti et al., 2015; Hannart et al., 2015a; Vera and D&#237;az, 2015; Wu and Polvani, 2017) from the late 43 1960s which increase the probability of extreme flows over the main rivers of the Plata Basin. An increase in 44 precipitation in eastern Patagonia and a marked decrease in rainfall in Chile was also found in agreement 45 with the trends in annual precipitation totals (Vera and D&#237;az, 2015) displayed in Figure Atlas.38:. 46 47 The Amazon biome is perhaps the most-studied in South America due to the important role it plays in the 48 global energy balance, hydrological cycle and carbon balance. The Amazon Basin has experienced more 49 frequent floods and droughts over the past two decades (Espinoza et al., 2013; Gloor et al., 2015; Marengo 50 and Espinoza, 2016). Observational studies also show that the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has 51 increased significantly since 1979, and accompanied by a prolonged fire season (Fu et al., 2013; Alves, 52 2016). On the other hand, recent analyses of Amazon hydrological and precipitation data suggest an 53 intensification of the hydrological cycle over the past few decades (Gloor et al., 2015). In general, these 54 changes are attributed mainly to decadal climate fluctuations (</span><span style="x0: 330.36; x1: 335.85; y0: 89.75; y1: 100.73; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="330.36" y0="89.75" x1="400.22">high confidence</span><span x0="400.26" y0="89.75" x1="41.45" style="x0: 400.26; x1: 403.92; y0: 89.75; y1: 100.73; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">), El Ni&#241;o-Southern 55 </span></div></body></html>
