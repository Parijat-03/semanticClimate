The sources of their influence include monopoly control of electricity distribution, unparalleled technical expertise, their lobbying force, and flexible corporate organization (Basseches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). The latter has facilitated mergers and acquisitions that have allowed utility parent companies to operate across state lines, despite being mainly regulated at the state level (Hempling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>; Prechel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">b</xref>).</p>
