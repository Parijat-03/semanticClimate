Communities in the upper quartile of vulnerability under CES received 82.4% of heat-related CCI-funded tract interventions. Communities similarly vulnerable under HHAI, the heat specific index produced by the state, received only 65.3% of heat-related tract interventions. Of the interventions in HHAI-vulnerable tracts, the vast majority went to communities designated as vulnerable under both indices; only 8.7% of HHAI interventions went to communities that were vulnerable under HHAI but not CES. Conversely, 27.7% of the 2,063 heat-related adaptations in CES-vulnerable communities went to tracts vulnerable under CES but not HHAI. 1,279 interventions went to tracts vulnerable under all three of the indices. Although the discrepancy between HHAI and CES persisted across all CCI-funded interventions, it is less pronounced. 25.3% and 30.8% of tract interventions went to communities vulnerable under HHAI and CES, respectively. Tracts that are vulnerable under CES but not HHAI received 4.0 times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under HHAI but not CES. This number shrinks to 1.8 when considering all CCI interventions implemented by the state.</p>
