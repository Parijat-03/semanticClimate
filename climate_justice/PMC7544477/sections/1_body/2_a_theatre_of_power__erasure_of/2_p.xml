<disp-quote><p><italic>&#8220;It is ironic that civil disobedience seems only acceptable when it lies comfortably in the past. In 1946, Viola Desmond was prosecuted for challenging racial segregation in Nova Scotia by refusing to leave a whites-only area of a movie cinema. That incident propelled the civil rights movement in Canada. In 2010, Ms. Desmond was granted the first posthumous pardon in Canada and the government of Nova Scotia apologized for prosecuting her. Later, in 2018, Canada acknowledged that the real and greater crime was the existence of racial segregation in Nova Scotia. It did this by placing Ms. Desmond's image on our current $10 bill &#8211; but this did not occur until 71 years after her act of civil disobedience. The consensus of climate scientists is that we do not have that kind of time with climate change.</italic></p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>Viola Desmond broke the law. It may not have been government policy, but segregation in Canada was legal. Slavery was legal. The genocide of indigenous peoples, the theft of their lands, the brutality of residential schools were all within the law &#8230; I would like to close by acknowledging that we are here on the traditional unceded territory of the Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh peoples. They have much to teach us about respect for the earth, and our need to live in harmony with the ecosphere as a matter of survival. I believe it is time for us to listen to them.&#8221;</italic></p><attrib>- Statements to the BC Supreme Court before sentencing - by Will Offley (arrested pipeline protestor), Vancouver, 2018</attrib></disp-quote>
