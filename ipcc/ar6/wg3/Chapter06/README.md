## What is semanticClimate? 
semanticClimate is a project which aims to convert climate related documents by the IPCC to a semantic form, understood by both humans and computers. 

## Why are such conversions required? 
The goal is to extract useful information from the IPCC documents so that  relevant information could be made accessible for everyone to read and understand.

## What is IPCC? 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations which is responsible for advancing knowledge on human-induced climate change. The IPCC provides a scientific, comprehensive and objective information on climate change due to anthropogenic factoc as well as the possible response options. The IPCC undertakes periodic and systematic reviews of all published literature and with the help of the global scientific community reviews it making it the biggest peer review process. This review is then compiled into Assessment Reports. These reports are important for policymakers and the general public.
