[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] argued that it can be difficult for companies to obtain data from upstream and downstream actors (e.g., suppliers and customers), in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standard that SBTi refers companies to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and that the different emission estimation methods allowed by the standard can lead to very different estimates. Scope 3 accounting issue have also been addressed by other scholars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and pose challenges for tracking progress against SBTs. For example, a company changing the method used to estimate (parts of) its scope 3 emissions can obfuscate whether an apparent emission decrease (or increase) is genuine or a model artifact. Changes to the scope 3 standard are likely needed to address some of these issues.</p>
