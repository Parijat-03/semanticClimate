Proxies of dynamics include spatial and temporal turnover of species and habitats within ecosystems (Ghazoul et al. 2015; Bahamondez and Thompson 2016). Indicators in agricultural lands include crop yield decreases and dif&#64257;culty in maintaining yields (Stocking et al. 2001). Indicators of landscape degradation/improvement in fragmented forest landscapes include the extent, size and distribution of remaining forest fragments, an increase in edge habitat, and loss of connectivity and ecological memory (Zahawi et al. 2015; Pardini et al. 2010). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="579.54" x1="312.98">In summary, as land degradation is such a&#160;complex and global process, there is no single method by which land degradation can be estimated objectively and consistently over large areas (</span><span style="x0: 277.62; x1: 281.67; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="277.62" y0="555.55" x1="312.98">very high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 103.8; x1: 106.44; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="103.8" y0="543.55" x1="312.99">).

The reasons are both conceptual&#160;&#8211; that is, how land degradation is de&#64257;ned, using what baseline (Herrick et al. 2019) or over what time period&#160;&#8211; and methodological&#160;&#8211; that is, how it can be measured (Prince et al. 2018). Although there is a&#160;strong consensus that land degradation is a&#160;reduction in productivity of the land or soil, there are diverging views regarding the spatial and temporal scales at which land degradation occurs (Warren 2002), and how this can be quanti&#64257;ed and mapped. Proceeding from the de&#64257;nition in this report, there are also diverging views concerning ecological integrity and the value to humans. A&#160;comprehensive treatment of the conceptual discussion about land degradation is provided by the recent report on land degradation from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (Montanarella et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.44" top="735.54"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 735.54; y1: 745.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.54" x1="571.44">A review of different attempts to map global land degradation, based on expert opinion, satellite observations, biophysical models and a&#160;database of abandoned agricultural lands, suggested that between &lt;10&#160;Mkm</span><span style="x0: 358.77; x1: 361.96; y0: 703.43; y1: 710.08; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="358.77" y0="703.43" x1="361.96">2</span><span style="x0: 364.01; x1: 366.82; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="364.01" y0="699.52" x1="403.09">to 60&#160;Mkm</span><span style="x0: 403.08; x1: 406.28; y0: 703.43; y1: 710.08; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="403.08" y0="703.43" x1="406.28">2</span><span style="x0: 408.33; x1: 410.97; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="408.33" y0="699.52" x1="571.5">(corresponding to&#160;8&#8211;45% of the ice-free land area) have been degraded globally (Gibbs and Salmon, 2015) (</span><span style="x0: 554.26; x1: 558.3; y0: 687.53; y1: 697.03; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="554.26" y0="687.53" x1="571.48">very low con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 377.79; x1: 380.43; y0: 675.53; y1: 685.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="377.79" y0="675.53" x1="384.64">). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.47" top="651.53"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 329.25; y0: 651.53; y1: 661.03; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="651.53" x1="571.47">One often-used global assessment of land degradation uses trends in NDVI as a&#160;proxy for land degradation and improvement during the period 1983 to 2006 (Bai et al. 2008b,c) with an update to 2011 (Bai et al. 2015). These studies, based on very coarse resolution satellite data (NOAA AVHRR data with a&#160;resolution of 8&#160;km), indicated that, between 22% and 24% of the global ice-free land area was subject to a&#160;downward trend, while about 16% showed an increasing trend. The study also suggested, contrary to earlier assessments (Middleton and Thomas 1997), that drylands were not among the most affected regions. Another study using a&#160;similar approach for the period 1981&#8211;2006 suggested that about 29% of the global land area is subject to &#8216;land degradation hotspots&#8217;, that is, areas with acute land degradation in need of particular attention. These hotspot areas were distributed over all agro-ecological regions and land cover types. Two different studies have tried to link land degradation, identi&#64257;ed by NDVI as a&#160;proxy, and number of people affected: Le et al. (2016) estimated that at least&#160;3.2&#160;billion people were affected, while Barbier and Hochard (2016, 2018) estimated that&#160;1.33&#160;billion people were affected, of which 95% were living in developing countries. </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.48" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.36; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 4.92; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="411.56" x1="571.48">Yet another study, using a&#160;similar approach and type of remote-sensing data, compared NDVI trends with biomass trends calculated by a&#160;global vegetation model over the period 1982&#8211;2010 and found that 17&#8211;36% of the land areas showed a&#160;negative NDVI trend, while a&#160;positive or neutral trend was predicted in modelled vegetation (Schut et al. 2015). The World Atlas of Deserti&#64257;cation (3rd edition) includes a&#160;global map of land productivity change over the period 1999 to 2013, which is one useful proxy for land degradation (Cherlet et al. 2018). Over that period, about 20% of the global ice-free land area shows signs of declining or unstable productivity, whereas about 20% shows increasing productivity. The same report also summarised the productivity trends by land categories and found that most forest land showed increasing trends in productivity, while rangelands had more declining trends than increasing trends (Figure&#160;4.4). These productivity assessments, however, do not distinguish between trends due to climate change and trends due to other factors. A&#160;recent analysis of &#8216;greening&#8217; of the world using MODIS time series of NDVI 2000&#8211;2017, shows a&#160;striking increase in the greening over China and India. In China the greening is seen over forested areas, 42%, and cropland areas, in which 32% is increasing (Section&#160;4.9.3). In India, the greening is almost entirely associated with cropland (82%) (Chen et al. 2019). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.48" top="135.6"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.89; y0: 135.6; y1: 145.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="135.6" x1="571.48">All these studies of vegetation trends show that there are regionally differentiated trends of either decreasing or increasing vegetation. When comparing vegetation trends with trends in climatic variables, Schut et al. (2015) found very few areas (1&#8211;2%) where an increase in vegetation trend was independent of the climate drivers, and that study suggested that positive vegetation trends are primarily caused by climatic factors. </span></div></body></html>
