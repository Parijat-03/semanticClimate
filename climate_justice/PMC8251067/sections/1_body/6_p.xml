<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To demand that fossil fuels be abandoned without simultaneously demanding substantial economic degrowth is to assume that the fossil energy currently sustaining modern civilisation can be replaced with other energy sources. Although this assumption is widely promoted, it is highly dubious.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="soca13000-note-1002">2</xref> Given the modest progress of capitalist and socialist nations alike in struggling to decarbonise, and given the unlikelihood of a <italic>global</italic> hegemony of the fossil fuels lobby, we must infer structural constraints operating through the financial or spatial requirements of alternative energy technologies (Hornborg et al. <xref rid="soca13000-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). To the extent that it does not acknowledge these constraints, for instance by explicitly advocating degrowth, the climate movement risks posing demands that are simply dismissed by mainstream politicians as incompatible with the energy requirements of modern civilisation. Many people will wonder what the implications of its demands would be for their lifestyles. While the curtailing of personal mobility is obvious, it is legitimate to ask how the globalised trade in foodstuffs and other commodities can be upheld in the absence of fossil fuels. The climate activists will need to explain how they would reorganise the production and transport of food and other necessities. The climate movement has excelled in <italic>communicating</italic> our growing anxiety about climate change but needs to elaborate its programme for dismantling our fossil infrastructure.</p>
