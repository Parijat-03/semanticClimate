Rice is the country's staple food, and the chief rice production system (exclusive to West Africa) is practiced in saline soils formerly covered by mangrove forests. Mangrove swamp rice production (<italic>bolanha salgada</italic> in Creole) depends upon the cutting down of the trees, the construction of dikes (and sometimes dams<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>), the division of the reclaimed land into parcels through the construction of secondary dikes, and the installation of ducts and dischargers in the dikes to allow water management (e.g., Linares, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1992</xref>; Cormier-Salem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Temudo &amp; Cabral, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>). Each parcel is plowed manually with a long-handled wooden shovel tipped with an iron edge. Both canals and ridges play an important part in water management, weed control, feeding the rice plants with rainwater, and leaching salt and acids from the soil. Additionally, in the surrounding creeks (and in the canals), women use several kinds of nets and traps to collect small fish, shrimps, and crabs. Many men fish in the creeks and sea arms surrounding the rice fields using canoes and large nets. For coastal people, fish is the main daily source of protein and an essential source of cash income.</p>
