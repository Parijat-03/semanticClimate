This coalition reaches across Canadian museum workers and organizations and illustrates the kind of work that is being done externally&#8212;across institutions&#8212;for socio-eco justice and transformative practices. Among its guiding principles, it is argued that the Coalition should serve &#8220;as a trustworthy broker to facilitate healthy and respectful dialogue among different points of view on issues confronting museums and their communities as they address climate change&#8221; (Coalition of Museums for Climate Justice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">n.d.</xref>, para. 6).</p>
