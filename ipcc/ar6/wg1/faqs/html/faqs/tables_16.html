The second is large volcanic eruptions, which increase the number of small particles (aerosols)\nin the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight and cool the surface&#8211;an effect that can last for several years\n(see also FAQ 3.2). The main human drivers of climate change are increases in the atmospheric concentrations\nof greenhouse gases and of aerosols from burning fossil fuels, land use and other sources. The greenhouse\ngases trap infrared radiation near the surface, warming the climate. Aerosols, like those produced naturally\nby volcanoes, on average cool the climate by increasing the reflection of sunlight. Multiple lines of evidence</td>

These climate models show a dominant warming effect of\ngreenhouse gas increases (red band, which shows the warming effects of greenhouse gases by themselves),\nwhich has been partly offset by the cooling effect of increases in atmospheric aerosols (blue band). By contrast,\nsimulations that include only natural processes, including internal variability related to El Ni&#241;o and other similar\nvariations, as well as variations in the activity of the sun and emissions from large volcanoes (green band in\nFAQ 3.1, Figure 1), are not able to reproduce the observed warming. The fact that simulations including only\nnatural processes show much smaller temperature increases indicates that natural processes alone cannot explain\nthe strong rate of warming observed.
