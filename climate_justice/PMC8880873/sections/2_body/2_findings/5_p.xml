Creating utility-scale wind power facilities requires Native Nations to have substantial business acumen and administrative capacity to negotiate with non-tribal companies. Casinos provide this sort of experience to tribal governments, especially when they operate on a large scale, often alongside hotel facilities. More broadly, scholars note that the casino industry tends to positively affect economic growth in both tribal and non-tribal areas [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261752.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Hence, for the purpose of this paper, casino square footage serves as a theoretically persuasive proxy for the business and administrative competence of the tribal government. Across our models, casino size (logged) has a positive, statistically significant association with wind installed capacity.</p>
