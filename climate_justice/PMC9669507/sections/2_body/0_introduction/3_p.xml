<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This research aims to understand the impact of predictive journalism on audiences by
qualitatively analyzing the comments section of a sample of such news articles from
three US-based news outlets: The New York Times, The Washington Post, and
FiveThirtyEight. The digital medium of predictive journalism combined with the
deliberate and thoughtful engagement from readers via online comments offers a
unique opportunity to understand how people respond to predictive models and
forecasts in news media (<xref rid="bibr19-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Hullman et al., 2015</xref>). Because comments are generally unsolicited and
reflect readers&#8217; raw reactions to news content, they provide a rich and ecologically
valid window into how <italic toggle="yes">some</italic> people in the audience are responding to
the predictions. In this work, we analyze 885 comments made in response to six
articles, applying an iterative qualitative thematic analysis approach to uncover
patterns and themes in user reactions.</p>
