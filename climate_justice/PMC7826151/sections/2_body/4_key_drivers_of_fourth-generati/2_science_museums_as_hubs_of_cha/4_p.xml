The first is <italic>Ngoda: The Wealth Beneath our Feet</italic> (Mutare Museum, Zimbabwe). This exhibit with its original focus on the illegal diamond trade and the accounts of villagers removed from extractions zones, translated to becoming a forum for public dialogue (Chipangura, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). Due to its contents, the exhibit quickly moved into controversial territory, leading to public discussions between government officials and the community. In so doing, this bold exhibition led to social change and some social justice for displaced families, and contributed to the reframing of the museum&#8217;s and the villagers&#8217; communities&#8217; identities. The second exhibition to consider is <italic>Race: Are we so different</italic>? (Science Museum of Minnesota, U.S.A.). According to the Museum&#8217;s website (Science Museum of Minnesota, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">n.d.</xref>), the exhibition: &#8220;helps visitors understand what race is and what it is not. It gives them the tools to recognize racial ideas and practices in contemporary American life&#8221; (para 4).</p>
