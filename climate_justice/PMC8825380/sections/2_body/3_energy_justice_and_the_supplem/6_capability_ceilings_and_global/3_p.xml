Nussbaum considers an example that is similar by way of principle when she writes, &#8216;There are very likely other costs not associated with fundamental entitlements that could be trimmed way back before we would have to cut anyone&#8217;s health care [&#8230;] surely support for luxury items would be our first target&#8217; (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 403).</p>
