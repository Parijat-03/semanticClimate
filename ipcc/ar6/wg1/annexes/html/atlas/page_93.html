There have been a number of 10 experiments using CPMs over North America (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2014; Prein et al., 2015, 2019; Liu et 11 al., 2017a; Komurcu Bayraktar et al., 2018). Prein et al. (2017a) used a CPM over North America to 12 investigate changes in Mesoscale Convective Systems by the end of the century and found that their 13 frequency more than triples by the end of the century, assuming an RCP8.5 scenario, with up to an 80% 14 increase in associated total precipitation volume. Komurcu Bayraktar et al. (2018) used multiple nesting of 15 WRF over the north-eastern US to downscale the CESM to 3 km and investigated the downscaling effect on 16 a future scenario (RCP8.5) and found a different pattern of precipitation change in the CESM (increases 17 every month) and in WRF (mixed increases and decreases). It is clear from these investigations that very 18 high-resolution simulations add important dimensions to our understanding of regional climate change, 19 although they do not necessarily lead to reduced uncertainty.  20 21 The development of ensembles of initial conditions of global models affords the opportunity to investigate 22 the effects of such ensembles in a regional modelling context particularly regarding extremes and natural 23 variability (Fan et al., 2014; Leduc et al., 2019). Leduc et al. (2019) produced a 50-member ensemble with 24 the Canadian Regional Model (CRCM5) at 12 km resolution driven by the CanESM2 50-member initial 25 conditions ensemble over Europe and north-eastern North America for the 1950&#8211;2099 period, following the 26 RCP8.5 scenario. More robust results were obtained using the multiple ensemble members for investigating 27 changes in variability and extremes. Moreover, CRCM5 allowed for a much more realistic representation of 28 regional features regarding extreme precipitation 29 30 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 65.24; y0: 393.29; y1: 404.27; width: 8.54; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="393.29" x1="185.58">On snow-related variables  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="393.29" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 393.29; y1: 404.27; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">31 32 The snow cover over North America is projected to decline during the 21st century based on CMIP5 (e.g., 33 Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013; Maloney et al., 2014a) as well as NARCCAP (e.g., McCrary and Mearns, 2019) 34 simulations. However, at sub-continental scales, projections for specific snow-related indices are often 35 highly uncertain in both amount and sign, because drivers of change like temperature and precipitation may 36 have opposing effects and will evolve with spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In terms of mean winter 37 SWE, a decline could occur over most regions except at higher latitudes consistent with projected changes in 38 snowfall (Krasting et al., 2013). 39 40 A recent study using the NARCCAP ensemble (McCrary and Mearns, 2019) reports that continental-41 averaged SWE and snow cover extent are both projected to decrease from the recent past (1971&#8211;1999) to 42 mid-century (2041&#8211;2069), for all months of the year, in all of the models. Regional exceptions occur, with 43 for example winter (January to March) SWE projected to increase at high latitudes. This increase is also 44 found in CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles, although over slightly different areas in these ensembles. Snow 45 cover duration is expected to decrease practically everywhere, with later first snow date (in autumn) and 46 earlier last snow date (in spring). In terms of snow cover fraction, Mudryk et al. (2018) found a mixed 47 picture of decreasing and weak trends during the 2020&#8211;2050 period across seasons and regions over Canada, 48 using a CMIP5 ensemble. Fyfe et al. (2017) demonstrated using the CanESM large ensemble and the 49 CanRCM4 that changes in SWE in the near term (to 2038) could reach 60% decrease in the western US and 50 that natural variability greatly mediates potential future changes in SWE.  51 52 The fraction of precipitation falling as snow could decrease practically everywhere over North America, 53 including in the Great Lakes basin where lake-effect precipitation is important (Suriano and Leathers, 2016). 54 In this basin, the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms is expected to decrease during the 21st century, 55 </span></div></body></html>
