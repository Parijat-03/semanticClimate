<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the present study, we found a direct association between COVID-19 incidence rate and relative humidity, an inverse association between COVID-19 mortality rate and relative humidity, and a direct association between COVID-19 mortality rate and temperature. On the other hand, Correa-Araneda&#8217;s study, which was carried out with data from 121 Chilean cities, showed an inverse association between the infection rate of COVID-19 and the mean temperature and relative humidity while taking into account wind speed [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Unfortunately, we do not have the wind speed available for all cities. If it were available, comparisons with other studies would have been interesting to incorporate into this research. In the study by Pramanik et al. in Russia, the humidity was not directly correlated with COVID-19 cases; however, the authors pointed out that this relationship depends on the climate type [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In India, Gupta&#8217;s study has emphasized that climatic factors do not explain the variability of the number of infected people [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As can be seen, there is no conclusive evidence regarding health indicators of COVID-19 and meteorological factors yet.</p>
