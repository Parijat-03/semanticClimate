The top four contributors to tCO2e emission are Power plants (43%), Vehicles (32%), MSW burning (8%) and domestic cooking (7%); these are based on annual emissions. Seasonal and daily emissions could be variable. For example, MSW burning is more frequent in winter than in summer. The estimated emission suggests that there are many important sources and a composite emission abatement including most of the sources will be required to reduce the GHG emission. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.0" top="607.47"><span x0="72.02" y0="607.47" x1="508.0" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 607.47; y1: 619.47; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">CH4 emission in the city is estimated to be 37078 tonne/yr. The top three contributors to CH4 emissions are livestock (61%), vehicles (18 %), and landfills (9%); these are based on annual emissions. Seasonal and daily emissions could be variable. N2O emissions are lower than CH4 emission ~ 7794 t/d. nearly 92% of emissions are attributed to vehicular emissions. Power plants contribute 3% to N2O emission and are followed by domestic emission (0.5%).

The average consumption of coal in tandoor, based on a survey was 30 kg/day. The total number of hotels and restaurant enterprises was 36,099 (Delhi Statistical Hand Book, 2014). The emissions of GHG estimated from the activity data from each fuel type and then were summed up in each grid cell. The emission factors given by USEPA (2014) were used for estimating GHG emission. </span></div><div left="110.06" right="470.38" top="87.41"><span x0="110.06" y0="87.41" x1="470.38" style="x0: 110.06; x1: 118.06; y0: 87.41; y1: 99.41; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Table 33: GHG emissions from Hotel/Restaurants in Delhi (Tonne/yr) </span></div></body></html>
