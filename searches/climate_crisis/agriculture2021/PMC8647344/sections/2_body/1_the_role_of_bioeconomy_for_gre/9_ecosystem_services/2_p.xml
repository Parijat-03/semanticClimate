A sustainable, circular bioeconomy recognizes the added value of ecosystem services for the environment, the economy, and society. Thus, it ensures they are safeguarded and improved through local co-creative decision planning and implementation. The circular bioeconomy offers a unique opportunity for building decentralized energy production and water and landscape management. It supports the natural capital and improves biodiversity by promoting agroecological farming (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al., 2020</xref>), re-establishing organic carbon and microbiota in the soil and land, recycling nutrients, and contributing to climate mitigation. For example, the deployment of biochar should be promoted as it can permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fight land abandonment due to desertification: more than 8.5 Mha in the Mediterranean region under risk of marginalization (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Chiaramonti and Panoutsou, 2019</xref>). Promoting paludiculture could also be another suitable option for other areas, as peatlands play a significant role in offsetting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through sequestration. They account for ca. 3% of the earth's surface, storing 1.4 trillion tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to 75% of all atmospheres' carbon (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Rowan and Galanakis, 2020</xref>).</p>
