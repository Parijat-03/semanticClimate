This means observing, on a large scale, the ways members of the public express their views about plastics, disposal, and reuse, and then developing communication strategies that align with (or where necessary, challenge) the most prominent and pervasive attitudes towards plastic (re)use. Encouraging everyday behavior change on a large scale involves an uncovering&#160;&#8211; and reframing&#160;&#8211; of the cultural <italic toggle="yes">stories</italic> (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_083" ref-type="bibr">Stibbe 2021b</xref>) underpinning behavior. These are not the stories that are &#8220;read to children at bedtime, shared around a fire, or conveyed through anecdotes in formal speeches&#8221;, but &#8220;cognitive structures in the minds of individuals which influence how they think, talk and act&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_081" ref-type="bibr">Stibbe 2020</xref>: 2). For this reason, it is essential not only that analysis of the discourse used around plastics is based on the systematic examination of large, representative linguistic datasets, but that it is further underpinned by an understanding of language that aligns with the most up-to-date research in the cognitive sciences. Such an understanding is provided by cognitive linguistics, which forms a further important component of our theoretical approach.</p>
