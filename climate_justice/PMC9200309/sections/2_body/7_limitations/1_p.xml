Most importantly, legal cases from certain regions and countries are not all included in the databases searched. While nine translated climate laws and policies are reported from China, including the &#8220;National Plan for Tackling Climate Change 2014&#8211;2020&#8221;, no case litigation is reported, even though there is indication such cases have taken place in China. Similarly, three climate laws and policies are reported from Saudi Arabia including the &#8220;Saudi Arabia Vision 2030&#8221; and 26 from Vietnam, yet no cases are reported for either country.</p>
