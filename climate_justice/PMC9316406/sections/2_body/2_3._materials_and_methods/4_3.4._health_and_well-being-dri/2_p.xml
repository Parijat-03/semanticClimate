<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The two authors collaboratively grouped the codes into three categories, reflecting the three essential components, namely adaptability, interdisciplinarity, and engageability, enhancing GSW practice in the global context of climate change, disasters, and other diverse crises. Under each category, each author presents their critical reflections on the three-level social work interventions (sub-themes) that are aligned with the GSW mandates of building healthy, resilient, and sustainable communities. These critical reflections not only directly address the health and well-being of residents but also illustrate related GSW interventions for the improvement of community-based service programs, service agencies&#8217; roles in community development, and policy and program improvement, supporting the dwellers&#8217; health and well-being. The data analysis structure is shown in <xref rid="healthcare-10-01245-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. </p>
