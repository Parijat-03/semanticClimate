<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In October 2021, the Human Rights Council approved a landmark resolution recognizing the &#8220;right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> Although the resolution provides a significant opportunity to reinforce the human rights obligations of governments during climate change litigation, it is not legally binding. Therefore, countries must also sign regional treaties that recognize the right to a healthy environment for all individuals (not only for children, as in the Convention on the Rights of the Child), such as the Aarhus Convention and the Escaz&#250; Agreement, to increase the enforceability of this right, making successful climate litigation even more achievable.<sup><xref rid="r77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup> These treaties require that the right to a healthy environment be achieved through participation, equality and nondiscrimination, accountability, and transparency. Beyond these two regional instruments, the legal enforceability of national governments&#8217; human rights obligations to engage in ambitious climate change action can be augmented further by the creation of a more powerful, legally binding international agreement incorporating the right to a safe, clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, such as an optional protocol to an existing international human rights covenant or a new international covenant.<sup><xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> Hopefully, this new Human Rights Council resolution, as well as the appointment of a new Special Rapporteur on climate change, might expedite this process.<sup><xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup></p>
