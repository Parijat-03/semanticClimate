Looking at working mothers' mobility in Brussels as a form of reproductive labour or &#8216;domestic mobility work&#8217;, she recognises the efforts and skills required every day from women running a household as well as the unequal burden they face by being responsible for the bulk of trips serving domestic life. The idea of domestic mobility work offers a useful means for articulating the unequal gendered and racialised distribution of domestic work whilst also recognising its social relevance. The contribution by <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Lubitow et al. (2020)</xref> also highlights the importance of gender in processes of recognition. By bringing together transgender geographies and mobilities literature, the authors explore the intersecting forms of oppression that shape &#8216;transmobilities&#8217;. They highlight how an urban environment based on aggression and intolerance immobilises and renders invisible transgender people and give a voice to these subjects, emphasising the intersectional aspects of the injustice they experience when navigating public spaces and especially public transport. The paper also provides insightful policy recommendations for transmobility justice.</p>
