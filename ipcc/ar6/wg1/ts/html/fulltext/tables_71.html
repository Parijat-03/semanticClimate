      <td>Future changes in emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are expected to cause an additional global mean\nwarming, with a large diversity in the end-of-century response across the WGI core set of Shared Socio-economic\nPathways (SSPs), depending upon the level of climate change and air pollution mitigation (Box TS.7, Figure 1). This\nadditional warming is either due to reductions in cooling aerosols for air pollution regulation or due to increases in\nmethane (CH), ozone and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). This additional warming is stable after 2040 in SSPs associated\n4\nwith lower global air pollution as long as CH emissions are also mitigated, but the overall warming induced by SLCF\n4\nchanges is higher in scenarios in which air quality continues to deteriorate (induced by growing fossil fuel use and\nlimited air pollution control) (high confidence).\nSustained CH mitigation reduces global surface ozone, contributing to air quality improvements, and also reduces\n4\nsurface temperature in the longer term, but only sustained CO emissions reductions allow long-term climate\n2\nstabilization (high confidence). Future changes in air quality (near-surface ozone and particulate matter, or PM) at\nglobal and local scales are predominantly driven by changes in ozone and aerosol precursor emissions rather than\nclimate (high confidence). Air quality improvements driven by rapid decarbonization strategies, as in SSP1-1.9 and\nSSP1-2.6, are not sufficient in the near term to achieve air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization in\nsome highly polluted regions (high confidence). Additional policies (e.g., access to clean energy, waste management)\nenvisaged to attain United Nations Sustainable Development Goals bring complementary SLCF reduction. {4.4.4, 6.6.3,\n6.7.3, Box 6.2}</td>

      <td>SSPs (see Section TS.1.3.1), in addition to the warming from long-lived GHGs. The net effect of SLCF and HFC changes in global surface\ntemperature across the SSPs is a likely warming of 0.06&#176;C&#8211;0.35&#176;C in 2040 relative to 2019. This near-term global mean warming\nlinked to SLCFs is quite similar in magnitude across the SSPs due to competing effects of warming (CH, ozone) and cooling (aerosols)\n4\nforcers (Box TS.7, Figure 1). There is greater diversity in the end-of-century response among the scenarios. SLCF changes in scenarios\nwith no climate change mitigation (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) will cause a warming in the likely range of 0.4&#176;C&#8211;0.9&#176;C in 2100 relative to\n2019 due to increases in CH, tropospheric ozone and HFC levels. For the stringent climate change and pollution mitigation scenarios\n4\n(SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), the cooling from reductions in CH, ozone and HFCs partially balances the warming from reduced aerosols,\n4\nprimarily sulphate, and the overall SLCF effect is a likely increase in global surface temperature of 0.0&#176;C&#8211;0.3&#176;C in 2100, relative to\n2019. With intermediate climate change and air pollution mitigations, SLCFs in SSP2-4.5 add a likely warming of 0.2&#176;C&#8211;0.5&#176;C to global\nsurface temperature change in 2100, with the largest warming resulting from reductions in aerosols. {4.4.4, 6.7.3}</td>
