Many of those programmes are more stringent in terms of duration, penalty and minimal exemptions. There are evidences of impact on air quality in those global cities. With this programme several cities have reported a wide range of benefits including reduction in air quality, reduced congestion, improvement in public transport ridership etc. Lowering of pollution levels have been reported in in different cities. In Paris for instance that has implemented this programme in March 2014 and repeated in March 2015, saw 18 % reduction in traffic volume and 6% in pollution levels. But Beijing that has a longer and a more stringent programme has shown 38% reduction in PM10. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.14" top="295.66"><span x0="72.02" y0="295.66" x1="526.14" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 295.66; y1: 307.66; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is piloted its first ever-emergency action to reduce peak pollution levels. This was consistent with global best practice. Vehicles that are second highest emitters in the city were responsible for very high exposure and health impacts. The first few days of the programme demonstrated that the peak pollution levels lowered than the normal smog peaks of the season &#8211; despite the adverse weather conditions. The fuel efficiency norms for passenger cars have been notified by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in April 2015 and the fuel efficiency norms for Heavy Duty Vehicles for Gross Vehicle Weight greater than 12 Tonne has been notified in August 2017. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.3" top="152.83"><span x0="72.02" y0="152.83" x1="526.3" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 152.83; y1: 164.83; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">A study on traffic volume and speed survey carried out by School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, at 11 locations during the first few days of odd and even scheme in Delhi found that due to lowering of traffic volume the travel time has reduced by 35%. This bought out the importance of reducing traffic volume. Delhi Government will continue with odd-even vehicle-rationing scheme if adverse weather conditions continued. </span></div></body></html>
