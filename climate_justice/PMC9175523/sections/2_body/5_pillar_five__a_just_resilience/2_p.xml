It must also be acknowledged that the capacity to realize sustainability transitions may differ significantly between regions (Hansen and Coenen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>). Existing patterns of uneven development may inform new patterns of socio-spatial differentiation in transitions (Bridge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Balta-Ozkan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>), whereby transitions are likely to occur in a spatially homogenous fashion, informed by institutional contexts, prevailing governance models, capacity issues etc. Likewise, responses to climate related disruptions are likely to be space and place specific. For example, Walters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>) reports on respective responses to major flooding events in two different cities, Dhaka in Bangladesh and Brisbane in Australia. Both cities demonstrated considerably different post-flood recovery pathways after floods in 1998 in Dhaka and 2011 in Brisbane. A strong public realm, robust institutions and low inequality levels enabled a strong recovery in Brisbane. By contrast, a deficiency of city-wide institutions and a weak public realm meant that poor communities in Dhaka received little support. An understanding of &#8216;spaces&#8217; and &#8216;places&#8217; is therefore critical in understanding and framing just responses to the challenges of sustainability and resilience (Bahadur and Tanner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>).</p>
