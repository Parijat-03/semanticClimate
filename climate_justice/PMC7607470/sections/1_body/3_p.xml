While climate plans often consider predicted health effects, they less frequently consider the need to adapt primary care services or the more explicit engagement of communities in decisions on activities that might impact both health and the climate crisis. Conversely, national health plans rarely mention climate change, let alone provide a detailed analysis of how primary health care and the wider health system must evolve to meet the challenge from a systems perspective as well as address changing health needs.</p>
