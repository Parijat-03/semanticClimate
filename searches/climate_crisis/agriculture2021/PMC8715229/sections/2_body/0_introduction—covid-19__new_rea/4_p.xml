<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0125">The paper is structured as follows. First a general overview of key characteristics of our current food systems and the case for their transformation is given, drawing particularly on insights from systems analysis and integrated assessments. Then key socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities of food systems, uncovered during the pandemic, are discussed. Considering the challenges and opportunities that the recovery process offers to reset humanity onto a sustainable development trajectory, this then forms the basis for exploring focal areas and entry points for action to build more resilient food systems in the process, helping to secure development gains in an increasingly inter-connected world, which is exposed to a diversity of shocks and hazards.</p>
