<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0200">The final part of my analysis here focusses in on one of the most striking reoccurring power dynamics in these courtroom proceedings: a judge's strident suppression of &#8220;necessity to act&#8221; defences and awkward characterizations of defendants as uncaring troublemakers &#8211; contrasting markedly with land and water protectors' deep intergenerational concerns for the future of the planet and anti-colonial solidarity-building. Framings of care, irreparable harm and imminent peril have become critical points of debate in climate justice discussions globally, from examinations of Greta Thunberg's influences to actions by Extinction Rebellion, Greenpeace and far beyond (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Fallon, 2018</xref>). Discussions of direct action in response to the imminent threats of climate change &#8211; and the irreparable harm with which it is associated &#8211; are reshaping geography as a field in significant ways, raising questions about academic priorities in supporting radical change (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Castree, 2019</xref>). In the BC Supreme Court's &#8220;contempt&#8221; trials, various efforts at advancing necessity defences were tersely dismissed by the court, despite abundant evidence that this was a last resort not taken by defendants without careful consideration, with all alternatives thoroughly exhausted in attempting to influence the NEB<xref rid="fn11" ref-type="fn">11</xref>
prior to standing on the road in Burnaby Mountain. It is instructive to consider the political geographies of care and justice that emerged in response to the judge's disregard for the issues at hand &#8211; vital inter-related notions in critically challenging narrow visions of &#8220;imminent peril.&#8221;</p>
