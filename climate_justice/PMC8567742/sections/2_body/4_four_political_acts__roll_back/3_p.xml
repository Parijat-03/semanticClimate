The rollback campaign started at the onset of global neoliberalism, beginning with the partial rollback of land reforms initiated by Frei and Allende in Chile, immediately after General Pinochet seized state power through a military coup (Kay, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2002b</xref>, pp. 470&#8211;471). This rollback campaign has gained momentum since then. The dismantling of regulatory institutions in land, such as state cooperatives and collective farms, spread rapidly &#8211; if unevenly &#8211; in the 1990s (Ho &amp; Spoor, <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lahiff et al., <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Spoor, <xref rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Institutions in land access that regulate land sales and rental markets such as land size ceiling laws, or those that actively promote community or collective arrangements, such as the <italic toggle="yes">ejido</italic> system in Mexico to prevent land concentration, have increasingly been deregulated (Akram-Lodhi et al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zoomers &amp; van der Haar, <xref rid="CIT0114" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). State support to beneficiaries of land redistribution has been withdrawn.</p>
