To address the need to simplify and increase the relevance of information for specific contexts, recent studies have adopted storyline and narrative approaches (Section&#160;1.4.4.2; Hazeleger et&#160;al., 2015; Shepherd et&#160;al., 2018). As such, these approaches are an important tool for the climate information distillation (Section&#160;10.5.3). Here we assess these in a&#160;regional climate information context, namely for exploring uncertainties, embedding climate information into a&#160;given user context, and communicating climate change information.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.08" top="162.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="162.6" x1="549.08" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.44; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Physical climate storylines are self-consistent and plausible unfolding of a&#160;physical trajectory of the climate system, or a&#160;weather or climate event, on time scales from hours to multiple decades (Section&#160;1.4.4.2). Storylines that condition climatic features and processes on a&#160;set of plausible but distinct large-scale climatic changes enables the exploration of uncertainties in regional climate projections (Box&#160;10.2, Figure&#160;1 and Section&#160;10.3.4.2). For instance, Zappa and Shepherd (2017) condition projected changes in European surface wind speeds on different plausible projections of tropical upper tropospheric warming and the polar vortex strength in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Storylines of specific events are generated to explore the unfolding and impacts of comparable events in counterfactual climates (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et&#160;al., 2015b; Takayabu et&#160;al., 2015; Hegdahl et&#160;al., 2020; Sillmann et&#160;al., 2021). Those event storylines can be based on pseudo-global warming studies (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et&#160;al., 2015b; Takayabu&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2015; see Section&#160;10.3.2.2), selected and possibly downscaled events from long-term climate projections (Hegdahl et&#160;al., 2020; Huang&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2020a),</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="714.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="714.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.09; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">and tailoring the uncertainty information to specific decision frameworks have the potential for reducing problems of distilling and communicating uncertain climate information (J.

Services are expected to be based on scientifically credible information and expertise, have appropriate engagement from users and providers, have an effective access mechanism and aim at meeting the users&#8217; needs (Hewitt et&#160;al., 2020). To achieve this, climate services synthesize context-relevant climate information addressing questions for a&#160;wide range of climate time scales. From this point of view, climate services are instruments for the production, translation and transfer of climate information and knowledge for their use in climate-informed decision-making and climate-smart policy and planning (Hewitt et&#160;al., 2012). The appropriate provision of climate services considers the diagnosis of climate information needs, the service itself and a&#160;number of good practices still under development (Vaughan et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="438.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="438.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The preceding subsections assess research on the distillation of climate information, which is directly relevant for the development of climate&#160;services. Distillation, when implemented appropriately and interpreted with all due caveats, leads to credible climate information with a&#160;broader foundation of evidence to be used in climate services practice according to the recommendations of the Global Framework for Climate Services (Hewitt et&#160;al., 2012). As stated in Chapter&#160;12, climate services set new scientific challenges to research. Examples of some of the challenges have been given in Chapters 1 and 12, which are complemented by the barriers to the distillation assessed in Section&#160;10.5.3.3.</span></div></body></html>
