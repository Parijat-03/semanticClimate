Ostrom, Peter Levine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>) writes that &#8220;what can we do?&#8221; is the most important question facing citizens, with citizen defined as anyone who seriously takes up this question. The question&#8217;s emphasis on groups (&#8220;we&#8221;) and action (&#8220;do&#8221;) shifts focus away from what <italic>should</italic> happen, or what governments <italic>should</italic> do, towards what we can and must do to transform society and government policy through participation in organizations and networks in ways that we, through deliberation with others, define as right and good. We may need to create new groups and adopt group principles that facilitate effective deliberation and action. For Ostrom, Levine further explains, processes and means, strategies and tactics of change and self-governance, matter more than &#8220;fully specified ideals of a good society&#8221; (106).</p>
