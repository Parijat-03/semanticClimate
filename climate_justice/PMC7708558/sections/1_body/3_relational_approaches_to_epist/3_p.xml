Evan Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2010</xref>), for instance, argues that closing the explanatory gap between consciousness and life is possible by incorporating phenomenological accounts of experience into scientific accounts of mind and life. Frequently, 4E approaches are also called 4EA, so as to include the growing field of affect studies (Gregg and Seigworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>)&#8212;an interdisciplinary body of research taking relational approaches to emotions (Slaby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2016</xref>) that has examined emotional relationships to environments (Bladow and Ladino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>), media ecology (Angerer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>), and body politics (Protevi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2009</xref>).</p>
