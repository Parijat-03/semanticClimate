The city&#8217;s inhabitants have been experiencing the subordination of local social structures to tourist needs for decades, a&#160;process that has led to displacement through the establishment of a&#160;tourist monoculture. While the historic center had 174,808 inhabitants in 1951, the figure for 2014 was 56,311 (Casagrande <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>: 125). Although tourism has long been a&#160;lucrative business for investors and residents alike, it is mainly the latter who have addressed the industry&#8217;s negative effects on the city over the last two decades. These effects have driven the city&#8217;s inhabitants to the streets and squares in increasing numbers. Coalitions of associations, organizations, and committees are evidence not just of the city&#8217;s problems, but also of the initiative and agency of its inhabitants (cf. Araya L&#243;pez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>; Dlabaja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). This engagement underlines Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s notion of the city &#8220;as a&#160;resource of society&#8221; (Schmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>: 32), and it shows a&#160;demand for participation in the shaping of the economic, social, and cultural resources which are increasingly being transferred to external stakeholders.</p>
