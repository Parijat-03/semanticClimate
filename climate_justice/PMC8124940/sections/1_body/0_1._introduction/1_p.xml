This trend has raised concerns about climate injustice&#8212;the extent to which socially vulnerable groups are more likely to be exposed to the negative consequences of elevated temperatures while also being less likely to mitigate its harmful effects [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Climate justice activists and scholars have thus emphasized the need to &#8216;recognise humanity&#8217;s responsibility for the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society by critically addressing inequality and promoting transformative approaches to address the root causes of climate change&#8217; [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (p. 3). In large metropolitan regions, the formation of urban heat islands is one major cause of rising temperatures [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These occur due to the structural density of land cover in cities where buildings and impervious surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, retain and re-radiate thermal energy while preventing evapotranspiration, causing a localized intensification of atmospheric heat [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While greenspaces are one way to counter urban heat islands, previous studies have shown that socially vulnerable populations face greater urban heat exposure [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as well as reside in areas that lack vegetation [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
