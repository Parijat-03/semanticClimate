Strong negative correlations have been detected in southern Montana, western Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah before the wildfire season, which indicates people avoided visiting the parks when the number of the COVID&#8208;19 cases was high in those regions. This reflects similar patterns seen in several previous studies on how infectious diseases might impact the changes in human mobility and behaviors. People who stay at home or avoid places with high disease rates are shown to reduce the links of possible contagion (Funk et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, these strong negative relationships weakened over time from June&#8211;September, indicating the decreasing trend of the degree of concern regarding the pandemic, which might result from the increasing registrations and acceptance of vaccines (Al&#8208;Amer et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In most counties within the study area, people tended to travel closer to parks and spend less time there when more COVID&#8208;19 cases were reported, especially in June to August. This pattern might be explained by two possible reasons: people may restrict their long&#8208;time outdoor recreation behavior, or, with the stay&#8208;at&#8208;home order lifted, they spend time doing other things. This is consistent with the findings from Odell&#160;(<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), who reported that the time that people spent on physical activity decreased after stay&#8208;at&#8208;home orders.</p>
