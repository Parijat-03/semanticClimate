To detect potential missingness mechanisms, we will investigate associations between dichotomous variables identifying respondents with missing data and sociodemographic measures using logistic regression models. Cronbach&#8217;s alpha will be used to investigate internal consistency of scales. After computing mean scores, scale distributions as well as floor and ceiling effects will be analysed descriptively.</p>
