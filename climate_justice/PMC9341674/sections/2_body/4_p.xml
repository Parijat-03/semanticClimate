Collecting this evidence requires foresight, meticulous record-keeping, peer support, and the courage to withstand questioning of professional capacity. The causal link must be made, and expert testimony will be decisive. It took Sir Stephen Holgate 18 months to compile the evidence that air pollution was a causal factor in the death of 9-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah in London. In 2021, the UK government announced measures to tackle air pollution after a coroner ordered that Ella&#8217;s death certificate to be amended to note toxic air contributed to her death. The partnership between the legal team, the scientist and Ella&#8217;s mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah was key in the coroner reaching this decision.<xref rid="ckac057-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
