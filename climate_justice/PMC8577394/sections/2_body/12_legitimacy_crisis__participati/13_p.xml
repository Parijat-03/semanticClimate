With a few caveats, Deltares backed the city&#8217;s decision to go with a new plan. Yet shortly before the publication of the independent report, activists discovered that the city had hired Deltares as a consultant for an infrastructure projected elsewhere in Manhattan, and so the firm&#8217;s technical advice became tarnished by the suspicion of underlying financial motivations: In the view of activists, Deltares supported the city&#8217;s plan in an informal exchange for the future award of contracts. Thus with every move the city made to continue appealing to technical experts, they only became more mired in suspicions of dishonest political motivations, and were unable to extricate themselves from the legitimacy crisis they had created.</p>
