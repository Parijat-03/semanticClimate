We need to redouble our efforts in the face of the threats to the peoples that continue the struggle for the transformation of corporate food systems. The attention needs to be focused on small-scale producers who, according to indicators, produce 70% of the world&#8217;s food. Efforts need to continue to promote agroecological practices, transform food systems towards the approaches that have emerged from our counter-mobilization and to join alliances with other social movements that are fighting on other fundamental issues such as climate change, health or desertification. All these elements are interrelated with the problems we are experiencing in terms of land dispossession, health, and the effects of climate change.</p>
