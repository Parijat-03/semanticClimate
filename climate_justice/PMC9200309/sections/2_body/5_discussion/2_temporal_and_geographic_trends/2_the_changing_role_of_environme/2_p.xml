<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Regarding human rights, several powerful case studies illustrate a trend towards petitioners increasingly employing rights claims in climate change lawsuits. In the <italic toggle="yes">Urgenda</italic> case (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 1), the courts decided that human rights, which include the &#8220;right to health&#8221; is linked with decarbonization. In a case brought by <italic toggle="yes">Friends of the Irish Environment</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], the courts held that Ireland&#8217;s national mitigation plan partially violated statutory law, because it was not set to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently over the near term. In this case, human rights were used as part of the justification.</p>
