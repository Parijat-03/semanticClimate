The fossil fuel divestment movement, started by students at Swarthmore College and championed by 350, has caught fire&#160;around the globe&#160;and has led to institutional divestments of $14.48 trillion (Fossil Free <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Another group, Citizens&#8217; Climate Lobby, is committed to federal carbon pricing legislation. The group has mobilized its supporters to lobby members of Congress to support the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. To date, their efforts have resulted in co-sponsorship of the bill by 82 members of Congress and the introduction of 9 other carbon pricing bills into the 116th Congress (Citizens&#8217; Climate Lobby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Resources for the Future <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>).</p>
