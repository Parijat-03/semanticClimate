However, on careful examination, these alternative explanations do not stand up to scrutiny. First, one could imagine, for example, that activists in general live further inland than public housing residents, and so flooding is less likely to affect them, leading them to deprioritize flood protection. This is not the case, however, since the majority of the vocal activists I spoke to lived either in market housing near the shore, or in one of the many private apartment complexes that interlocked with public housing buildings on the shore. All experienced some degree of flood damage during Sandy. Danny, for example, quoted earlier in this article, lives in a co-op building near the water.</p>
