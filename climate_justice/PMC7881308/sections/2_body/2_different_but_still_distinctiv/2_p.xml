Clinical programmes should look to develop new services rather than seeking to simply&#160;replicate existing services in remote mode. They should focus on maintaining the role of students taking responsibility and learning by doing and reflecting on their work. The pandemic will continue to change, and clinical programmes need to continue to respond to new circumstances. This is best achieved through use of flexible practices within effective structures. Structure will be important in providing students, staff, and clients with a sense of certainty and connection in uncertain times.</p>
