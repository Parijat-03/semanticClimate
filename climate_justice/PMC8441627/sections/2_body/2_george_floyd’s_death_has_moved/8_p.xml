<p>Trump is a modern&#8208;day McCarthy, thriving on lies and innuendos. On 9 June 2020, he tweeted that Martin Gugino, the 75&#8208;year&#8208;old man who fell on his head and started bleeding from his ear after being pushed by a policeman, &#8216;could be an ANTIFA provocateur&#8217; trying to block out police communications.

Trump got this totally baseless conspiracy theory from a far&#8208;right cable news channel that had aired false information in the past. Gugino is a long&#8208;time peace activist &#8216;involved in a range of political issues, including immigration, climate justice, prisoners&#8217; rights, economic justice, and homelessness&#8217; (Nashrulla&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
