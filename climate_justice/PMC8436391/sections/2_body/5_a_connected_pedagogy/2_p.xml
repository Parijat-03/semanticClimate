<p>Our pedagogy embeds course content that makes significant connection to contemporary or
emerging social issues or trends at local and global levels. <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Ife (2019</xref>, p. 9) argues we are living at a time of significant change and multiple
crises&#8212;ecological, economic, social and political. Globalization and neoliberal ideology
have together created a global economy that is inequitable, unsustainable and has created
&#8220;obscene levels of inequality&#8221; (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Ife,
2019</xref>, p. 9). The current Coronavirus pandemic is a new crisis facing communities and
societies, one which is amplifying existing social inequalities (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Drane, Vernon and O&#8217;Shea, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Kenny, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the current context for social work practice, which is
ensconced in neoliberalism, is one that emphasizes individualism or individual achievement
rather than the social sources of oppression which perpetuate poverty, exclusion and
disadvantage (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Lathouras, 2016</xref>). As social work posits
an aim to work for social justice at local and global levels (recognizing these
interconnections), it therefore needs to commit to identifying and questioning harmful divisions
of unequal power relations (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Morley
