<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0065">This section opens with perhaps the most powerful first person account of the book with the story of Nicole Montalto, a resident of Staten Island, New York. Nicole describes her harrowing escape from her childhood home that her father had lived in since he was six years old during Hurricane Sandy. Anyone familiar with watching media coverage of hurricanes is familiar with the large scale destruction that they can bring to communities and states. Nicole details the increasing severity of the storm, and the confusion and anxiety of not being able to contact her father, who remained behind while she drove to a safer location. Nicole&#8217;s father ended up passing away, probably due to injuries sustained from the rush of water into their home.</p>
