Impacts on health can result directly from environmental shocks and indirectly through socially mediated effects (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Climate change&#8208;related risks in Africa include flooding, drought, heatwaves, reduced food production, and reduced labour productivity (<xref rid="hsr2861-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
