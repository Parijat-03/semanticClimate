A basic assumption we have is that whether or not some rural people become vulnerable to climate change depends in part on their location in the spheres of production and social reproduction; and in the rural areas, access to land can be a decisive factor, where some may prosper while most others suffer pauperization amid severe climatic disruptions (see, e.g. Watts, <xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>/<xref rid="CIT0104" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Access</italic> to land &#8211; that is, social relations and politics of land &#8211; is thus key in thinking about how to address climate change from a social justice perspective especially because a significant part of climate mitigation and adaptation ideas and actions require maintaining or reordering access to natural resources (land, forest, water). We argue that problems in access to land (lack of, diminished, or precarious access) are the dominant defining feature of contemporary rural land politics in the world, and this problem is exacerbated by climate actions that do not address the land question from a redistributive justice perspective. Prior and/or accompanying democratization of access to land are key to climate justice, but the current global climate in land policy is overwhelmingly against redistributive approaches. Policy perspectives that do not specify what they mean by &#8216;land tenure security&#8217; are likely to be interpreted within the dominant non-redistributive framework, and are thus dangerous for rural working people. We construct our argument by mapping, historicizing and typologizing key currents in mainstream political stance on land policies, and what these imply for climate actions.</p>
