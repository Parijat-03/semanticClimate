To illustrate, Carlson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) demonstrates that administrative/regulatory capacity has been key to California&#8217;s climate policy innovation. Meckling and Nahm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2018</xref>) argue that when state legislatures delegate significant policymaking authority to executive branch agencies, the latter tend to be relatively depoliticized and less susceptible to powerful interest groups. However, the success of administrative delegation is contingent on administrative capacity (Meckling and Nahm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2018</xref>).</p>
