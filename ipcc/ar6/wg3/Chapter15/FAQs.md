## Frequently asked questions(FAQs)

* FAQ 15.1 What’s the role of climate finance and the finance sector for a transformation towards 
 a sustainable future?

The Paris Agreement has widened the scope of all financial flows from climate finance only to the full 
 alignment of finance flows with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. While climate finance 
 relates historically to the financial support of developed countries to developing countries, the Paris 
 Agreement and its Article 2.1(c) has developed on a new narrative on that goes much beyond traditional 
 flows and relates to all sectors and actors. Finance flows are consistent when the effects are either 
 neutral with or without positive climate co-benefits to climate objectives; or explicitly targeted on 
 climate benefits in adaptation and/or mitigation result areas. Climate-related financial risk is still 
 massively underestimated by financial institutions, financial decision-makers more generally and also 
 among public sector stakeholders limiting the sector’s potential of being an enabler of the transition. 
 The private sector has started to recognise climate-related risks and consequently redirect investment 
 flows. Dynamics vary across sectors and regions with the financial sector being an enabler of transitions 
 in only some selected (sub-)sectors and regions. Consistent, credible, timely and forward-looking 
 political leadership remains central to strengthen the financial sector as enabler
 
 * FAQ 15.2 What’s the current status of global climate finance and the alignment of global financial 
 flows with the Paris Agreement?
 
 There is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term 'climate finance' is applied to the financial 
 resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local 
 scales, including international financial flows to developing countries to assist them in addressing 
 climate change. Total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect aims to reduce 
 net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to the impacts of current and 
 projected climate change. This includes private and public funds, domestic and international flows and 
 expenditures. Tracking of climate finance flows faces limitations, in particular for national climate 
 finance flows. 
 Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. Annual 
 global climate finance flows are on an upward trend since the fifth Assessment Report, according to 
 CPI reaching more than 630 billion USD in 2019/2020, however, growth has likely slowed down and 
 flows remain significantly below needs. This is driven by barriers within and outside the financial 
 sector. More than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities despite the strong economic 
 rationale of adaptation action. Adjusting for higher estimates on current flows for energy efficiency 
 based on IEA data, the dominance of mitigation becomes even stronger. Persistently high levels of both 
 public and private fossil-fuel related financing as well as other misaligned flows continue to be of major 
 concern despite promising recent commitments. Significant progress has been made in the commercial 
 finance sector with regard to the awareness of climate risks resulting from inadequate financial flows 
 and climate action. However, a more consequent investment and policy decision making that enables a rapid redirection of financial flows is needed. Regulatory support as a catalyser is an essential convey 
 of such redirections. Dynamics across sectors and regions vary with some being better positioned to 
close financing gaps and to benefit from an enabling role of finance in the short-term. 


* FAQ 15.3 What defines a financing gap, and where are the critically identified gaps?

A financing gap is defined as the difference between current flows and average needs to meet the long 
term goals of the Paris Agreement. Gaps are driven by various barriers inside (short-termism, 
 information gaps, home bias, limited visibility of future pipelines) and outside (e.g. missing pricing of 
 externalities, missing regulatory frameworks) of the financial sector. Current mitigation financing flows 
 come in significantly below average needs across all regions and sectors despite the availability of 
 sufficient capital on a global basis. Globally, yearly climate finance flows have to increase by factor 
 between 3 to 6 to meet average annual needs until 2030.
 Gaps are in particular concerning for many developing countries with COVID-19 exacerbating the 
 macroeconomic outlook and fiscal space for governments. Also, limited institutional capacity 
 represents a key barrier for many developing countries burdening risk perceptions and access to 
 appropriately priced financing as well as limiting their ability to actively manage the transformation. 
 Existing fundamental inequities in access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries 
 exposure to physical impacts of climate change overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just 
 transition.
