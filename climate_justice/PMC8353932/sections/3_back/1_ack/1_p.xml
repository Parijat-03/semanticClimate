I am especially indebted to Mike Hulme for his intellectual insights and generous hospitality when I stayed in Cambridge. I owe him, both academically and personally, the idea of this paper. I also thank four anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and Saffron O&#8217;Neill and Roz Pidcock for their tireless editorial work for compiling all submitted manuscripts in this special issue.</p>
