CHEEA compensated the two facilitators via their salaries and CHA donated the physical space, which included a large room for didactic sessions and several smaller rooms for the small groups. Materials required included audiovisual equipment for showing the PowerPoint presentations and accompanying videos, a whiteboard for note-taking during the group discussions, printed copies of the story of self small-group guide and evaluation form, and pens.</p>
