<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0135">Meanwhile, the modelling community should rapidly accelerate its initial efforts to investigate alternative deliberation options: those that go beyond the &#8220;cost-effectiveness&#8221; mode <xref rid="b0785" ref-type="bibr">[157]</xref>, which prioritises understanding how to achieve the warming cap at the lowest possible cost. Such options can include: exploring a diversity of scenarios that reflect a range of desirable transitions to achieve different decarbonisation goals <xref rid="b0790" ref-type="bibr">[158]</xref>; understanding &#8220;robust&#8221; strategies to achieving such goals <xref rid="b0795" ref-type="bibr">[159]</xref> in the face of a range of future scenarios; seeking mechanisms to handle counter-GDP-growth scenarios of negative growth; and downscaling and degrowth/post-growth implications. At the same time, the modelling community has realised that there is no &#8220;one model fits all&#8221; approach and it should build on its efforts to make IAMs increasingly sophisticated by supplementing them with a range of other tools and analytical techniques, to cover temporal and spatial scales that currently cannot realistically be represented <xref rid="b0740" ref-type="bibr">[148]</xref>. For example, by combining long-range IAMs with short-term models of the macro-economy, useful insights can be gleaned on the full range of potential impacts of shocks, such as COVID-19 and associated policy and societal responses.</p>
