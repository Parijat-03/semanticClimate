[<xref rid="B24-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] developed tyrosinase/TiO2 biosensor to determine the presence of atrazine pesticides. This was done by fabricating a structure through the allowance of vertical growth of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes. This meant that well-arranged nanotubes would provide large surface areas for immobilizing the tyrosinase enzyme. The structure gave room for excellent loading of enzymes, as well as transfer of electrons, which yielded improved system robustness and sensitivity. The system was tested in well-grinded, air-dried paddy soils, gathered at varying depths. The soil also passed through a sieving process using a 1.0 mm filter, and a 35 &#176;C re-drying process that lasted for 48 hrs. It was subsequently mixed with acetone, prior to undergoing shaking at a temperature of 25 &#176;C for 60 min. Results given by [<xref rid="B24-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed that after carrying out analysis of supernatants, atrazine was observed to be present in 0.2 ppt to 2 part-per-billion. Standard deviation was subsequently found to be below 0.05 ppt when compared to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</p>
