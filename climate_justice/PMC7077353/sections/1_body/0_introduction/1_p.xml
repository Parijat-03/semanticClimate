The SDG goals and targets are comprehensive because they integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development (paragraph 5) and are founded on the respect, protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms (paragraph 19). In committing to Agenda 2030, UN member states:
<disp-quote specific-use="block"><p>we pledge that no one will be left behind. Recognizing that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society. And we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first. (UN General Assembly <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
