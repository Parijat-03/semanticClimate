More work could be done in understanding how to prioritize and implement adaptation projects in a state with hazards and communities as diverse as California&#8217;s. Scholarship employing community-engaged methods [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] is needed to research framings and language that reflect how communities want to be represented in policy and research. Limitations and opportunities in scales of implementation are also unclear. Research is needed on how to balance the intricacies of risk with techniques that allow stakeholders to monitor and quantify the impacts of equity-oriented adaptation projects. Future work could also consider the distinctions between rural and urban vulnerability and their unique adaptation needs. Further, additional research could study conflicting forms of vulnerability and adaptive capacity across hazards, such as tree coverage reducing extreme heat risk while potentially increasing wildfire risk. Finally, future work could establish best practices for on-the-ground index validation in support of fine-scale and large-scale implementation.</p>
