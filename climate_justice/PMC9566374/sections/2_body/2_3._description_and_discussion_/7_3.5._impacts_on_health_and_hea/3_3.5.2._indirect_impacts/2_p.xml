Moreover, climate change could aggravate or increase some allergic diseases [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B89-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This is especially important in cities with Mediterranean climates, where some of the ornamental species native to the Mediterranean and abundant in urban green spaces are among the main allergy-causing agents in the population [<xref rid="B90-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A study carried out in the city of Malaga reported that the trend of increasing temperature and atmospheric aridity is the cause of the increasing tendency of <italic toggle="yes">Quercus</italic> pollen production in spring in the western Mediterranean. It concludes that the effect of climate change is mainly reflected in the pollination intensity of anemophilous woody species, which in turn have adapted their flowering time to climate change [<xref rid="B91-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p>
