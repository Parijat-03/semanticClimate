 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Executive summary Chapter  3  assesses  the  emissions  pathways  literature  in  order  to  identify  their  key characteristics (both in commonalities and differences) and to understand how societal choices may  steer  the  system  into  a  particular  direction(high  confidence).  More than  2000  quantitative emissions pathways were submitted to the  IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) database,  out of which 1202 scenarios included sufficient information for assessing the associated warming consistent with WGI.  Five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) were selected, each emphasizing a different scenario element as its defining feature: heavy reliance on renewables (IMP-Ren), strong emphasis on energy demand reductions (IMP-LD), extensive use of CDR in the energy and the industry sectors to achieve  net  negative  emissions  (IMP-Neg),  mitigation  in  the  context  of  broader  sustainable development  (IMP-SP),  and  the implications  of  a less  rapid  and  gradual  strengthening  of  near-term mitigation actions (IMP-GS).{3.2, 3.3} Pathways  consistent  with  the  implementation  and  extrapolation  of  countries’  current  policies see GHG emissions reaching 52-60 GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2030 and to 46-67 GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2050, leading  to  a  median  global  warming  of  2.4°C  to  3.5°C  by  2100(medium  confidence).  These pathways  consider  policies  at  the  time  that  they  were  developed.  The  Shared  Socioeconomic Pathways  (SSPs)  permit  a  more  systematic  assessment  of  future  GHG  emissions  and  their uncertainties  than  was  possible  in  AR5.  The  main  emissions  drivers  include  growth  in  population, reaching 8.5-9.7 billion by 2050, and an increase in global GDP of 2.7-4.1% per year between 2015 and  2050.  Final  energy  demand  in  the  absence  of  any  new  climate  policies  is  projected  to  grow  to around 480 to 750 EJ yr-1 in 2050 (compared to around 390 EJ in 2015).  (medium confidence) The highest  emissions  scenarios  in  the  literature  result  in  global  warming  of  >5°C  by  2100,  based  on assumptions of rapid economic growth and pervasive climate policy failures. (high confidence). {3.3}  Many  pathways  in  the  literature  show  how  to  likely  limit  global  warming  compared  to preindustrial times to 2°C with no overshoot or to 1.5°C with limited overshoot. The likelihood of  limiting  warming  to  1.5C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  has  dropped  in  AR6  compared  to SR1.5 because global GHG emissions have risen since the time SR1.5 was published, leading to higher  near-term  emissions  (2030)  and  higher  cumulative  CO2  emissions  until  the  time  of  net zero  (medium  confidence).Only  a  small  number  of  published  pathways  limit  global  warming  to 1.5°C without overshoot over the course of the 21st century. {3.3, Annex III.II.3} Cost-effective mitigation pathways assuming immediate actions to  likely limit warming to 2°C are associated with net global GHG emissions of 30-49 GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2030 and 13-27 GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2050(medium confidence). This corresponds to reductions, relative to 2019 levels, of 12-46% by 2030 and 52-77% by 2050. Pathways that limit global warming to below 1.5°C with no or limited  overshoot  require  a  further  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  the  transformation,  with  net  GHG emissions  typically  around  21-36  GtCO2-eq  yr-1  by  2030  and  1-15  GtCO2-eq  yr-1  by  2050;  thus reductions of 38–63% by 2030 and 75-98% by 2050 relative to 2019 levels. {3.3} Page 13
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII overshoot  of  1.5°C  increases  the  risks  from  climate  impacts  and  increases  the  dependence  on  large scale  carbon  dioxide  removal  from  the  atmosphere.  A  future  consistent  with  current  NDCs  implies higher fossil fuel deployment and lower reliance on low carbon alternatives until 2030, compared to mitigation pathways with immediate action to likely limit warming to 2°C and below. To likely limit warming  to  2°C  after  following  the  NDCs  to  2030,  the  pace  of  global  GHG  emission  reductions would need to accelerate quite rapidly from 2030 onward: to an average of 1.3-2.1 GtCO2-eq per year  between  2030  and  2050,  which  is  similar  to  global  CO2  emission  reductions  in  2020  due  to  the COVID-19  pandemic,  and  around  70%  faster  than  in  immediate  action  pathways  likely  limiting warming to 2°C. Accelerating emission reductions after following an NDC pathway to 2030 would be particularly challenging because of the continued build-up of fossil fuel infrastructure that would be expected to take place between now and 2030. {3.5, 4.2} Pathways accelerating actions compared to current NDCs that reduce annual GHG emissions to 47  (38-51)  GtCO2-eq  by  2030,  or  3-9  GtCO2-eq  below  projected  emissions  from  fully implementing current NDCs reduce the mitigation challenge for likely limiting warming to 2°C after 2030. (medium confidence). The accelerated action pathways are characterized by a global, but regionally differentiated, roll-out of regulatory and pricing policies. Compared to NDCs, they see less fossil fuels and more low-carbon fuels until 2030, and narrow, but do not close the gap to pathways assuming  immediate  global  action  using  all  available  least-cost  abatement  options.  All  delayed  or accelerated  action  pathways  likely  limiting  warming  to  below  2°C  converge  to  a  global  mitigation regime  at  some  point  after  2030  by  putting  a  significant  value  on  reducing  carbon  and  other  GHG emissions in all sectors and regions. {3.5} Mitigation  pathways  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  reach  50% reductions of CO2 in the 2030s, relative to 2019, then reduce emissions further to reach net zero CO2 emissions in the 2050s. Pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C reach 50% reductions in the 2040s and net zero CO2 by 2070s (medium confidence).  {3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3} Peak warming in mitigation pathways is determined by the cumulative net CO2 emissions until the time of net zero CO2 and the warming contribution of other GHGs and climate forcers at that time (high confidence).  Cumulative net CO2 emissions from 2020 to the time of net zero CO2 are 510 (330-710) GtCO2 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 890 (640-1160) GtCO2 in pathways likely limiting warming to 2.0°C. These estimates are consistent with  the  assessment  of  remaining  carbon  budgets  by  WGI  after  adjusting  for  differences  in  peak warming levels. {3.3, Box 3.4} Rapid  reductions  in  non-CO2  GHGs,  particularly  methane,  would  lower  the  level  of  peak warming (high confidence). Residual non-CO2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero CO2 range between 4-11 GtCO2-eq yr-1 in pathways likely limiting warming to 2.0°C or below. Methane (CH4) is  reduced  by  around  20%  (1-46%)  in  2030  and  almost  50%  (26-64%)  in  2050,  relative  to  2019. Methane emission reductions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are substantially  higher  by  2030,  33%  (19-57%),  but  only  moderately  so  by  2050,  50%  (33-69%). Methane emissions reductions are thus attainable at relatively lower GHG prices but are at the same time limited in scope in most 1.5-2°C pathways. Deeper methane emissions reductions by 2050 could further  constrain  the  peak  warming.  N2O  emissions  are  reduced  too,  but  similar  to  CH4,  emission reductions  saturate  for  more  stringent  climate  goals.  In  the  mitigation  pathways,  the  emissions  of cooling aerosols are reduced due to reduced use of fossil fuels. The overall impact on non-CO2-related warming combines these factors. {3.3} Page 14
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Net zero GHG emissions imply net negative CO2 emissions at a level compensating residual non-CO2  emissions. Only  30%  of  the  pathways  likely  limiting  warming  to  2°C  or  below  reach  net zero  GHG  emissions  in  the  21st  century.(high  confidence).  In  those  pathways  reaching  net  zero GHGs,  it  is  achieved  around  10-20  years  later  than  for  net  zero  CO2.  (medium  confidence).  The reported quantity of residual non-CO2 emissions depends on accounting: the choice of GHG metric. Reaching and sustaining global net zero GHG emissions, measured in terms of GWP-100, results in a gradual  decline  of  temperature.  (high  confidence)  {3.3,  Cross-Chapter  Box  3  in  Chapter  3,  Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2} Pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C and below exhibit substantial reductions in emissions from all  sectors (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions reductions between 2019 and 2050 in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot are around 77% (31-96%) for energy demand, 115% for energy  supply  (90  to  167%),  and  148%  for  AFOLU  (94  to  387%).  In  pathways  likely  limiting warming  to  2°C,  projected  CO2  emissions  are  reduced  between  2019  and  2050  by  around  49%  for energy demand, 97% for energy supply, and 136% for AFOLU. (medium confidence){3.4} Delaying  or  sacrificing  emissions  reductions  in  one  sector  or  region  involves  compensating reductions in  other  sectors  or  regions  if warming is to  be limited  (high  confidence). Mitigation pathways  show  differences  in  the  timing  of  decarbonization  and  when  net  zero  CO2  emissions  are achieved across sectors and regions. At the time of global net zero CO2 emissions, emissions in some sectors  and  regions  are  positive  while  others  are  negative;  the  ordering  depends  on  the  mitigation options available, the cost of those options, and the policies implemented. In cost-effective mitigation pathways, the energy supply sector typically reaches net zero CO2 before the economy as a whole, while the demand sectors reach net zero CO2 later, if ever (high confidence). {3.4} Pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C and below involve substantial reductions in fossil fuel consumption  and  a  near  elimination  of  the  use  of  coal  without  CCS  (high  confidence).  These pathways show an increase in low carbon energy, with 88% (69-97%) of primary energy coming from these sources by 2100. {3.4} Stringent  emissions  reductions  at  the  level  required  for  2°C  and  below  are  achieved  through increased  direct  electrification  of  buildings,  transport,  and  industry,  resulting  in  increased electricity  generation  in  all  pathways  (high  confidence).  Nearly  all  electricity  in  pathways  likely limiting  warming  to  2℃  or  below  is  from  low  or  no  carbon  technologies,  with  different  shares  of nuclear, biomass, non-biomass renewables, and fossil CCS across pathways. {3.4} The  measures  required  to  likely  limit  warming  to  2°C  or  below  can  result  in  large  scale transformation of the land surface (high confidence). Pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C or below are projected to reach net zero CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector between 2020s and 2070, with an increase of forest cover of about 322 million ha (-67 to 890 million ha) in 2050 in pathways limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot.  Cropland  area  to  supply  biomass  for bioenergy  (including  BECCS)  is  around  199  (56-482)  million  ha  in  2100  in  pathways  limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. The use of bioenergy can lead to either increased or reduced emissions, depending on the scale of deployment, conversion technology, fuel displaced, and how/where the biomass is produced (high confidence). {3.4} Page 15
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Pathways  that  likely  limiting  warming  to  2°C  or  below  involve  some  amount  of  CDR  to compensate for residual GHGemissions remaining after substantial direct emissions reductions in  all  sectors  and  regions  (high  confidence).  CDR  deployment  in  pathways  serves  multiple purposes: accelerating the pace of emissions reductions, offsetting residual emissions, and creating the option for net negative CO2 emissions in case temperature reductions need to be achieved in the long term (high confidence). CDR options in the pathways are mostly limited to BECCS, afforestation and DACCS. CDR through some measures in AFOLU can be maintained for decades but not in the very long term because these sinks will ultimately saturate (high confidence). {3.4}  Mitigation pathways show reductions in energy demand relative to reference scenarios, through a  diverse  set  of  demand-side  interventions  (high  confidence).  Bottom-up  and  non-IAM  studies show  significant  potential  for  demand-side  mitigation.  A  stronger  emphasis  on  demand-side mitigation  implies  less  dependence  on  CDR  and,  consequently,  reduced  pressure  on  land  and biodiversity. {3.4, 3.7} Limiting warming requires shifting energy investments away from fossil-fuels and towards low-carbon  technologies  (high  confidence).  The  bulk  of  investments  are  needed  in  medium-  and  low-income  regions.  Investment  needs  in  the  electricity  sector  are  on  average  2.3  trillion  USD2015  yr-1 over  2023-2052  for  pathways  limiting  temperature  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot,  and  1.7 trillion USD2015 yr-1 for pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C. {3.6.1} likely  avoiding  overshoot  of  2°C  warming  require  more  rapid  near-term Pathways transformations and are associated with higher up-front transition costs, but meanwhile bring long-term gains for the economy as well as earlier benefits in avoided climate change impacts (high confidence). This conclusion is independent of the discount rate applied, though the modelled cost-optimal balance of mitigation action over time does depend on the discount rate. Lower discount rates favour earlier mitigation, reducing reliance on CDR and temperature overshoot. {3.6.1, 3.8} Mitigation pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C entail losses in global GDP with respect to reference  scenarios  of  between  1.3% and  2.7% in  2050;  and in  pathways  limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, losses are between 2.6% and 4.2%. Yet, these estimates do not account for the economic benefits of avoided climate change impacts  (medium confidence). In mitigation pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C, marginal abatement costs of carbon are about 90 (60-120) USD2015/tCO2 in 2030 and about 210 (140-340) USD2015/tCO2 in 2050; in pathways that  limit  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot,  they  are  about  220  (170-290) USD2015/tCO2 in 2030 and about 630 (430-990) USD2015/tCO2 in 20502. {3.6.1} The global benefits of pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C outweigh global mitigation costs over the 21st century, if aggregated economic impacts of climate change are at the moderate to high  end  of  the  assessed  range,  and  a  weight  consistent  with  economic  theory  is  given  to economic impacts  over  the  long-term.  This  holds true  even  without  accounting  for  benefits  in other  sustainable  development  dimensions  or  non-market  damages  from  climate  change (medium confidence). The aggregate global economic repercussions of mitigation pathways include the macroeconomic impacts of investments in low-carbon solutions and structural changes away from emitting  activities,  co-benefits  and  adverse  side  effects  of  mitigation,  (avoided)  climate  change impacts,  and  (reduced)  adaptation  costs.  Existing  quantifications  of  global  aggregate  economic Page 16
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII impacts  show  a  strong  dependence  on  socioeconomic  development  conditions,  as  these  shape exposure and vulnerability and adaptation opportunities and responses. (Avoided) impacts for poorer households  and  poorer  countries  represent  a  smaller  share  in  aggregate  economic  quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms, whereas their well-being and welfare effects are comparatively larger.  When  aggregate  economic  benefits  from  avoided  climate  change  impacts  are  accounted  for, mitigation is a welfare-enhancing strategy. (high confidence) {3.6.2} The economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action  can  be  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  mitigation  costs,  and  potentially  even  larger (medium confidence). {3.6.3} Differences  between  aggregate  employment  in  mitigation  pathways  compared  to  reference scenarios  are  relatively  small,  although  there  may  be  substantial  reallocations  across  sectors, with job creation in some sectors and job losses in others. The net employment effect (and its sign) depends on scenario assumptions, modelling framework, and modelled policy design. Mitigation has implications for employment through multiple channels, each of which impacts geographies, sectors and skill categories differently. (medium confidence){3.6.4} The economic repercussions of mitigation vary widely across regions and households, depending on  policy  design  and  level  of  international  cooperation(high  confidence).  Delayed  global cooperation  increases  policy  costs  across  regions,  especially  in  those  that  are  relatively  carbon intensive at present (high confidence). Pathways with uniform carbon values show higher mitigation costs in more carbon-intensive regions, in fossil-fuels exporting regions and in poorer regions (high confidence). Aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms undervalue the economic effects  on  households  in  poorer  countries;  the  actual  effects  on  welfare  and  well-being  are comparatively  larger  (high  confidence).  Mitigation  at  the  speed  and  scale  required  to  likely  limit warming  to  2°C  or  below  implies  deep  economic  and  structural  changes,  thereby  raising  multiple types of distributional concerns across regions, income classes and sectors (high confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.4} The  timing  of  mitigation  actions  and  their  effectiveness  will  have  significant  consequences  for broader  sustainable  development  outcomes  in  the  longer  term  (high  confidence).  Ambitious mitigation  can  be  considered  a  precondition  for  achieving  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals, especially for vulnerable populations and ecosystems with little capacity to adapt to climate impacts. Dimensions  with  anticipated  co-benefits  include  health,  especially  regarding  air  pollution,  clean energy access and water availability. Dimensions with potential trade-offs include food, employment, water stress, and biodiversity, which come under pressure from large-scale CDR deployment, energy affordability/access, and mineral resource extraction. (high confidence) {3.7} Many  of  the  potential  trade-offs  of  mitigation  measures  for  other  sustainable  development outcomes  depend  on  policy  design  and  can  thus  be  compensated  or  avoided  with  additional policies  and  investments  or  through  policies  that  integrate  mitigation  with  other  SDGs  (high confidence).  Targeted  SDG  policies  and  investments,  for  example  in  the  areas  of  healthy  nutrition, sustainable consumption and production, and international collaboration, can support climate change mitigation policies and resolve or alleviate trade-offs. Trade-offs can be addressed by complementary policies  and  investments,  as  well  as  through  the  design  of  cross-sectoral  policies  integrating mitigation with the Sustainable Development Goals of health, nutrition, sustainable consumption and production, equity and biodiversity.{3.7} Page 17
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Decent  living  standards,  which  encompass  many  SDG  dimensions,  are  achievable  at  lower energy  use  than  previously  thought(high  confidence).  Mitigation  strategies  that  focus  on  lower demands for energy and land-based resources exhibit reduced trade-offs and negative consequences for sustainable development relative to pathways involving either high emissions and climate impacts or those with high consumption and emissions that are ultimately compensated by large quantities of BECCS. {3.7} Different  mitigation  pathways  are  associated  with  different  feasibility  challenges,  though appropriate  enabling  conditions can  reduce  these challenges.  Feasibility challenges  are transient and  concentrated  in  the  next  two  to  three  decades  (high  confidence).   They  are  multi-dimensional, context-dependent and malleable to policy, technological and societal trends. {3.8}Mitigation  pathways  are  associated  with  significant  institutional  and  economic  feasibility challenges  rather  than  technological  and  geophysical.  The  rapid  pace  of  technological development  and  deployment  in  mitigation  pathways  is  not  incompatible  with  historical  records. Institutional capacity is rather a key limiting factor for a successful transition. Emerging economies appear to have highest feasibility challenges in the short to medium term. {3.8}Pathways  relying  on  a  broad  portfolio  of  mitigation  strategies  are  more  robust  and  resilient (high confidence). Portfolios of technological solutions reduce the feasibility risks associated with the low carbon transition. {3.8} 3-9  Total pages: 156Page 18
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII 3.1Introduction 3.1.1Assessment of mitigation pathways and their compatibility with long-term goals Chapter  3  takes  a  long-term  perspective  on  climate  change mitigation  pathways.  Its  focus  is  on the implications  of  long-term  targets  for  the  required  short-  and  medium-term  system  changes  and associated  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  This  focus  dictates  a  more  global  view  and  on  issues related  to  path-dependency  and  up-scaling  of  mitigation  options  necessary  to  achieve  different emissions  trajectories,  including  particularly  deep  mitigation  pathways  that  require  rapid  and fundamental changes.  Stabilizing global average temperature change requires to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero. Thus, a central  cross-cutting topic within  the  Chapter  is  the  timing  of  reaching  net zero  CO2  emissions  and how  a  “balance  between  anthropogenic  emissions  by  sources  and  removals  by  sinks”  could  be achieved across time and space. This includes particularly the increasing body of literature since the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C (SR1.5) which focuses on net zero CO2 emissions pathways that avoid temperature overshoot and hence do not rely on net negative CO2 emissions. The chapter conducts a systematic assessment of the associated economic costs as well as the benefits of mitigation  for  other  societal  objectives,  such  as  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  In addition, the Chapter builds on SR1.5 and introduces a new conceptual framing for the assessment of possible  social,  economic,  technical,  political,  and  geophysical  “feasibility”  concerns  of  alternative pathways, including the enabling conditions that would need to fall into place so that stringent climate goals become attainable.The  structure  of  the  Chapter  is  as  follows:  Section  3.2  introduces  different  types  of  mitigation pathways  as  well  as  the  available  modelling.  Section  3.3  explores  different  emissions  trajectories given  socio-economic  uncertainties  and  consistent  with  different  long-term  climate  outcomes.  A central element in this section is the systematic categorization of the scenario space according to key characteristics of the mitigation pathways (including e.g., global average temperature change, socio-economic  development,  technology  assumptions,  etc.).  In  addition,  the  section  introduces  selected Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) that are used across the whole report. Section 3.4 conducts a sectoral  analysis  of  the  mitigation  pathways,  assessing  the  pace  and  direction  of  systems  changes across sectors.  Among  others,  this section aims at  the  integration  of  the sectoral  information across WGIII  AR6  chapters  through  a  comparative  assessment  of  the  sectoral  dynamics  in  economy-wide systems  models  compared  to  the  insights  from  bottom-up  sectoral  models  (from  Chapters  6-11). Section 3.5 focuses on the required timing of mitigation actions, and implication of near-term choices for  the  attainability  of  a  range  of  long-term  climate  goals.  After  having  explored  the  underlying systems  transitions  and  the  required  timing  of  the  mitigation  actions,  Section  3.6  assesses  the economic  implications,  mitigation  costs  and  benefits;  and  Section  3.7  assesses  related  co-benefits, synergies,  and  possible  trade-offs  for  sustainable  development  and  other  societal  (non-climate) objectives.  Section  3.8  assumes  a  central  role  in  the  Chapter  and  introduces  a  multi-dimensional feasibility  metric  that  permits  the  evaluation  of  mitigation  pathways  across  a  range  of  feasibility concerns.  Finally,  methods  of  the  assessment  and  knowledge  gaps  are  discussed  in  Section  3.9, followed by Frequently Asked Questions.  3-10  Total pages: 156Page 19
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Within  the  overall  framing  of  the  AR6  report,  Chapter  3  and  Chapter  4  provide  important complementary views of the required systems transitions across different temporal and spatial scales. While Chapter 3 focuses on the questions concerning the implications of the long-term objectives for the medium-to-near-term transformations, Chapter 4 comes from the other direction, and focuses on current near-term trends and policies (such as the Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs) and their  consequences  with  regards  to  GHG  emissions.  The  latter  chapter  naturally  focuses  thus  much more on the regional and national dimensions, and the heterogeneity of current and planned policies. Bringing together the information from these two chapters enables the assessment of whether current and planned actions are consistent with the required systems changes for the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement.  Important other linkages comprise the collaboration with the “sectoral” Chapters 6-11 to provide an integrated cross-sectoral perspective. This information (including information also from the sectoral chapters) is taken up ultimately also by Chapter 5 on demand/services and Chapter 12 for a further assessment of sectoral potential and costs.  Linkages to other chapters exist also on the topic of feasibility, which are informed by the policy, the sectoral  and  the  demand  chapters,  the  technology  and  finance  chapters,  as  well  as  Chapter  4  on national circumstances. Close  collaboration  with  WGI  permitted  the  use  of  AR6-calibrated  emulators,  which  assure  full consistency across the different working groups. Linkages to WGII concern the assessment of macro-economic benefits of avoided impacts that are put into the context of mitigation costs as well as co-benefits and trade-offs for sustainable development. 3.1.3Complementary  use  of  large  scenario  ensembles  and  a  limited  set  of  Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) The  assessment  of  mitigation  pathways  explores  a  wide  scenario  space  from  the  literature  within which seven Illustrative Pathways (IPs) are explored. The overall process is indicated in Figure 3.5a.  For  a  comprehensive  assessment,  a  large  ensemble  of  scenarios  is  collected  and  made  available through an interactive AR6 scenario database. The collected information is shared across the chapters of AR6 and includes more than 3000 different pathways from a diverse set of studies. After an initial screening and quality control, scenarios were further vetted to assess if they sufficiently represented historical trends (Annex III). Subsequently, the climate consequences of each scenario were assessed using the climate emulator (leading to further classification). The assessment in Chapter 3 is however not limited to the scenarios from the database, and wherever necessary other literature sources are also assessed in order to bring together multiple lines of evidence.  3-11  Total pages: 156Page 20
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII START BOX HERE Box 3.1 Illustrative Mitigation Pathways The  literature  shows  a  wide  range  of  possible  emissions  trajectories,  depicting  developments  in  the absence of new climate policies or showing pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement. From the literature, a set of five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) was selected to denote implications of choices  on socio-economic  development and  climate policies, and  the  associated  transformations  of the main GHG emitting sectors (see Figure 3.5b). The IMPs include a set of transformative pathways that illustrates how choices may lead to distinctly different transformations that may keep temperature increase to below 2°C or 1.5°C. These pathways illustrate the implications of a focus on renewable energy such as solar and wind; reduced energy demand; extensive use of CDR in the energy and the industry  sectors  to  achieve  net  negative  emissions  and  reliance  on  other  supply-side  measures; strategies that avoid net-negative carbon emissions, and gradual strengthening. In addition, one IMP explores how climate policies consistent with keeping temperature to 1.5˚C can be combined with a broader shift towards sustainable development. These IMPs are used in various chapters, exploring for instance  their  implications  for  different  sectors,  regions,  and  innovation  characteristics  (see  Figure 3.5b). END BOX HERE 3.2What are mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals? 3.2.1Scenarios and emission pathways Scenarios and emission pathways are used to explore possible long-term trajectories, the effectiveness of possible mitigation strategies, and to help understand key uncertainties about the future. A scenario is  an  integrated  description  of  a  possible  future  of  the  human–environment  system  (Clarke  et  al. 2014),  and  could  be  a  qualitative  narrative,  quantitative  projection,  or  both.  Scenarios  typically capture  interactions  and  processes  driving  changes  in  key  driving  forces  such  as  population,  GDP, technology,  lifestyles,  and  policy,  and  the  consequences  on  energy  use,  land  use,  and  emissions. Scenarios  are  not  predictions  or  forecasts.  An  emission  pathway  is  a  modelled  trajectory  of anthropogenic emissions (Rogelj et al. 2018a) and, therefore, a part of a scenario. There is no unique or preferred method to develop scenarios, and future pathways can be developed from  diverse  methods,  depending  on  user  needs  and  research  questions  (Turnheim  et  al.  2015; Trutnevyte  et  al.  2019a;  Hirt  et  al.  2020).  The  most  comprehensive  scenarios  in  the  literature  are qualitative narratives that are translated into quantitative pathways using models (Clarke et al. 2014; Rogelj  et  al.  2018a).  Schematic  or  illustrative  pathways  can  also  be  used  to  communicate  specific features of more complex scenarios (Allen et al. 2018). Simplified models can be used to explain the mechanisms operating in more complex models (e.g., Emmerling et al. (2019)). Ultimately, a diversity of scenario and modelling approaches can lead to more robust findings (Gambhir et al. 2019; Schinko et al. 2017).  3-12  Total pages: 156Page 21
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII No-climate-policy reference scenarios have often been to compare with mitigation scenarios (Clarke et al.  2014).  A  no-climate-policy scenario assumes that  no  future climate  policies  are  implemented, beyond  what  is  in  the  model  calibration,  effectively  implying  that  the  carbon  price  is  zero.  No-climate-policy reference scenarios have a broad range depending on socioeconomic assumptions and model  characteristics,  and  consequently  are  important  when  assessing  mitigation  costs  (Riahi  et  al. 2017;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018b).  As  countries  move forward  with  climate  policies  of  varying  stringency, no-climate-policy  baselines  are  becoming  increasingly  hypothetical  (Hausfather  and  Peters  2020). Studies  clearly  show  current  policies  are  having  an  effect,  particularly  when  combined  with  the declining costs of low carbon technologies (IEA 2020a; UNEP 2020; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Sognnaes et  al.  2021),  and,  consequently,  realised  trajectories  begin  to  differ  from  earlier  no-climate-policy scenarios  (Burgess  et  al.  2020).  High-end  emission  scenarios,  such  as  RCP8.5  and  SSP5-8.5,  are becoming  less  likely  with  climate  policy  and  technology  change  (see  Box  3.3),  but  high-end concentration and warming levels may still be reached with the inclusion of strong carbon or climate feedbacks (Pedersen et al. 2020; Hausfather and Peters 2020).  3.2.1.2Mitigation scenarios Mitigation scenarios explore different strategies to meet climate goals and are typically derived from reference scenarios by adding climate or other policies. Mitigation pathways are  often developed to meet  a  predefined level  of  climate  change,  often referred to  as  a  backcast.  There  are relatively few IAMs  that  include  an  endogenous  climate  model  or  emulator  due  to  the  added  computational complexity, though exceptions do exist. In practice, models implement climate constraints by either iterating carbon price assumptions  (Strefler et al. 2021b) or by adopting an associated carbon budget (Riahi et al. 2021). In both cases, other GHGs are typically controlled by CO2-equivalent pricing. A large  part  of  the  AR5  literature  has  focused on  forcing  pathways towards  a target  at  the  end of  the century (van  Vuuren  et al.  2007,  2011;  Clarke  et  al. 2009;  Blanford  et  al.  2014;  Riahi et  al.  2017), featuring  a  temporary  overshoot  of  the  warming  and  forcing  levels  (Geden  and  Löschel  2017).  In comparison, many  recent  studies  explore mitigation strategies  that limit  overshoot  (Johansson et al. 2020;  Riahi  et  al.  2021).  An  increasing  number  of  IAM  studies  also  explore  climate  pathways  that limit adverse side-effects with respect to other societal objectives, such as food security (van Vuuren et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021) or larger sets of sustainability objectives (Soergel et al. 2021a).  3.2.2The utility of Integrated Assessment Models Integrated  Assessment  Models  (IAMs)  are  critical  for  understanding  the  implications  of  long-term climate  objectives  for  the  required  near-term  transition.  For  doing  so,  an  integrated  systems perspective  including  the  representation  of  all  sectors  and  GHGs  is  necessary.  IAMs  are  used  to explore  the  response  of  complex  systems  in  a  formal  and  consistent  framework.  They  cover  broad range  of  modelling  frameworks  (Keppo  et  al.  2021).  Given  the  complexity  of  the  systems  under investigation,  IAMs  necessarily  make  simplifying  assumptions  and  therefore  results  need  to  be interpreted in the context of these assumptions. IAMs can range from economic models that consider only carbon dioxide emissions through to detailed process-based representations of the global energy system,  covering  separate  regions  and  sectors  (such  as  energy,  transport,  and  land  use),  all  GHG emissions  and  air  pollutants,  interactions  with  land  and  water,  and  a  reduced  representation  of  the climate  system.  IAMs  are  generally  driven  by  economics  and  can  have  a  variety  of  characteristics such as partial-, general, or non-equilibrium, myopic or perfect foresight, be based on optimization or simulation, have exogenous or endogenous technological change, amongst many other characteristics. IAMs  take  as  input  socioeconomic  and  technical  variables  and  parameters  to  represent  various systems.  There  is  no  unique  way  to  integrate  this  knowledge  into  a  model,  and  due  to  their complexity,  various  simplifications  and  omissions  are  made  for  tractability.  IAMs  therefore  have various advantages and disadvantages which need to be weighed up when interpreting IAM outcomes. Annex III contains an overview of the different types of models and their key characteristics. 3-13  Total pages: 156Page 22
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Most  IAMs  are necessarily  broad as  they capture long-term  dynamics.  IAMs  are  strong in  showing the key characteristics of emission pathways and are most suited to questions related to short- versus long-term  trade-offs,  key  interactions  with  non-climate  objectives,  long-term  energy  and  land-use characteristics, and implications of different overarching technological and policy choices (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Clarke et al. 2014). While some IAMs have an high level of regional and sectoral detail, for questions that require higher levels of granularity (e.g., local policy implementation) specific region and sector models may be better suited. Utility of the IAM pathways increases when the quantitative results  are  contextualized  through  qualitative  narratives  or  other  additional  types  of  knowledge  to provide deeper insights (Geels et al. 2016a; Weyant 2017; Gambhir et al. 2019). IAMs have a long history in addressing environmental problems, particularly in the IPCC assessment process  (van  Beek  et  al.  2020).  Many  policy  discussions  have  been  guided  by  IAM-based quantifications,  such  as  the  required  emission  reduction  rates,  net  zero  years,  or  technology deployment rates required to meet certain climate outcomes. This has led to the  discussion whether IAM scenarios have become performative, meaning that they act upon, transform or bring into being the  scenarios  they  describe  (Beck  and  Mahony  2017,  2018).  Transparency  of  underlying  data  and methods is critical for scenario users to understand what drives different scenario results (Robertson 2020).  A  number  of  community  activities  have  thus  focused  on  the  provision  of  transparent  and publicly accessible databases of both input and output data (Riahi et al. 2012; Huppmann et al. 2018; Krey et al. 2019; Daioglou et al. 2020) as well as the provision of open-source code, and increased documentation  (Annex  III).  Transparency  is  needed  to  reveal  conditionality  of  results  on  specific choices  in  terms  of  assumptions  (e.g.,  discount  rates)  and  model  architecture.  More  detailed explanations of underlying model dynamics would be critical to increase the understanding of what drives results (Bistline et al. 2020; Butnar et al. 2020; Robertson 2020).  Mitigation  scenarios  developed  for  a  long-term  climate  constraint  typically  focus  on  cost-effective mitigation  action  towards  a  long-term  climate  goal.  Results  from  IAM  as  well  as  sectoral  models depend  on  model  structure  (Mercure  et  al.  2019),  economic  assumptions  (Emmerling  et  al.  2019), technology  assumptions  (Pye  et  al.  2018),  climate/emissions  target  formulation  (Johansson  et  al. 2020), and the extent to which pre-existing market distortions are considered (Guivarch et al. 2011). The  vast  majority  of  IAM  pathways  do  not  consider  climate  impacts  (Schultes  et  al.  2021).  Equity hinges  upon  ethical  and  normative  choices.  As  most  IAM  pathways  follow  the  cost-effectiveness approach, they do not make any additional equity assumptions. Notable exceptions include (Tavoni et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017; van den Berg et al. 2020; Bauer et al. 2020). Regional IAM results need thus to be assessed with care, considering that emissions reductions are happening where it is most cost-effective, which needs to be separated from the fact who is ultimately paying for the mitigation costs. Cost-effective pathways can provide a useful benchmark, but may not reflect real-world developments (Trutnevyte  2016;  Calvin  et  al.  2014a).  Different  modelling  frameworks  may  lead  to  different outcomes (Mercure et al. 2019). Recent studies have shown that other desirable outcomes can evolve with  only  minor  deviations  from  cost-effective  pathways  (Neumann  and  Brown  2021;  Bauer  et  al. 2020).  IAM  and  sectoral  models  represent  social,  political,  and  institutional  factors  only  in  a rudimentary  way.  This  assessment  is  thus  relying  on  new  methods  for  the  ex-post  assessment  of feasibility  concerns  (Jewell  and  Cherp  2020;  Brutschin  et  al.  2021).  A  literature  is  emerging  that recognises  and  reflects  on  the  diversity  and  strengths/weaknesses  of  model-based  scenario  analysis (Keppo et al. 2021). 3-14  Total pages: 156Page 23

Many  factors  influence  the  deployment  of  technologies  in  the  IAMs.  Since  AR5,  there  has  been fervent  debate  on  the  large-scale  deployment  of  Bioenergy  with  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage (BECCS) in scenarios (Geden 2015; Fuss et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016; Anderson and Peters 2016; van  Vuuren  et al.  2017;  Galik  2020;  Köberle  2019). Hence,  many recent  studies  explore  mitigation pathways with limited BECCS deployment (Grubler et al. 2018; Soergel et al. 2021a; van Vuuren et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). While some have argued that technology diffusion in IAMs occurs too rapidly (Gambhir et al. 2019), others argued that most models prefer large-scale solutions resulting in a  relatively  slow  phase-out  of  fossil  fuels  (Carton  2019).  While  IAMs  are  particularly  strong  on supply-side representation, demand-side measures still lag in detail of representation despite progress since AR5 (Grubler et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019; Lovins et al. 2019; O’Neill et al. 2020b; Hickel  et  al.  2021;  Keyßer  and  Lenzen  2021).  The  discount  rate  has  a  significant  impact  on  the balance between near-term and long-term mitigation. Lower discount rates <4% (than used in IAMs) may  lead  to  more  near-term  emissions  reductions  –  depending  on  the  stringency  of  the  target (Emmerling et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). Models often use simplified policy assumptions (O’Neill et al.  2020b)  which  can  affect  the  deployment  of  technologies  (Sognnaes  et  al.  2021).  Uncertainty  in technologies  can  lead to  more  or  less  short-term mitigation  (Grant  et  al.  2021; Bednar et al.  2021). There  is  also  a  recognition  to  put  more  emphasis  on  what  drives  the  results  of  different  IAMs (Gambhir et al. 2019) and suggestions to focus more on what is driving differences in result across IAMs  (Nikas  et  al.  2021).  As  noted  by  Weyant  (2017)  (p.131),  “IAMs  can  provide  very  useful information,  but  this  information  needs  to  be  carefully  interpreted  and  integrated  with  other quantitative and qualitative inputs in the decision-making process.”  3.2.3The scenario literature and scenario databases IPCC  reports  have  often  used  voluntary  submissions  to  a  scenario  database  in  its  assessments.  The database  is  an  ensemble  of  opportunity,  as  there  is  not  a  well-designed  statistical  sampling  of  the hypothetical  model  or  scenario  space:  the  literature  is  unlikely  to  cover  all  possible  models  and scenarios,  and  not  all  scenarios  in  the  literature  are  submitted  to  the  database.  Model  inter-comparisons are often the core of scenario databases assessed by the IPCC (Cointe et al. 2019; Nikas et  al.  2021).  Single  model  studies  may  allow  more  detailed  sensitivity  analyses  or  address  specific research questions. The scenarios that are organised within the scientific community are more likely to enter the assessment process via the scenario database (Cointe et al. 2019), while scenarios from different communities, in the emerging literature, or not structurally consistent with the database may be  overlooked.  Scenarios  in  the  grey  literature  may  not  be  assessed  even  though  they  may  have greater weight in a policy context.  3-15  Total pages: 156Page 24
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII (Burgess  et  al.  2020).  As  a  result,  the  SSPs  require  updating  (O’Neill  et  al.  2020b).  Most  of  the scenarios  in  the  AR6  database  are  SSP-based  and  consider  various  updates  compared  to  the  first release (Riahi et al. 2017).  3.2.4The AR6 scenario database To  facilitate  this  assessment,  a  large  ensemble  of  scenarios  has  been  collected  and  made  available through  an  interactive  WGIII  AR6  scenario  database.  The  collection  of  the  scenario  outputs  is coordinated  by  Chapter  3  and  expands  upon  the  IPCC  SR1.5  scenario  explorer  (Huppmann  et  al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a). A complementary database for national pathways has been established by Chapter 4. Annex III contains full details on how the scenario database was compiled. The AR6 scenario database contains 3131 scenarios (see Figure 3.5a). After an initial screening and quality control, scenarios were further vetted to assess if they sufficiently represented historical trends (Annex III). Of the initial 2266 scenarios with global scope, 1686 scenarios passed the vetting process and are assessed in this Chapter. The scenarios that did not pass the vetting are still available in the database.  The  vetted  scenarios  were  from  over  50  different  model  families,  or  over  100  when considering  all  versions  of  the  same  family  (Figure  3.1).  The  scenarios  originated  from  over  15 different model intercomparison projects, with very few scenarios originating from individual studies (Figure  3.2).  Because  of  the  uneven  distribution  of  scenarios  from  different  models  and  projects, uncorrected statistics from the database can be misleading.  3-16  Total pages: 156Page 25
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Figure 3.2 Scenario counts from each named project. Each scenario with sufficient data is given a temperature classification using climate model emulators. Three emulators were used in the assessment: FAIR (Smith et al. 2018), CICERO-SCM (Skeie et al. 2021), MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2020). Only the results of MAGICC are shown in this chapter as it  adequately  covers  the  range  of  outcomes.  The  emulators  are  calibrated  against  the  behaviour  of complex climate models and observation data, consistent with the outcomes of AR6 WGI AR6 (WGI cross-chapter Box 7.1). The climate assessment is a three-step process of harmonization, infilling and a probabilistic climate model emulator run (Annex III.2.5.1). Warming projections until the year 2100 were derived for 1574 scenarios, of which 1202 passed vetting, with the remaining scenarios having insufficient information (Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3). For scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or below, the SR15 classification was adopted in AR6, with more disaggregation provided for higher warming levels  (Table  3.1).  These  choices  can  be  compared  with  the  selection  of  common  global  warming levels (GWL) of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C to classify climate change impacts in the WGII assessment.  3-17  Total pages: 156Page 26

In addition to the temperature classification, each scenario is assigned to one of the following policy categories: (P0) diagnostic scenarios – 100 of 1686 vetted scenarios; (P1) scenarios with no globally coordinated  policy  and  either  (P1a)  no  climate  mitigation  efforts  –  119,  (P1b)  current  national mitigation efforts – 59, (P1c) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – 110, or (P1d) other non-standard  assumptions  –  104;  (P2)  globally  coordinated  climate  policies  with  immediate  (i.e.  before 2030) action – 73, (P2a) without any transfer of emission permits – 435, (P2b) with transfers – 70; or (P2c)  with  additional  policy  assumptions  –  55;  (P3)  globally  coordinated  climate  policies  with delayed (i.e. from 2030 onwards or after 2030) action, preceded by (P3a) no mitigation commitment or  current  national  policies  –  7,  (P3b)  NDCs  –  376,  (P3c)  NDCs  and  additional  policies  –  18  and (P3d) other non-standard regional assumptions – 0; (P4) Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) – 2. The policy categories were identified using text pattern matching on the scenario metadata and calibrated on the best-known  scenarios  from  model  intercomparisons,  with  further  validation  against  the  related literature,  reported  emission  and  carbon  price  trajectories,  and  exchanges  with  modellers.  If  the information  available  is  enough  to  qualify  a  policy  category  number  but  not  sufficient  for  a subcategory, then only the number is retained (e.g., P2 instead of P2a/b/c). A suffix added after P0 further  qualifies  a  diagnostic  scenario  as  one  of  the  other  policy  categories.To  demonstrate  the diversity  of  the  scenarios,  the  vetted  scenarios  were  classified  into  different  categories  along  the dimensions  of  population,  GDP,  energy,  and  cumulative  emissions  (Figure  3.4).    The  number  of scenarios in each category provides some insight into the current literature, but this does not indicate a higher probability of that category occurring in reality. For population, the majority of scenarios are consistent with the SSP2 ‘middle of the road’ category, with very few scenarios exploring the outer 3-18  Total pages: 156Page 27

The  level  of  CCS  and  CDR  is  expected  to  change  depending  on  the extent  of  mitigation,  but  there  remains  extensive  use  of  both  CDR  and  CCS  in  scenarios.  CDR  is dominated by bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and sequestration on land, with relatively few scenarios using  Direct  Air  Capture  with  Carbon  Storage  (DACCS)  and  even  less  with  Enhanced  Weathering and other technologies (not shown). In terms of energy consumption, final energy has a much smaller range than primary energy as conversion losses are not included in final energy. Both mitigation and reference scenarios are shown, so there is a broad spread in different energy carriers represented in the database.  Bioenergy  has  a  number  of  scenarios  at  around  100EJ,  representing  a  constraint  used  in many model intercomparisons.  Figure 3.4 Histograms for key categories in the AR6 scenario database. Only scenarios that passed vetting are shown. For population and GDP, the SSP input data are also shown. The grey shading represents the 0-100% range (light grey), 25-75% range (dark grey), and the median is a black line. The figures with white areas are outside of the scenario range, but the axis limits are retained to allow comparability with other categories. Each subfigure potentially has different x- and y-axis limits. Each figure also potentially contains different numbers of scenarios, depending on what was submitted to the database.

In  WGIII,  IMPs  were  selected  to  denote  the  implications  of  different  societal  choices  for  the development of future emissions and associated transformations of main GHG emitting sectors (see Box  3.1  and  Figure  3.5a). The  most important  function  of the  IMPs is to  illustrate  key  themes that 3-19  Total pages: 156Page 28
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII form a common thread in the report, both with a storyline and a quantitative illustration. The storyline describes  the  key  characteristics  that  define  an  IMP. The  quantitative  versions of  the  IMPs  provide numerical  values  that  are  internally  consistent  and  comparable  across  chapters  of  the  report.  The quantitative  IMPs  have  been  selected  from  the  AR6  scenario  database.  No  assessment  of  the likelihood of each IMP has been made. The  selected  scenarios  (IPs)  are  divided  into  two  sets  (Figure  3.5  and  Figure  3.6):  two  reference pathways  illustrative  of  high  emissions  and  five  Illustrative  Mitigation  Pathways  (IMPs).  The narratives are explained in full in Annex III. The two reference pathways explore the consequences of current policies and pledges: Current Policies (CurPol) and Moderate Action (ModAct). The CurPol pathway explores the consequences of continuing along the path of implemented climate policies in 2020  and  only  a  gradual  strengthening  after  that.  The  scenario  illustrates  the  outcomes  of  many scenarios in the literature that project the outcomes of current policies. The ModAct pathway explores the impact of implementing the Nationally Determined Contributions as formulated in 2020 and some further strengthening after that. In line with current literature, these two reference pathways lead to an increase in global mean temperature of more than 2°C (see Section 3.3). The Illustrative Mitigation Pathways properly explore different pathways consistent with meeting the long-term  temperature  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  They  represent  five  different  pathways  that emerge  from  the  overall  assessment.  The  IMPs  consist  of  pathways  with:  gradual  strengthening  of current policies (GS), extensive use of net negative emissions (Neg), renewables (Ren), low demand (LD), and shifting pathways (SP).  Each of these pathways can be implemented with different levels of ambition. In the IMP framework, GS is consistent with staying likely below 2°C (C3), Neg shows a strategy that also stays likely below 2°C level but returns to nearly 1.5°C by the end of the century (hence indicated as C2*). The other variants that can limit warming to 1.5°C (C1) were selected. In addition to these IMPs, sensitivity cases that explore alternative warming levels (C3) for Neg and Ren are assessed (Neg-2.0 and Ren-2.0). 3-20  Total pages: 156Page 29

The mitigation strategies show the different options in emission reduction (Figure 3.7). Each panel shows the key characteristics leading to total GHG emissions, consisting of residual (gross) emissions (fossil CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions from industrial processes, and non-CO2 emissions) and removals (net land-use change, bioenergy with carbon  capture  and  storage,  and  direct  air  carbon  capture  and  storage),  in  addition  to  avoided emissions through the use of carbon capture and storage on fossil fuels. The Neg and GS scenarios were  shown  to  illustrate  scenarios  with  a  significant  role  of  CDR.  The  energy  supply  (Figure  3.8) shows the phase-out of fossil fuels in the LD, Ren and SP cases, but a less substantial decrease in the Neg  case.  The  GS  case  needs  to  make  up  its  slow  start  by  1)  rapid  reductions  mid-century  and  2) massive reliance on net negative emissions by the end of the century. The CurPol and ModAct cases both  result  in  relatively  high  emissions,  showing  a  slight  increase  and  stabilization  compared  to current emissions, respectively. 3-22  Total pages: 156Page 31

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII 3.3Emission  pathways,  including  socio-economic,  carbon  budget  and climate responses uncertainties 3.3.1Socio-economic drivers of emissions scenarios Greenhouse  gas  emissions  mainly  originate  from  the  use  and  transformation  of  energy,  agriculture, land use (change) and industrial activities. The future development of these sources is influenced by trends in socio-economic development, including population, economic activity, technology, politics, lifestyles, and  climate policy.  Trends for  these factors  are  not  independent,  and  scenarios  provide a consistent outlook for these factors together (see Section 3.2). Marangoni et al. (2017) show that in projections, assumptions influencing energy intensity (e.g., structural change, lifestyle and efficiency) and  economic  growth  are  the  most  important  determinants  of  future  CO2  emissions  from  energy combustion. Other critical factors include technology assumptions, preferences, resource assumptions and  policy  (van  Vuuren  et  al.  2008).  As  many  of  the  factors  are  represented  differently  in  specific models, the model itself is also an important factor – providing a reason for the importance of model diversity  (Sognnaes  et  al.  2021).  For  land  use,  Stehfest  et  al.  (2019)  show  that  assumptions  on population  growth  are  more  dominant  given  that  variations  in  per  capita  consumption  of  food  are smaller than for energy. Here, we only provide a brief overview of some key drivers. We focus first on so-called reference scenarios (without stringent climate policy) and look at mitigation scenarios in detail later. We use the SSPs to discuss trends in more detail. The SSPs were published in 2017, and by now, some elements will have to be updated (O’Neill et al. 2020b). Still, the ranges represent the full literature relatively well. Historically,  population  and  GDP  have  been  growing  over  time.  Scenario  studies  agree  that  further global population growth is likely up to 2050, leading to a range of possible outcomes of around 8.5-11 billion people (see Figure 3.9). After 2050, projections show a much wider range. If fertility drops below replacement levels, a decline in the global population is possible (as illustrated by SSP1 and SSP5).  This  typically  includes  scenarios  with  rapid  development  and  investment  in  education. However, median projections mostly show a stabilisation of the world population (e.g., SSP2), while high-end  projections  show  a  continued  growth  (e.g.,  SSP3).  The  UN  Population  Prospects  include considerably higher values for both the medium projection and the high end of the range than the SSP scenarios (KC and Lutz 2017; UN 2019). The most recent median UN projection reaches almost 11 billion people in 2100. The key differences are in Africa and China: here, the population projections are  strongly  influenced  by  the  rate  of  fertility  change  (faster  drop  in  SSPs).  Underlying,  the  UN approach  is  more  based  on  current  demographic  trends  while  the  SSPs  assume  a  broader  range  of factors (including education) driving future fertility. 3-24  Total pages: 156Page 33
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII represents an example of the opposite – while SSP2 and SSP4 are placed more in the middle. Nearly all scenarios assessed here do not account for climate impacts on growth (mostly for methodological reasons).  As  discussed  in  Section  3.5  these  impacts  can  be  considerable.  An  emerging  area  of literature emphasises the possibility of stabilisation (or even decline) of income levels in developed countries,  arguing  that  such  a  trend  would  be  preferred  or  even  needed  for  environmental  reasons (Anderson  and  Larkin  2013;  Kallis  et  al.  2020;  Hickel  and  Kallis  2020;  Keyßer  and  Lenzen  2021; Hickel et al. 2021) (see also Chapter 5). Such scenarios are not common among IAM outcomes, that are more commonly based on the idea that decarbonisation can be combined with economic growth by a combination of technology, lifestyle and structural economic changes. Still, such scenarios could result in a dramatic reduction of energy and resource consumption (see further). Scenarios  show  a  range  of  possible  energy  projections.  In  the  absence  of  climate  policy,  most scenarios  project  the  final  energy  demand  to  continue  to  grow  to  around  650-800  EJ  yr-1  in  2100 (based on the scenario database). Some projections show a very high energy demand up to 1000 EJ yr-1  (comparable  to  SSP5).  The  scenario  of  the  IEA  lies  within  the  SSP  range  but  near  the  SSP1 projection.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  IEA  scenario  includes  current  policies  (most reference scenarios do not) and many scenarios published before 2021 did not account for the Covid-19 crisis.

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII economic growth in the literature, mainly in developed countries (Kemp-Benedict 2018) (decoupling here refers to either a much slower increase in demand or even a decrease). In the scenario literature, this  is  reflected  by  scenarios  with  very  low  demand  for  final  energy  based  on  increased  energy efficiency and less energy-intensive lifestyles (e.g., SSP1 and the LED scenario) (Grubler et al. 2018; van  Vuuren  et  al.  2018).  While  these  studies  show  the  feasibility  of  such  pathways,  their  energy efficiency improvement  rates  are  considerably  above the  historic range  of  around  2%  (Haberl  et  al. 2020). (Vrontisi  et  al.  2018;  Roelfsema  et  al.  2020;  Sognnaes  et  al.  2021)(IEA  2021a;  Höhne  et  al. 2021)(Jeffery et al. 2018; Gütschow et al. 2018)(Giarola et al. 2021)(Sognnaes et al. 2021)(Höhne et al. 2021)(Höhne et al. 2021)These scenarios also show clear differences in food consumption and the amount of land used for agriculture. Food demand in terms of per capita caloric intake is projected to increase  in  most  scenarios.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  there  are  large  differences  in  dietary composition across the scenarios  (from more meat-intensive in scenarios like SSP5 to a decrease in meat consumptions in other scenarios such as SSP1). Land use projections also depend on assumed changes  in  yield  and  the  population  scenarios.  Typically,  changes  in  land  use  are  less  drastic  than some  other  parameters  (in  fact,  the  5-95th  database  range  is  almost  stable).  Agriculture  land  is projected  to  increase  in  SSP3,  SSP2,  and  SSP4  –  more-or-less  stable  in  SSP5  and  is  projected  to decline in SSP1. 3.3.2Emission pathways and temperature outcomes 3.3.2.1Overall mitigation profiles and temperature consequences Figure  3.10  shows  the  GHG  and  CO2  emission  trajectories  for  different  temperature  categories  as defined in Section 3.2 (the temperature levels are calculated using simple climate models, consistent with  the  outcomes  of  the  recent  WGI  assessment,  Cross-Chapter  Box  7.1).  It  should  be  noted  that most scenarios currently in the literature do not account for an impact of Covid-19 (see Box 3.2). The higher categories (C6 and C7) mostly included scenarios with no or modest climate policy.  Because of the progression of climate policy, it is becoming more common that reference scenarios incorporate implemented climate policies. Modelling studies typically implement current or pledged policies up until  2030  (Vrontisi  et  al.  2018;  Roelfsema  et  al.  2020;  Sognnaes  et  al.  2021)  with  some  studies focusing also on the policy development in the long term (IEA 2021a; Höhne et al. 2021). (Jeffery et al. 2018; Gütschow et al. 2018)Based on the assessment by Chapter 4, reference pathways consistent with  the  implementation  and  extrapolation  of  current  policies  are  associated  with  increased  GHG emissions  from  59  (53-65)  GtCO2-eq  yr-1  in  2019  to  52-60  GtCO2-eq  yr-1  by  2030  and  to  46-67 GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2050 (see Figure 3.6). Pathways with these near-term emissions characteristics, lead to  a  median  global  warming  of  2.4°C  to  3.5°C  by  2100  (see  also  further  in  this  section).  These pathways  consider  policies  at  the  time  that  they  were  developed.  A  recent  model  comparison  that harmonised socioeconomic, technological, and policy assumptions (Giarola et al. 2021) found a 2.2-2.9°C median temperature rise in 2100 for current and stated policies, with the results sensitive to the model used and the method of implementing policies (Sognnaes et al. 2021). Scenario inference and construction methods using similar policy assumptions leads to a median range of 2.9-3.2°C in 2100 for current policies and 2.4-2.9°C in 2100 for 2030 pledges (Höhne et al. 2021). The median spread of 1°C  across  these  studies  (2.2-3.2°C)  indicates  the  deep  uncertainties  involved  with  modelling temperature outcomes of 2030 policies through to 2100. (Höhne et al. 2021) The  lower  categories  include  increasingly  stringent  assumed  climate  policies.  For  all  scenario categories, except the highest category, emissions peak in the 21st century. For the lowest categories, the  emissions  peak  is  mostly  before  2030.  In  fact,  for  scenarios  in  the  category  that  avoids temperature  overshoot  for the 1.5oC  scenario (C1  category),  GHG  emissions  are  reduced  already  to almost zero around the middle of the century. Typically, CO2 emissions reach net zero about 10-20 years before total GHG emissions reach net zero. The main reason is that scenarios reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions less than CO2 due to a limited mitigation potential (see 3.3.2.2). The figure also  shows  that  many  scenarios  in  the  literature  with  a  temperature  outcome  below  2  °C  show  net 3-26  Total pages: 156Page 35
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII negative  emissions.  There  are,  however,  also  exceptions  in  which  more  immediate  emission reductions  limits  the  need  for  CDR.  The  IMPs  illustrate  alternative  pathways  to  reach  the  C1-C3 temperature levels. START BOX HERE Box 3.2 Impact of Covid-19 on long-term emissions The reduction in CO2 emissions of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 was estimated to be about 6% (see section 4.2.2.4 and Table S4.2) lower than 2019 levels  (BP 2021, Crippa et al. 2021, IEA 2021, Le Quéré  et  al.  2021;  Friedlingstein  et  al.  2020;  Forster  et  al.  2020;  Liu  et  al.  2020c).  Near-real-time monitoring  estimates  show  a  rebound  in  emissions  levels,  meaning  2021  emissions  levels  are expected to be higher than 2020 (Le Quéré et al. 2021). The longer-term effects are uncertain but so far do not indicate a clear structural change for climate policy related to the pandemic. The increase in renewable shares in 2020 could stimulate a further transition, but slow economic growth can also slow down  (renewable)  energy  investments.  Also,  lifestyle  changes  during  the  crisis  can  still  develop  in different directions (working from home, but maybe also living further away from work). Without a major  intervention,  most  long-term  scenarios  project  that  emission  will  start  to  follow  a  similar pathway  as  earlier  projections  (although  at  a  reduced  level)  (IEA  2020b;  Kikstra  et  al.  2021a; Rochedo  et  al.  2021).  If  emissions  reductions  are  limited  to  only  a  short  time,  the  adjustment  of pathways  will  lead  to  negligible  outcomes  in  the  order  of  0.01K  (Forster  et  al.  2020;  Jones  et  al. 2021). At the same time, however, the large amount of investments pledged in the recovery packages could provide a unique opportunity to determine the long-term development of infrastructure, energy systems  and  land  use  (Hepburn  et  al.  2020;  Pianta  et  al.  2021;  Andrijevic  et  al.  2020b).  Near-term alternative  recovery  pathways  have  been  shown  to  have  the  potential  to  influence  carbon  price pathways, and energy investments and electrification requirements under stringent mitigation targets (Kikstra et al. 2021a; Rochedo et al. 2021; Bertram et al. 2021; Pollitt et al. 2021; Shan et al. 2021). Most  studies  suggest  a  noticeable  reduction  in  2030  emissions.  However,  much  further  reductions would be needed to reach the emission levels consistent with mitigation scenarios that would likely stay below 2oC or lower (see Chapter 4). At the moment, the share of investments in greenhouse gas reduction is relatively small in most recovery packages, and no structural shifts for climate policies are observed linked to the pandemic. Finally, most of the scenarios analysed in this Chapter do not include the 2020 emissions reduction related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on  the  pathways  will  likely  be  very  small.  The  assessment  of  climate  mitigation  pathways  in  this chapter should be interpreted as being almost exclusively based on the assumption of a fast recovery with limited persistent effects on emissions or structural changes. 3-27  Total pages: 156Page 36

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII END BOX HERE Figure 3.11: Global mean temperature outcome of the ensemble of scenarios included in the climate categories C1-C7 (based on RCM calibrated to the WGI assessment, both in terms of future and historic warming). The left panel shows the ranges of scenario uncertainty (shaded area) with the P50 RCM probability (line). The right panel shows the P5 to P95 range of RCM climate uncertainty (C1-C7 is explained in Table 3.1) and the P50 (line) and P66 (dashed line). Figure  3.11  shows  the  possible  consequences  of  the  different  scenario  categories  for  global  mean temperature  calculated  using  a  reduced  complexity  model  calibrated  to  the  IPCC  WGI  assessment (see  Annex  III  and  WGI  report).  For  the  C5-C7  categories  (containing  most  of  the  reference  and current policy scenarios), the global mean temperature is expected to increase throughout the century (and further increase will happen after 2100 for C6 and C7). While warming would likely be in the range from 2.2-3.8  °C – warming above 5°C cannot be excluded. The highest emissions scenarios in the  literature  combine  assumptions  about  rapid  long-term  economic  growth  and  pervasive  climate policy failures, leading to a reversal of some recent trends (see box 3.3). For the categories C1-C4, a peak in global mean temperature is reached mid-century for most scenarios in the database, followed by  a  small  (C3/C4)  or  more  considerable  decline  (C1/C2).  There  is  a  clear  distinction  between  the scenarios with no or limited overshoot (typically <0.1 °C, C1) compared to those with high overshoot (C2): in emissions, the C1 category is characterised by steep early reductions and a relatively small contribution of net negative emissions (like LD and Ren) (Figure 3.10). In addition to the temperature caused by the range of scenarios in each category (main panel), also climate uncertainties contribute to  a  range  of  temperature  outcomes  (including  uncertainties  regarding  the  carbon  cycle,  climate sensitivity,  and  the  rate  of  change,  see  WGI).  The  bars  on  the  right  of  Figure  3.11  show  the uncertainty  range  for  each  category  (combining  scenario  and  uncertainty).  While  the  C1  category more  likely  than  not  leads  to  warming  below  1.5  °C  by  the  end  of  the  century,  even  with  such  a scenario,  warming  above  2oC  cannot  be  excluded  (95th  percentile).  The  uncertainty  range  for  the highest emission categories (C7) implies that these scenarios could lead to a warming above 6oC.  3.3.2.2The role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases The trajectory of future CO2 emissions plays a critical role in mitigation, given CO2 long-term impact and  dominance  in  total  greenhouse  gas  forcing.  As  shown  in  Figure  3.12,  CO2  dominates  total greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  high  emissions  scenarios  but  is  also  reduced  most,  going  from scenarios in the highest to lower categories. In C4 and below, most scenarios exhibit net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century compensating for some of the residual emissions of non-CO2  gases  as  well  as  reducing  overall  warming  from  an  intermediate  peak.  Still,  early  emission 3-29  Total pages: 156Page 38
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII reductions  and  further  reductions  in  non-CO2  emissions  can  also  lead  to  scenarios  without  net negative emissions in 2100, even in C1 and C3 (shown for the 85-95th percentile). In C1, avoidance of significant  overshoot  implies  that  immediate  gross  reductions  are  more  relevant  than  long-term  net negative  emissions  (explaining  the  lower  number  than  in  C2)  but  carbon  dioxide  removal  is  still playing a role in compensating for remaining positive emissions in hard-to-abate sectors.  3-30  Total pages: 156Page 39
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) also play an important role in climate change, certainly for short-term changes (see Figure SPM.2, WGI) (Shindell et al. 2012). These forcers consist of 1) substances contributing  to  warming,  such  as  methane,  black  carbon  and  tropospheric  ozone  and  2)  substances contributing to cooling (other aerosols, such as related to sulphur emissions). Most SLCFs are also air pollutants,  and  reducing  their  emissions  provides  additional  co-benefits  (Shindell  et  al.  2017a,b; Hanaoka  and  Masui  2020).  In  the  case  of  the  first  group,  emission  reduction  thus  leads  to  both  air pollution and climate benefits. For the second, group there is a possible trade-off (Shindell and Smith 2019; Lund et al. 2020). As aerosol emissions are mostly associated with fossil fuel combustion, the benefits  of  reducing  CO2  could,  in  the  short  term,  be  reduced  as  a  result  of  lower  aerosol  cooling. There has been an active discussion on the exact climate contribution of SLCF focused policies in the literature.  This  discussion  partly  emerged  from  different  assumptions  on  possible  reductions  in  the absence  of  ambitious  climate  policy  and  the  uncertain  global  climate  benefit  from  aerosol  (black carbon) (Rogelj et al. 2014). The latter is now assessed to be smaller than originally thought (Smith et al.  2020b;  Takemura  and  Suzuki  2019)  (see  also  WGI  Chapter  6,  Section  6.4).  Reducing  SLCF emissions is critical to meet long-term climate goals and might help reduce the rate of climate change in  the  short  term.  Deep  SLCF  emission  reductions  also  increase  the  remaining  carbon  budget  for  a specific temperature goal (Rogelj et al. 2015a; Reisinger et al. 2021) (see Box 3.4). A more detailed discussion can be found in WGI Chapter 5 and 6. For  accounting  of  emissions  and  the  substitution  of  different  gases  as  part  of  a  mitigation  strategy, typically, emission metrics are used to compare the climate impact of different gases. Most policies currently  use  Global  Warming  Potentials  with  a  100-year  time  horizon  as  this  is  also  mandated for emissions  reporting  in  the  Paris  Rulebook  (for  a  wider  discussion  of  GHG  metrics,  see  Box  2.2  in Chapter  2  and  WGI,  Chapter  7,  Section  7.6).  Alternative  metrics  have  also  been  proposed,  such  as those  using  a  shorter  or  longer  time  horizon  or  those  that  focus  directly  on  the  consequences  of reaching a certain temperature target (Global Temperature Change Potential, GTP), allowing a more direct comparison with cumulative CO2 emissions (Allen et al. 2016; Lynch et al. 2020) or focusing on damages (Global Damage Potential) (an overview is given in Chapter 2,  and Cross-Chapter Box 3). Depending on the metric, the value attributed to reducing short-lived forcers like methane can be lower  in the  near term  (e.g.,  in the  case  of  GTP)  or higher  (GWP  with short reference  period).  For most metrics, however, the impact on mitigation strategies is relatively small, among others, due to the  marginal  abatement  cost  curve  of  methane  (low  costs  for  low  to  medium  mitigation  levels; expensive for high levels). The timing of reductions across different gases impacts warming and the co-benefits (Harmsen et al. 2016; Cain et al. 2019). Nearly all scenarios in the literature use GWP-100 in cost-optimisation, reflecting the existing policy approach; the use of GWP-100 deviates from cost-optimal mitigation pathways by at most a few percent for temperature goals of likely below 2°C and lower (see Box 2.2 in Chapter 2).  3-31  Total pages: 156Page 40
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII START BOX HERE Box 3.4 Consistency of remaining carbon budgets in the WGI assessment and cumulative CO2 emissions in WGIII mitigation pathways Introduction The  WGI  assessment  has  shown  that  the  increase  in  global  mean  temperature  has  a  near-linear relationship with cumulative CO2 emissions (Chapter 5, Section 5.5, Box 5.3). Consistently, WGI has confirmed  that  net  zero  CO2  emissions  are required to  halt  CO2-induced  warming.  This  permits  the estimation of carbon budgets consistent with specific temperature goals. In Chapter 3, we present the temperature  outcomes  and  cumulative  CO2  emissions  associated  with  different  warming  levels  for around  1200  scenarios  published  in  the  literature  and  which  were  classified  according  to  different warming levels (see Section 3.2 and Annex III, Part II.2.5). In this box, we discuss the consistency of the  assessments  presented  here  and  in  IPCC  WGI.  The  box  summarises  how  the  remaining  carbon budgets assessed by WGI relate to the remaining cumulative CO2 emissions until the time of net zero CO2 emissions in mitigation pathways (Table 3.2, Table SPM1) assessed by WGIII.  In its assessment, WGI uses a framework in which the various components of the remaining carbon budget are informed by various lines of evidence and assessed climate system characteristics. WGIII, instead, uses around 1200 emission scenarios with estimated warming levels that cover the scenario range presented in WGI but also contain many more intermediate projections with varying emission profiles  and  a  combination  of  CO2  emissions  and  other  greenhouse  gases.  In  order  to  assess  their climate outcomes, climate model emulators are used. The emulators are reduced complexity climate models that are provided by WGI, and which are calibrated to the WGI assessment of future warming for  various  purposes  (a  detailed  description  of  the  use  of  climate  model  emulators  in  the  WGI  and WGIII assessments can be found in Cross-chapter Box 7.1 in the WGI report, with the connection of WGI and WGII discussed in Annex III.2.5.1).  Cumulative CO2 emissions until net zero estimated by WGIII WGIII  provides  estimates  of  cumulative  net  CO2 emissions  (from  2020  inclusive)  until  the  time  of reaching  net zero CO2 emissions (henceforth called “peak cumulative CO2  emissions”) and until the end of the century for eight temperature classes that span a range of warming levels. The numbers can be found in Table 3.2 (330-710 GtCO2 for C1; 540-930 for C2 and 640-1160 for C3). Comparing  the  WGI  remaining  carbon  budgets  and  remaining  cumulative  CO2  emissions  of  the WGIII scenarios A comparison between WGI and WGIII findings requires recognising that, unlike in WGI, cumulative emissions in WGIII are not provided for a specific peak warming threshold or level but are instead provided  for  a  set  of  scenarios  in  a  category,  representing  a  specific  range  of  peak  temperature 3-32  Total pages: 156Page 41
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII outcomes  (for  instance  the  C4  category  contains  scenarios  with  a  median  peak  warming  anywhere between  approximately  1.8°C  and  up  to  2°C).  When  accounting  for  this  difference,  the  WGI  and WGIII  findings  are  very  consistent  for  temperature  levels  below  2oC.  Figure  1  compares  the  peak temperatures and associated cumulative CO2 emissions (i.e., peak cumulative CO2 emissions) for the WGIII  scenarios  to  the  remaining  carbon  budgets  assessed  by  WGI.  This  shows  only  minor differences between the WGI and WGIII approaches. Box 3.4 Figure 1: Cumulative CO2 emissions from AR6 scenario categories (coloured dots), adjusted for distinct 0.1°C warming levels (black bars) in comparison to the WGI remaining carbon budgets (grey bars). The cumulative carbon emissions for the AR6 scenarios are shown for the median peak warming (panel a), the 33rd-percentile peak warming (panel b) and the upper 67th-percentile peak warming (panel c) calculated with the WGI-calibrated emulator MAGICC7 (IPCC AR6 WGI, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The adjustment to the nearest 0.1°C intervals is made using WGI TCRE (at the relevant percentile, e.g., the 67th-percentile TCRE is used to adjust the 67th-percentile peak warming), with the 5% to 95% range of adjusted scenarios provided by the black bar. The WGI remaining carbon budget is shown, including the WGI estimate of at least a ±220 GtCO2 uncertainty due to non-CO2 emissions variations across scenarios (grey bars). For median peak warming (panel a) projections below 2°C relative to 1850-1900, the WGIII assessment of cumulative carbon emissions tends to be slightly smaller than the remaining carbon budgets provided by WGI but well within the uncertainties. Note that only a few scenarios in WGIII limit warming to below 1.5°C with a 50% chance, thus statistics for that specific threshold have low confidence. Estimates of the remaining carbon budgets thus vary with the assumed level of non-CO2 emissions, which are a function of policies and technology development. The linear relationship used in the WGI assessment between peak temperature and the warming as a result of non-CO2  emissions (based on the SR1.5 data) is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 (dashed line). In the WG3 approach, the non-CO2 warming for each single scenario is based on the individual scenario characteristics. This shown 3-33  Total pages: 156Page 42
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII in the same figure by plotting the outcomes of scenario outcomes of a range models (dots). The lines show the fitted data for individual models, emphasizing the clear differences across models and the relationship  with  peak  warming  (policy  level).  In  some  scenarios  stringent  non-CO2 emission reductions provide an option to reach more stringent climate goals with the same carbon budget. This is  especially  the  case  for  scenarios  with  a  very  low  non-CO2  warming,  for  instance  as  a  result  of methane reductions through diet change. The left panel shows how these differences impact estimates of the remaining carbon budget. While the WGIII AR6  scenario database includes a broad range of non-CO2 emission projections the overall range is still very consistent with the WGI relationship and the estimated uncertainty with a ±220 GtCO2 range (see also panel B of Figure II.2 in Annex III.2.5). Overall, the slight differences between the cumulative emissions in WGIII and the carbon budget in WGI  are  because  the  non-CO2  warming  in  the  WGIII  AR6  scenarios  is  slightly  lower  than  in  the SR1.5  scenarios  that  are  used  for  the  budget  estimates  in  WGI  (Annex  III.2.5.1).  In  addition, improved consistency with Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in WGI results in a non-CO2 induced temperature difference  of  about  ~0.05K  between  the  assessments.  Re-calculating  the  remaining  carbon  budget using  the  WGI  methodology  combined  with  the  full  WGIII  AR6  scenario  database  results  in  a reduction of the estimated remaining 1.5C carbon budget by about 100 GtCO2 (-20%), and a reduction of ~40 GtCO2 (-3%) for 2C. Accounting also for the categorisation effect, the difference between the WGI and WGIII estimates is found to be small and well within the uncertainty range (Figure 1). This means that the cumulative CO2 emissions presented in WGIII and the WGI carbon budgets are highly consistent.  3-34  Total pages: 156Page 43
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII A detailed comparison of the impact of different assessment steps, i.e., the new emulators, scenarios, and harmonisation methods, has been made and is presented in Annex III. Policy implications The concept of a finite carbon budget means that the world needs to get to  net zero CO2, no matter whether  global  warming  is  limited  to  1.5°C  or  well  below  2°C  (or  any  other  level).  Moreover, exceeding the remaining carbon budget will have consequences by  overshooting temperature levels. Still,  the  relationship  between  the  timing  of  net  zero  and  temperature  targets  is  a  flexible  one,  as discussed further in Cross-Chapter Box 3. It should be noted that national level inventory as used by UNFCCC for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector are different from the overall concept of  anthropogenic  emissions  employed  by  IPCC  WG1.  For  emissions  estimates  based  on  these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced by approximately 15%, depending on the scenarios (Grassi et al., 2021) (see also Chapter 7).  One of the uncertainties of the remaining carbon budget is the level of non-CO2 emissions which is a function  of  policies  and  technology  development.  This  represents  a  point  of  leverage  for  policies rather  than  an  inherent  geophysical  uncertainty.  Stringent  non-CO2  emission  reductions  hence  can provide  –  to  some  degree  –  an  option  to  reach  more  stringent  climate  goals  with  the  same  carbon budget. END BOX HERE Figure 3.13: The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and temperature. The left panel shows cumulative emissions until net zero emission is reached. The right panel shows cumulative emissions until the end of the century, plotted against peak and end-of-century temperature, respectively. Both are shown as a function of non-CO2 forcing and cumulative net negative CO2 emissions. Position temperature categories (circles) and IPs are also indicated, including two 2oC sensitivity cases for Neg (Neg-2.0) and Ren (Ren-2.0). The near-linear relationship implies that cumulative CO2 emissions are critically important for climate outcomes  (Collins  et  al.  2013).  The  maximum  temperature  increase  is  a  direct  function  of  the cumulative emissions until net zero CO2 emissions is reached (the emission budget) (Figure 3.13, left side).  The  end-of-century  temperature  correlates  well  with  cumulative  emissions  across  the  century 3-35  Total pages: 156Page 44
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII (right  panel).  For long-term  climate  goals, positive emissions in  the  first  half  of  the century  can be offset by net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (net negative emissions) at the cost of a temporary overshoot of the target (Tokarska et al. 2019). The bottom panels of Figure 3.13 show the contribution of net negative CO2 emissions.  Focusing  on  cumulative  emissions,  the  right-hand  panel  of  Figure  3.12  shows  that  for  high-end scenarios  (C6-C7),  most  emissions  originate  from  fossil  fuels,  with  a  smaller  contribution  from  net deforestation. For C5 and lower, there is also a negative contribution to emissions from both AFOLU emissions and energy systems. For the energy systems, these negative emissions originate from bio-energy-and-carbon-capture-and-storage  (BECCS),  while  for  AFOLU,  they  originate  from  re-  and afforestation.  For  C3-C5,  reforestation  has  a  larger  CDR  contribution  than  BECCS,  mostly  due  to considerably  lower  costs  (Rochedo  et  al.  2018).  For  C1  and  C2,  the  tight  carbon  budgets  imply  in many scenarios more CDR use (Riahi et al. 2021). Please note that net negative emissions are not so relevant for peak temperature targets, and thus the C1 category, but CDR can still be used to offset the remaining positive emissions (Riahi et al. 2021). While positive CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are significantly reduced,  inertia and hard-to-abate sectors  imply that in many  C1-C3  scenarios,  around 800-1000 GtCO2 of net positive cumulative CO2 emissions remain. This is consistent with literature estimates that current infrastructure is associated with 650 GtCO2 (best estimate) if operated until the end of its lifetime (Tong et al. 2019).  These numbers are considerably above the estimated carbon budgets  for  1.5  °C  estimated  in  WGI,  hence  explaining  CDR  reliance  (either  to  offset  emissions immediately or later in time).  Creating  net  negative  emissions  can  thus  be  an  important  part  of  a  mitigation  strategy  to  offset remaining  emissions  or  compensate  for  emissions  earlier  in  time.  As  indicated  above,  there  are different  ways  to  potentially  achieve  this,  including  re-  and  afforestation  and  BECCS  (as  often covered in IAMs) but also soil carbon enhancement, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and ocean alkalinization (see Chapter 12). Except for reforestation, these options have not been tested at  large  scale  and  often  require  more  R&D.  Moreover,  the  reliance  on  CDR  in  scenarios  has  been discussed  given  possible  consequences  of  land  use  related  to  biodiversity  loss  and  food  security (BECCS and afforestation), the reliance on uncertain storage potentials (BECCS and DACCS), water use  (BECCS),  energy  use  (DACCS),    the  risks  of  possible  temperature  overshoot  and  the consequences  for  meeting  sustainable  development  goals  (Venton  2016;  Peters  and  Geden  2017; Smith et al. 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2017; Anderson and Peters 2016; Honegger et al. 2021). In the case of BECCS, it should be noted that bio-energy typically is associated with early-on positive CO2 emissions and net-negative effects are only achieved in time (carbon debt), and its potential is limited (Cherubini et al. 2013; Hanssen et al. 2020) (most IAMs have only a very limited representation of these  time  dynamics).  Several  scenarios  have  therefore  explored  how  reliance  on  net  negative  CO2 emissions can be reduced or even avoided by alternative emission strategies (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) or early reductions by more stringent emission reduction in the short-term (Rogelj et al. 2019b; Riahi et al. 2021). A more in-depth discussion of land-based mitigation options can be found in Chapter 7. It needs to be emphasized that even in strategies with net negative CO2 emissions, the  emission  reduction  via  more  conventional  mitigation  measures  (efficiency  improvement, decarbonisation of energy supply) is much larger than the CDR contribution (Tsutsui et al. 2020).   3.3.2.3The timing of net zero emissions In addition to the constraints on change in global mean temperature, the Paris Agreement also calls for reaching  a  balance of sources and  sinks  of  GHG  emissions (Art.  4).  Different  interpretations of  the concept  related  to  balance  have  been  published  (Rogelj  et  al.  2015c;  Fuglestvedt  et  al.  2018).  Key concepts  include  that  of  net  zero  CO2  emissions  (anthropogenic  CO2  sources  and  sinks  equal  zero) and net zero greenhouse gas emission (see also Annex I Glossary and Box 3.3). The same notion can be  used  for  all  GHG  emissions,  but  here  ranges  also  depend  on  the  use  of  equivalence  metrics (Chapter  2,  Box  2.2).  Moreover,  it  should  be  noted  that  while  reaching  net  zero  CO2  emissions typically coincides with the peak in temperature increase; net zero GHG emissions (based on GWP-100) implies a decrease in global temperature (Riahi et al. 2021) and net zero GHG emission typically 3-36  Total pages: 156Page 45
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII requires negative CO2 emissions to compensate for the remaining emissions from other GHGs. Many countries have started to formulate climate policy in the year that net zero emissions (either CO2 or all greenhouse gases) are reached – although, at the moment, formulations are often still vague (Rogelj et al.  2021).  There  has  been  increased  attention  on  the  timing  of  net  zero  emissions  in  the  scientific literature and ways to achieve it. Figure  3.14  shows  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  temperature  target,  the  cumulative  CO2 emissions  budget,  and  the  net  zero  year  for  CO2  emissions  (left)  and  the  sum  of  greenhouse  gases (right) for the scenarios published in the literature. In other words, the temperature targets from the Paris Agreement can, to some degree, be translated into a net zero emission year (Tanaka and O’Neill 2018).  There is, however, a  considerable  spread.  In  addition  to  the factors influencing the emission budget  (see  WGI  and  section  3.3.2.2), this is influenced  by the  emission trajectory  until  net  zero is reached,  decisions  related  to  temperature  overshoot  and  non-CO2  emissions  (especially  for  the moment  CO2  reaches  net  zero  emissions).  Scenarios  with  limited  or  no  net  negative  emissions  and rapid  near-term  emission  reductions  can  allow  small  positive  emissions  (e.g.,  in  hard-to-abate-sectors).  They  may  therefore  have  a  later  year  that  net  zero  CO2  emissions  are  achieved.  High emissions in the short-term, in contrast, require an early net zero year. For  the  scenarios  in  the  C1  category  (warming  below  1.5°C  (50%  probability)  with  limited overshoot),  the  net  zero  year  for  CO2  emissions  is  typically  around  2035-2070 For  scenarios  in  C3 (likely limiting warming to below 2°C), CO2 emissions reach net zero around 2060-2100. Similarly, also  the  years  for  net  zero  GHG  emissions  can  be  calculated  (see  right  graph).  The  GHG  net  zero emissions  year  is  typically  around  10-20  years  later  than  the  carbon  neutrality.  Residual  non-CO2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero CO2 range between 4-11 GtCO2-eq in pathways that likely limit warming to 2.0°C or below. In pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C, methane is reduced by around 20% (1-46%) in 2030 and almost 50% (26-64%) in 2050, and in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot by around 33% (19-57) in 2030 and a similar 50% (33-69%) in 2050.  Emissions  reduction  potentials  assumed  in  the  pathways  become  largely  exhausted  when limiting  warming  to  below  2°C.  N2O  emissions  are  reduced  too,  but  similar  to  CH4,  emission reductions saturate for stringent climate  goals. In the mitigation pathways, the emissions of cooling aerosols  are  reduced  due  to  reduced  use  of  fossil  fuels.  The  overall  impact  on  non-CO2-related warming combines these factors. In cost-optimal scenarios, regions will mostly achieve net zero emissions as a function of options for emission  reduction,  CDR,  and  expected  baseline  emission  growth  (van  Soest  et  al.  2021b).  This typically implies relatively early net zero emission years in scenarios for the Latin America region and relatively late net zero years for Asia and Africa (and average values for OECD countries). However, an allocation based on equity principles (such as responsibility, capability and equality) might result in different carbon neutrality years, based on the principles applied – with often earlier net zero years for the OECD (Fyson et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2021b). Therefore, the emission trajectory until net zero emissions is a critical determinant of future warming (see Section 3.5).  The more CO2 is emitted until 2030, the less CO2 can be emitted after that to stay below a warming limit (Riahi et al. 2015). As discussed before, also non-CO2 forcing plays a key role in the short term.

Assessment  of  net zero  GHG  emissions  additionally  requires  consideration  of  non-CO2  gases  and  choice  of  GHG emission metrics used to aggregate emissions and removals of different GHGs (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 10). The following considers net zero CO2 and GHG emissions globally, followed by regional and sectoral dimensions. Net zero CO2 Reaching net zero CO2 emissions globally is necessary for limiting global warming to any level. At the point of net zero CO2, the amount of CO2 human activity is putting into the atmosphere equals the  amount  of  CO2  human  activity  is  removing  from  the  atmosphere  (see  Glossary).  Reaching  and sustaining net zero CO2 emissions globally stabilizes CO2-induced warming. Reaching net zero CO2 emissions  and  then  moving  to  net  negative  CO2  emissions  globally  leads  to  a  peak  and  decline  in CO2-induced warming (WGI AR6 Chapter 5.5, 5.6).  Limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  or  likely  to  2°C  requires  deep,  rapid,  and  sustained  reductions  of other  greenhouse  gases  including  methane  alongside  rapid reductions  of  CO2  emissions  to  net zero. This ensures that the warming contributions from non-CO2 forcing agents as well as from CO2 emissions are both limited at low levels. WGI estimated remaining carbon budgets until the time of reaching  net  zero  CO2  emissions  for  a  range  of  warming  limits,  taking  into  account  historical  CO2 emissions  and  projections  of  the  warming  from  non-CO2  forcing  agents  (WGI  AR6  Chapter  5.5, Cross-chapter box 3). FOOTNOTE  3  A  small  fraction  of  pathways  in  the  AR6  scenarios  database  that  likely  limit  warming  to  2°C (9%) or are as likely as not to limit warming to 2°C (14%) do not reach net-zero CO2 emissions during the 21st century. This is not inconsistent with the fundamental scientific requirement to reach net-zero CO2 emissions for a  stable  climate,  but  reflects  that  in  some  pathways,  concurrent  reductions  in  non-CO2  emissions  temporarily compensate  for  on-going  warming  from  CO2  emissions.  These  would  have  to  reach  net-zero  CO2  emissions eventually  after  2100  to  maintain  these  warming  limits.  For  the  two  classes  of  pathways,  the  95th  percentile cannot be deduced from the scenario database as more than 5% of them do not reach net zero CO2 by 2100. FOOTNOTE  4 WGI Chapter 5.5 estimates a variation of the remaining carbon budget by  ± 220 GtCO2 due to variations of the non-CO2 warming contribution in 1.5-2°C pathways. This translates to a shift of the timing of 3-38  Total pages: 156Page 47
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII also affects the time of reaching net zero CO2 (Figure 1c in this Box). Global emission pathways that more than halve CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2030 can follow this rapid reduction by a more gradual decline towards net zero CO2 and still limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, reaching the point of net zero after 2050. The literature since SR1.5 included a larger fraction of such pathways than were available at the time of SR1.5. This is the primary reason for the small backward shift in the median estimate of reaching global net zero CO2 emissions in 1.5°C pathways collected in the AR6 scenario  database  compared  to  SR1.5.  This  does  not  mean  that  the  world  is  assessed  to  have  more time  to  rapidly  reduce  current  emissions  levels  compared  to  SR1.5.  The  assessment  of  emissions reductions by 2030 and 2040 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot has not changed substantially. It only means that the exact timing of reaching net zero CO2 after a steep decline of CO2 emissions until 2030 and 2040 can show some variation, and the SR1.5 median value of 2050 is still close to the middle of the current range (Figure 1c in this Box ).

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII around 5-10 years later5 than in pathways with no or limited overshoot in order to reach the net negative emissions that would then be required to return warming to 1.5°C by 2100. Those high overshoot pathways have higher transient warming and higher reliance on net-negative CO2 emissions towards the end of the 21st century. As they need to reach net zero CO2 only a few years later, with 2030 CO2 emission levels being around twice as high, they imply post-2030 CO2 emissions reduction rates that are almost double that of pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (Section 3.5). Pathways following emissions levels projected from the implementation of current NDCs until 2030 would have to reach net zero CO2 around 10 years earlier6 than cost-effective pathways to likely  limit  warming  to  2°C.  While  cost-effective  pathways  take  around  50-55  years  to  reach  net zero  CO2  emissions,  those  pathways  would  only  have  35-40  years  left  for  transitioning  to  net  zero CO2  from  2030  onwards,  close  to  the  transition  times  that  1.5°C  pathways  are  faced  with  today. Current CO2 emissions and 2030 emission levels projected under the current NDCs are in a similar range. (3.5, 4.2) Net zero GHG emissionsThe  amount  of  CO2-equivalent  emissions  and  the  point  when  net  zero  GHG  emissions  are reached  in  multi-GHG  emissions  pathways  depends  on  the  choice  of  GHG  emissions  metric. Various GHG emission metrics are available for this purpose7. GWP100 is the most commonly used metric  for  reporting  CO2-equivalent  emissions  and  is  required  for  emissions  reporting  under  the Rulebook of the Paris Agreement. (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, Annex II section 9, Annex I) FOOTNOTE  5  Pathways  following  emissions  levels  of  current  NDCs  to  2030  and  then  returning  median warming to below 1.5°C in 2100 reach net zero during 2055-2060 (2045-2070) (median five year interval and 5th-95th percentile range).  FOOTNOTE  6 Pathways that follow emission levels projected from the implementation of current NDCs until 2030 and that still likely limit warming to 2°C reach net zero CO2 emissions during 2065  - 2070 (2060 - ...) compared with 2075 - 2080 (2060 - …) in cost-effective pathways acting immediately to likely limit warming to 2°C  (median  five  year  interval  and  5th-95th  percentile  range).  See  Footnote  1  for  the  lack  of  95th  percentile. (Chapter 3.3 Table 3.1.) FOOTNOTE 7 Defining net zero GHG emissions for a basket of greenhouse gases (GHGs) relies on a metric to convert  GHG  emissions  including  methane  (CH4),  nitrous  oxide  (N2O),  fluorinated  gases  (F-gases),  and potentially  other  gases,  to  CO2-equivalent  emissions.  The  choice  of  metric  ranges  from  Global  Warming Potentials  (GWPs)  and  Global  Temperature  change  Potentials  (GTP)  to  economically-oriented  metrics.  All metrics  have  advantages  and  disadvantages  depending  on  the  context  in  which  they  are  used  (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2). 3-40  Total pages: 156Page 49
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII emissions  pathways  in the  AR6  scenario  database that  reach  global  net  zero  GHG  emissions  in the second  half  of  the  century  show  warming  being  halted  at  some  peak  value  followed  by  a  gradual decline towards the end of the century (WGI Chapter 1 Box 1.4).  Global net zero GHG emissions measured in terms of GWP100 are reached between 2095-2100 (2055  -  ...)8in  emission  pathways  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot (median  and  5th-95th  percentile).  Around  50%  of  pathways  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C  with  no  or limited overshoot and 70% of pathways limiting likely warming to 2°C do not reach net zero GHG emissions in terms of GWP100 before 2100. These pathways tend to show less reduction in warming after  the  peak  than  pathways  that  reach  net  zero  GHG  emissions.  For  the  subset  of  pathways  that reach net zero GHG emissions before 2100, including 90% of pathways that return warming to 1.5°C by  2100  after  a  high (>0.1°C)  overshoot, the  time lag  between  reaching  net zero  CO2  and  net  zero GHG is 11-14 (6-40) years and the amount of net negative CO2 emissions deployed to balance non-CO2 emissions at the time of net zero is -6 to -7 (-10 to -4) GtCO2 (range of medians and lowest 5th to highest 95 percentile across the four scenario classes that limit median warming to 2°C or lower). (section 3.3, Table 3.1) Sectoral and regional aspects of net zero The timing of net zero CO2 or GHG emissions may differ across regions and sectors. Achieving net  zero  emissions globally  implies  that  some  sectors  and regions must  reach  net zero  CO2  or GHG ahead of the time of global net zero CO2 or GHG if others reach it later. Similarly, some sectors  and  regions  would  need  to  achieve  net  negative  CO2  or  GHG  emissions  to  compensate  for continued  emissions  by  other  sectors  and  regions  after  the  global  net  zero  year.  Differences  in  the timing to reach net zero emissions between sectors and regions depend on multiple factors, including the  potential  of  countries  and  sectors  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  undertake  carbon  dioxide removal,  the  associated  costs,  and  the  availability  of  policy  mechanisms  to  balance  emissions  and removals  between  sectors  and  countries  (Fyson  et  al.  2020;  Strefler  et  al.  2021a;  van  Soest  et  al. 2021b).  A  lack  of  such  mechanisms  could  lead  to  higher  global  costs  to  reach  net  zero  emissions globally, but less interdependencies and institutional needs (Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2020). Sectors will reach net zero CO2 and GHG emissions at different times if they are aiming for such targets with sector-specific  policies  or  as  part  of  an  economy-wide  net  zero  emissions  strategy  integrating emissions  reductions and removals  across  sectors.  In the latter case,  sectors  with  large  potential for achieving  net-negative  emissions  would  go  beyond  net  zero  to  balance  residual  emissions  from sectors with low potential which in turn would take more time compared to the case of sector-specific action. Global pathways project global AFOLU emissions to reach global net zero CO2 the earliest, around  2030-2035  in  pathways  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2°C  and  below,  by  rapid  reduction  of deforestation  and  enhancing  carbon  sinks  on  land,  although  net  zero  GHG  emissions  from  global AFOLU are typically reached 30 years later, if at all. The ability of global AFOLU CO2 emissions to reach net zero as early as in the 2030s in modelled pathways hinges on optimistic assumptions about the ability to establish global cost-effective mechanisms to balance emissions reductions and removals across regions and sectors. These assumptions have been challenged in the literature and the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (IPCC SRCCL).The adoption and implementation of net zero CO2 or GHG emission targets by countries and regions also depends on equity and capacity criteria. The Paris Agreement recognizes that peaking of emissions will occur later in developing countries (Article 4.1). Just transitions to net zero CO2 or GHG could be expected to follow multiple pathways, in different contexts. Regions may decide about net  zero  pathways  based  on  their  consideration  of  potential  for  rapid  transition  to  low-carbon development  pathways,  the  capacity  to  design  and  implement  those  changes,  and  perceptions  of equity within and across countries. Cost-effective pathways from global models have been shown to FOOTNOTE 8 The 95th percentile cannot be deduced from the scenario database as more than 5% of pathways do not reach net zero GHG by 2100 (Chapter 3.3 Table 3.1.), hence denoted by -… 3-41  Total pages: 156Page 50

Formulation  of  net  zero  pathways  by  countries  will  benefit  from  clarity  on  scope,  roadmaps  and fairness  (Rogelj  et  al.  2021;  Smith  2021).  Achieving  net  zero  emission  targets  relies  on  policies, institutions and milestones against which to track progress. Milestones can include emissions levels, as well as markers of technological diffusion.  The accounting of anthropogenic carbon dioxide removal on land matters for the evaluation of net zero CO2 and net zero GHG strategies. Due to the use of different approaches between national inventories and global models, the current net CO2 emissions are lower by 5.5 GtCO2, and cumulative net  CO2  emissions  in  modelled  1.5-2°C  pathways  would  be  lower  by  104-170  GtCO2,  if  carbon dioxide  removals  on  land  are  accounted  based  on  national  GHG  inventories.  National  GHG inventories typically consider a much larger area of managed forest than global models, and on this area  additionally  consider  the  fluxes  due  to  human-induced  global  environmental  change  (indirect effects) to be anthropogenic, while global models consider these fluxes to be natural. Both approaches capture the same land fluxes, only the accounting of anthropogenic vs. natural emission is different. Methods  to  convert  estimates  from  global  models  to  the  accounting  scheme  of  national  GHG inventories  will  improve  the  use  of  emission  pathways  from  global  models  as  benchmarks  against which collective progress is assessed.

Mitigation pathways likely to limit global warming to 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels are associated with net global GHG emissions of 40 (32–55) GtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2030 and 20 (13-26) GtCO2-eq yr-1 in 2050. These correspond to GHG emissions reductions of 21 (1-42) % by 2030, and 64 (53-77) % by 2050 relative to 2019 emission levels. Pathways that limit global warming to below 1.5°C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  require  a  further  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  the  transformation, with  GHG  emissions  reductions  of  43  (34–60)  %  by  2030  and  84  (74–98)  %  in  2050  relative  to modelled 2019 emission levels. The likelihood of limiting warming to below 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot of the most stringent mitigation pathways in the literature (C1) has declined since SR1.5. This is because emissions have risen since 2010 by about 9 GtCO2 yr-1, resulting in relatively higher near-term emissions of the AR6 pathways by 2030 and slightly later dates for reaching net zero CO2 emissions compared to SR1.5  Given the larger contribution of scenarios in the literature that aim to reduce net-negative emissions, emission reductions are somewhat larger in the short-term compared to similar categories in the IPCC SR1.5.  At  the  same time, the  year  of  net zero  emissions  is somewhat  later  (but  only  if these  rapid, short-term emission reductions are achieved). The scenarios in the literature in C1-C3 show a peak in global emissions before 2025. Not achieving this requires a more rapid reduction after 2025 to still meet the Paris goals (see Section 3.5).  3-43  Total pages: 156Page 52

If the fraction of pathways that reach net zero before 2100 (one minus fraction in square brackets) is lower than the fraction of pathways covered by a percentile (e.g., 0.95 for the 95th percentile), the percentile is not defined and denoted with "…".For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and calculated as Kyoto basket with AR6 GWP-100 CO2-equivalent factors. For each scenario, a minimum of native reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions to 2100 was required for the assessment of the climate response and assignment to a climate category. Emissions scenarios without climate assessment are not included in the ranges. See Annex III. For better comparability with the WGI assessment of the remaining carbon budget, the cumulative CO2 emissions of the pathways are harmonized to the 2015 CO2 emissions levels used in the WGI assessment and are calculated for the future starting on 1 January 2020.Temperature change (Global Surface Air Temperature - GSAT) for category (at peak and in 2100), based on the median warming for each scenario assessed using the probabilistic climate model emulators.Probability  of  staying  below  the  temperature  thresholds  for  the  scenarios  in  each  category,  taking  into  consideration  the  range  of  uncertainty  from  the  climate  model  emulators  consistent  with  the  WGI  AR6 assessment.

The categories C1-C7 are explained in Table 3.1 The  spread  shown  in  Figure  3.15  implies  different  mitigation  strategies  that  could  all  lead  to emissions levels consistent with the Paris Agreement (and reach zero emissions). The IMPs illustrate some options for different decarbonization pathways with heavy reliance on renewables (Ren), strong emphasis on energy demand reductions (LD), wide-spread deployment of CDR methods coupled with CCS (BECCS and DACCS) (Neg), mitigation in the context of sustainable development (SP) (Figure 3.16). For example, in some scenarios, a small part of the energy system is still based on fossil fuels in 2100 (Neg), while in others, fossil fuels are almost or completely phased out (Ren). Nevertheless, in all  scenarios,  fossil  fuel  use  is  greatly  reduced  and  unabated  coal  use  is  completely  phased  out  by 2050. Also, nuclear power can be part of a mitigation strategy (however, the literature only includes some scenarios with high-nuclear contributions, such as Berger et al. (2017)). This is explored further in Section 3.5. The different strategies are also clearly apparent in the way they scenarios reach  net zero emissions. While  GS and Neg rely significantly on  BECCS and DACCS, their use is far more restricted in the other IMPs. Consistently, in these IMPs also residual emissions are also significantly lower. Figure 3.16: Primary energy use and net emissions at net zero year for the different IMPS Mitigation  pathways  also  have  a  regional  dimension.  In  2010,  about  40%  of  emissions  originated from  the  Developed  Countries  and  Eastern  Europe  and  west-central  Asia  regions.  According  to  the in projections shown Figure 3.17, the share of the latter regions will further increase to about 70% by 2050. In the scenarios in the literature, emissions are typically almost equally reduced across the regions. Figure 3.179: Emissions by region (including 5-95th percentile range) 3.3.3Climate impacts on mitigation potential At  the  moment,  climate  change  impact  on  mitigation  potential  is  hardly  considered  in  model-based scenarios. While a detailed overview of climate impacts is provided in IPCC  WGII and Section 3.6 discusses  the  economic  consequences,  here  we  concentrate  on  the  implications  for  mitigation potential.  Climate  change  directly  impacts  the  carbon  budget  via  all  kinds  of  feedbacks  –  which  is included in the ranges provided for the carbon budget (e.g., 300-900 GtCO2 for 17th-83rd percentile for not exceeding 1.5 °C; see Chapter 5 IPCC, 2021). Climate change, however, alters the production and consumption of energy (see also Chapter 6.5). An overview of the literature is provided by Yalew et al.  (2020).  In  terms  of  supply,  impacts  could  influence  the  cooling  capacity  of  thermal  plants,  the potential and predictability of renewable energy, and energy infrastructure (Cronin et al. 2018a; van Vliet  et  al.  2016;  Turner  et  al.  2017;  Lucena  et  al.  2018;  Gernaat  et  al.  2021;  Yalew  et  al.  2020). Although the outcomes of these studies differ, they seem to suggest that although impacts might be relatively  small  at  the  global  scale,  they  could  be  substantial  at  the  regional  scale  (increasing  or decreasing  potential).  Climate  change  can  also  impact  energy  demand,  with  rising  temperatures resulting  in  decreases  in  heating  demand  and  increases  in  cooling  demand  (Isaac  and  van  Vuuren 2009; Zhou et al. 2014; Labriet et al. 2015; McFarland et al. 2015; Auffhammer et al. 2017; Clarke et al. 2018; van Ruijven et al. 2019; Yalew et al. 2020). As expected, the increase in cooling demand dominates the impact in warm regions and decreases in heating demand in cold regions (Clarke et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2014; Isaac and van Vuuren 2009). Globally, most studies show a net increase in energy demand at the end of the century due to climate impacts  (van Ruijven et al. 2019; Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Clarke et al. 2018); however, one study shows a net decrease (Labriet et al. 2015). Only  a  few  studies  quantify  the  combined  impacts  of  climate  change  on  energy  supply  and  energy demand  (Emodi  et  al.  2019;  Steinberg et al.  2020; McFarland  et  al.  2015;  Mima  and  Criqui 2015). These studies show increases in electricity generation in the USA (McFarland et al. 2015; Steinberg et al. 2020) and increases in CO2 emissions in Australia (Emodi et al. 2019) or the USA (McFarland et al. 2015). Climate change can impact the potential for AFOLU mitigation action by altering terrestrial carbon uptake, crop yields and bioenergy potential (see also Chapter 7). Carbon sequestration in forests may be positively or adversely affected by climate change and CO2 fertilization. On the one hand, elevated CO2 levels and higher temperatures could enhance tree growth rates, carbon sequestration, and timber and biomass production (Beach et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2020). On the other hand, FOOTNOTE9  The  countries  and  areas  classification  in  this  figure  deviate  from  the  standard  classification scheme adopted by WGIII as set out in Annex II, section 1. climate change could lead to greater frequency and intensity of disturbance events in forests, such as fires,  prolonged  droughts,  storms,  pests  and  diseases  (Kim  et  al.  2017;  Anderegg  et  al.  2020).  The impact  of  climate  change  on  crop  yields  could  also  indirectly  impact  the  availability  of  land  for mitigation and AFOLU emissions (Meijl et al. 2018; Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014; Bajželj and Richards 2014; Beach et al. 2015). The impact is, however, uncertain, as discussed in WGII Chapter 5. A few studies estimate the effect of climate impacts on AFOLU on mitigation, finding increases in carbon prices or mitigation costs by 1-6% in most scenarios (Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014).  In summary, a limited number of studies quantify the impact of climate on emissions pathways. The most important impact in energy systems might be through the impact on demand, although climate change  could  also  impact  renewable  mitigation  potential  -certainly  at  the  local  and  regional  scale. Climate  change  might  be  more  important  for  land-use  related  mitigation  measures,  including afforestation,  bioenergy  and  nature-based  solutions.  The  net  effect  of  changes  in  climate  and  CO2 fertilization are uncertain but could be substantial (see also Chapter 7).  3.4Integrating sectoral analysis into systems transformations This section describes the role of sectors in long-term emissions pathways (see Table 3.3). We discuss both  sectoral  aspects  of  IAM  pathways  and  some  insights  from  sectoral  studies.  Sectoral  studies typically include more detail and additional mitigation options compared to IAMs. However, sectoral studies miss potential feedbacks and cross-sectoral linkages that are captured by IAMs. Additionally, since  IAMs  include  all  emissions  sources,  these  models  can  be  used  to  identify  pathways  to  a particular climate goals. In such pathways, emissions are balanced across sectors typically based on relative marginal abatement costs; as a result, some sectors are sources and some are sinks at the time of net zero CO2 emissions. For these reasons, the mitigation observed in each sector in an IAM may differ from the potential in sectoral studies. Given the strengths and limitations of each type of model, IAMs and sectoral models are complementary, providing different perspectives.

Some models report this category in the buildings sector, while others report it in the “Other” sector 3.4.1Cross-sector linkages 3.4.1.1Demand and supply strategies Most  IAM  pathways  rely  heavily  on  supply-side  mitigation  strategies,  including  fuel  switching, decarbonization  of  fuels,  and  CDR  (Creutzig  et  al.  2016;  Bertram  et  al.  2018;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018b; Mundaca  et  al.  2019).  For  demand-side  mitigation,  IAMs  incorporate changes in  energy  efficiency, but many other demand-side options (e.g., behaviour and lifestyle changes) are often excluded from models (van Sluisveld et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 2019; van den Berg et al. 2019). In  addition,  this  mitigation  is  typically  price-driven  and  limited  in  magnitude  (Yeh  et  al.  2017; Sharmina  et  al.  2020;  Luderer  et  al.  2018;  Wachsmuth  and  Duscha  2019).  In  contrast,  bottom-up modelling  studies  show  considerable  potential  for  demand-side  mitigation  (Yeh  et  al.  2017; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Creutzig et al. 2016; Mundaca et al. 2019) (see also Chapter 5), which can slow emissions growth and/or reduce emissions (Samadi et al. 2017; Creutzig et al. 2016). A small number of mitigation pathways include stringent demand-side mitigation, including changes in thermostat set points (van Vuuren et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2016), more efficient or smarter appliances (Grubler et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019; van Sluisveld et al. 2016), increased recycling or reduced industrial goods (van de Ven et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al.  2018;  Napp  et  al.  2019),  telework  and  travel  avoidance  (van  de  Ven  et  al.  2018;  Grubler  et  al. 2018), shifts to public transit (van Vuuren et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018), reductions  in  food  waste  (van  de  Ven  et  al.  2018)  and  less  meat  intensive  diets  (van  de  Ven  et  al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018). These pathways show reduced dependence on CDR and reduced pressure on land  (van de Ven et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; Rogelj  et  al.  2018a)  (Chapter  5.3.3).  However,  the  representation  of  these  demand-side  mitigation options in IAMs is limited, with most models excluding the costs of such changes (van Sluisveld et al. 2016),  using  stylised  assumptions  to  represent  them  (van  den  Berg  et  al.  2019),  and  excluding rebound effects (Brockway et al. 2021; Krey et al. 2019). Furthermore, there are questions about the achievability  of  such  pathways,  including  whether  the  behavioural  changes  included  are  feasible (Azevedo et al. 2021) and the extent to which development and demand can be decoupled (Semieniuk et al. 2021; Steckel et al. 2013; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021; Brockway et al. 2021). Figure 3.18: Indicators of demand and supply-side mitigation in the Illustrative Pathways (lines) and the 5-95% range of Reference, 1.5C and 2C scenarios (shaded areas). shows indicators of supply- and demand-side mitigation in the IMPs, as well as the range across the database. Two of these IMPs (SP,  LD)  show  strong  reductions  in  energy  demand,  resulting  in  less  reliance  on  bioenergy  and limited  CDR  from  energy  supply.  In  contrast,  Neg  has  higher  energy  demand,  depending  more  on bioenergy and net negative CO2 emissions from energy supply.  Figure 3.18: Indicators of demand and supply-side mitigation in the Illustrative Pathways (lines) and the 5-95% range of Reference, 1.5C and 2C scenarios (shaded areas). 3.4.1.2Sectoral emissions strategies and the timing of net zero Mitigation pathways show differences in the timing of decarbonization (Figure 3.20) and the timing of net  zero  (Figure  3.19)  across  sectors  and  regions  (high  confidence);  the  timing  in  a  given  sector depends on the cost of abatement in it, the availability of CDR options, the scenario design, near-term emissions  levels,  and  the  amount  of  non-CO2  abatement  (Yeh  et  al.  2017;  Emmerling  et  al.  2019; Rogelj et al. 2019a,b; Johansson et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2021b; Ou et al. 2021; Azevedo et al. 2021)  (Cross-Chapter  Box  3  in  this  chapter).  However,  delaying  emissions  reductions,  or  more limited  emissions  reductions  in  one  sector  or  region,  involves  compensating  reductions  in  other sectors or regions if warming is to be limited (high confidence) (Rochedo et al. 2018; Price and Keppo 2017; Grubler et al. 2018; van Soest et al. 2021b).

The colours indicate the decade in which CO2 emissions go negative; the y-axis indicates the share of scenarios achieving net zero in that decade. Only scenarios that pass the vetting criteria are included (see Section 3.2). Scenarios achieving net zero prior to 2020 are excluded. At  the  time  of  net  zero  global  CO2  emissions,  emissions  in  some  sectors  are  positive  and  some negative.  In  cost-effective  mitigation  pathways,  the  energy  supply  sector  typically  reaches  net  zero CO2  before  the  economy  as  a  whole,  while  the  demand  sectors  reach  net  zero  CO2  later,  if  at  all (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Price and Keppo 2017; Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Méjean et al. 2019; Azevedo et al. 2021) (Chapter 6.7). CO2 emissions from transport, industry, and buildings are positive, and non-CO2 GHG emissions are also positive at the time of global net zero CO2 emissions (Figure 3.20).

Definitions of significant and very significant are defined relative to 2019 and vary between indicators, as follows: fossil energy (significant >10%, very significant >50%), renewables (>150 EJ yr-1, >200 EJ yr-1), bioenergy (>100%, >200%), BECCS (>2.0 GtCO2 yr-1, >3.5 GtCO2 yr-1), AFOLU (>100% decline, >130%), energy crops (>150 million ha, >400), forest (>5% increase, >15%). In the context of mitigation pathways, only a few studies have examined solar radiation modification (SRM),  typically  focusing  on  Stratospheric  Aerosol  Injection  (Emmerling  and  Tavoni  2018a,b; Arinoa et al. 2016; Belaia et al. 2021; Rickels et al. 2020; Heutel et al. 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019). These  studies  find  that  substantial  mitigation  is  required  to  limit  warming  to  a  given  level,  even  if FOOTNOTE  10  Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  values  in  parentheses  in  Section  3.4  from  this  point  forward indicate the 5-95% range. 3-55  Total pages: 156Page 64
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII SRM  is  available  (Moreno-Cruz  and  Smulders  2017;  Emmerling  and  Tavoni  2018b;  Belaia  et  al. 2021). SRM may reduce some climate impacts, reduce peak temperatures, lower mitigation costs, and extend the time available to achieve mitigation; however, SRM does not address ocean acidification and  may  involve  risks  to  crop  yields,  economies,  human  health,  or  ecosystems  (WGII  Chapter  16; WGI  TS;  WGI  Ch  5;  SR1.5  SPM;  Cross-Working  Group  Box  4  in  Chapter  14).  There  also  are significant uncertainties surrounding SRM, including uncertainties on the costs and risks, which can substantially alter the amount of SRM used in modelled pathways (Tavoni et al. 2017; NASEM 2021; Heutel  et  al.  2018;  Helwegen  et  al.  2019;  IPCC  2018).  Furthermore,  the  degree  of  international cooperation  can  influence  the  amount  of  SRM  deployed  in  scenarios,  with  uncoordinated  action resulting  in  larger  SRM  deployment  and  consequently  larger  risks/impacts  from  SRM  (Emmerling and  Tavoni  2018a).  Bridging  research  and  governance  involves  consideration  of  the  full  range  of societal choices and ramifications (Sugiyama et al. 2018). More information on SRM, including the caveats,  risks,  uncertainties,  and  governance  issues  is  found  in  WGI  Chapter  4,  WGIII  Chapter  14, and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14).  3.4.1.3Linkages among sectors Mitigation in one sector can be dependent upon mitigation in another sector, or may involve trade-offs between  sectors.  Mitigation  in  energy  demand  often  includes  electrification  (Luderer  et  al.  2018; Pietzcker et al. 2014; Sharmina et al. 2020; DeAngelo et al. 2021), however such pathways only result in  reduced  emissions  if  the  electricity  sector  is  decarbonized  (Zhang  and  Fujimori  2020)  (see  also Chapter 12). Relatedly, the mitigation potential of some sectors (e.g., transportation) depends on the decarbonization  of  liquid  fuels,  e.g.,  through  biofuels  (Wise  et  al.  2017;  Pietzcker  et  al.  2014; Sharmina  et  al.  2020);  Chapter  12).  In  other  cases,  mitigation  in  one  sector  results  in  reduced emissions in another sector. For example, increased recycling can reduce primary resource extraction; planting  trees  or  green  roofs  in  urban  areas  can  reduce  the  energy  demand  associated  with  space cooling (Chapter 12). Mitigation  in  one  sector  can  also  result  in  additional  emissions  in  another.  One  example  is electrification of end use which can result in increased emissions from energy supply. However, one comparitively  well-researched  example  of  this  linkage  is  bioenergy.  An  increase  in  demand  for bioenergy  within  the  energy  system  has  the  potential  to  influence  emissions  in  the  AFOLU  sector through  the  intensification  of  land  and  forest  management  and/or  via  land  use  change  (Smith  et  al. 2019; Daioglou et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2020a; IPCC 2019a). The effect of bioenergy and BECCS on mitigation depends on a variety of factors in modelled pathways. In the energy system, the emissions mitigation  depends  on  the  scale  of  deployment,  the  conversion  technology,  and  the  fuel  displaced (Calvin  et  al.  2021).  Limiting  or  excluding  bioenergy  and/or  BECCS  increases  mitigation  cost  and may  limit  the  ability  of  a  model  to  reach  a  low  warming  level  (Edmonds  et  al.  2013;  Calvin  et  al. 2014b;  Muratori  et  al.  2020;  Luderer  et  al.  2018).  In  AFOLU,  bioenergy  can  increase  or  decrease terrestrial  carbon  stocks  and  carbon  sequestration,  depending  on  the  scale,  biomass  feedstock,  land management practices, and prior land use  (Calvin et al. 2014c; Wise et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2019, 2020a; IPCC 2019a; Calvin et al. 2021). Pathways with very high biomass production for energy use typically include very high carbon prices in  the  energy  system  (Popp  et  al.  2017;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018b),  little  or  no  land  policy  (Calvin  et  al. 2014b),  a  high  discount  rate  (Emmerling  et  al.  2019),  and  limited  non-BECCS  CDR  options  (e.g., afforestation,  DACCS)  (Fuhrman  et  al.  2020;  Realmonte  et  al.  2019;  Chen  and  Tavoni  2013; Marcucci  et  al.  2017;  Calvin  et  al.  2014b).  Higher  levels  of  bioenergy  consumption  are  likely  to involve trade-offs with mitigation in other sectors, notably in construction (i.e., wood for material and structural products) and AFOLU (carbon stocks and future carbon sequestration), as well as trade-offs with sustainability (Section 3.7) and feasibility concerns (Section 3.8). Not all of these trade-offs are 3-56  Total pages: 156Page 65
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII 3.4.2Energy supply Without  mitigation,  energy  consumption  and  supply  emissions  continue  to  rise  (high  confidence) (Riahi et al. 2017; Bauer et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2016; Mcjeon et al. 2021) (see also Chapter 6.7). While the share of renewable energy continues to grow in reference scenarios, fossil fuel accounts for the largest share of primary energy (Riahi et al. 2017; Bauer et al. 2017; Price and Keppo 2017). In scenarios likely to limit warming to 2℃ and below, transition of the energy supply sector to a low or no carbon system is rapid (Rogelj et al. 2016, 2018b; Luderer et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). CO2 emissions from energy supply reach net zero around 2041 (2033 to 2057) in pathways limiting  warming  to  below 1.5℃  with  no or  limited  overshoot  and  around  2053  (2040 to 2066)  in  pathways  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2℃.  Emissions  reductions  continue,  with  emissions reaching  -7.1  GtCO2  per  year  (-15  to  -2.3  GtCO2  per  year)  in  2100  in  all  pathways  likely  to  limit warming to 2℃ and below.  All  pathways  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2C  and  below  show  substantial  reductions  in  fossil  fuel consumption and a near elimination of the use of coal without CCS (high confidence) (Welsby et al. 2021; Bauer et al. 2017; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; Azevedo et al. 2021; Mcjeon et al. 2021) (Figure 3.22). In these pathways, the use of coal, gas and oil is reduced by 90, 25, and 41%, respectively, between 2019 and 2050 and 91, 39, and 78% between 2019 and 2100; coal without CCS is further reduced to 99% below its 2019 levels in 2100. These pathways show an increase in low carbon energy, with 88% (69-97%) of primary energy from low  carbon  sources  in  2100,  with  different  combinations  of  low  carbon  fuels  (e.g.,  non-biomass renewables, biomass, nuclear, and CCS) (Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (Chapter 6.7, Section  3.4.1).  Across  all  pathways  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2℃  and  below,  non-biomass renewables account for 52% (24 to 77%) of primary energy in 2100 (Pietzcker et al. 2017; Creutzig et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018b); Figure 3.22, Chapter 6). There are some studies analysing the potential for 100% renewable energy systems (Hansen et al. 2019); however, there are a range of issues around such systems (see Chapter 6.6, Box 6.6).  3-57  Total pages: 156Page 66

Scenarios are grouped by their temperature category. Primary energy is reported in direct equivalent, where one unit of nuclear or non-biomass renewable energy output is reported as one unit of primary energy. Not all subcategories of primary energy are shown. Stringent  emissions  reductions  at  the  level  required  to  limit  warming  to  2C  or  1.5C  are  achieved through  increased  electrification  of  end-use,  resulting  in  increased  electricity  generation  in  all pathways  (high  confidence)  (Figure  3.23)  (Rogelj  et  al.  2018a;  Azevedo  et  al.  2021).  Nearly  all electricity  in  pathways  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2℃  and  below  is  from  low  or  no  carbon  fuels (Rogelj  et  al.  2018a;  Azevedo  et  al.  2021),  with  different  shares  of  nuclear,  biomass,  non-biomass renewables,  and  fossil  CCS  across  pathways.

Low carbon includes non-biomass renewables, biomass, nuclear, and CCS. 3.4.3Buildings Global  final  energy  use  in  the  building  sector  increases  in  all  pathways  as  a  result  of  population growth and increasing affluence (Figure 3.24). There is very little difference in final energy intensity for the buildings sector across scenarios. Direct CO2 emissions from the buildings sector vary more widely across temperature stabilization levels than energy consumption. In 2100, scenarios above 3ºC [C7-C8] still show an increase of CO2 emissions from buildings around 29% above 2019, while all scenarios  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2ºC  and  below  have  emission  reductions  of  around  85%  (8-100%).  Carbon  intensity  declines  in  all  scenarios,  but  much  more  sharply  as  the  warming  level  is reduced. 3-59  Total pages: 156Page 68

Energy intensity is final energy per unit of GDP. Carbon intensity is CO2 emissions per EJ of final energy. The first four indicators are indexed to 201911, where values less than 1 indicate a reduction.  In  all  scenarios,  the  share  of  electricity  in  final  energy  use  increases,  a  trend  that  is  accelerated  by 2050  for  the  scenarios  likely  to  limit  warming  to  2ºC  and  below  (Figure  3.23).  By  2100,  the  low warming  scenarios  show  large  shares  of  electricity  in  final  energy  consumption  for  buildings.  The opposite is observed for gases.  While several global IAM models have developed their buildings modules considerably over the past decade  (Daioglou  et  al.  2012;  Knobloch  et  al.  2017;  Clarke  et  al.  2018;  Edelenbosch  et  al.  2021; Mastrucci  et  al.  2021),  the  extremely  limited  availability  of  key  sectoral  variables  in  the  AR6 scenarios  database  (such  as  floor  space  and  energy  use  for  individual  services)  prohibit  a  detailed analysis of sectoral dynamics. Individual studies in the literature often focus on single aspects of the buildings  sector, though  collectively  providing  a  more  comprehensive  overview  (Edelenbosch  et  al. 2020;  Ürge-Vorsatz  et  al.  2020).  For  example,  energy  demand  is  driven  by  economic  development that  fulfills  basic  needs  (Mastrucci  et  al.  2019;  Rao  et  al.  2019a),  but  also  drives  up  floorspace  in general (Daioglou et al. 2012; Levesque et al. 2018; Mastrucci et al. 2021) and ownership of energy intensive  appliances  such  as  air  conditioners  (Isaac  and  van  Vuuren  2009;  Colelli  and  Cian  2020; Poblete-Cazenave et al. 2021). These dynamics are heterogeneous and lead to differences in energy demand and emission mitigation potential across urban/rural buildings and income levels (Krey et al. 2012;  Poblete-Cazenave  et  al.  2021).  Mitigation  scenarios  rely  on  fuel  switching  and  technology (Dagnachew  et  al.  2020;  Knobloch  et  al.  2017),  efficiency  improvement  in  building  envelopes (Edelenbosch et al. 2021; Levesque et al. 2018) and behavioural changes (Niamir et al. 2018, 2020; FOOTNOTE  11  2019  values  are  from  model  results  and  interpolated  from  other  years  when  not  directly reported. 3-60  Total pages: 156Page 69
 Figure 3.25: Transport final energy (top left), CO2 emissions (top middle), carbon intensity (top right), and share of final energy from electricity (bottom left), hydrogen (bottom middle), and biofuels (bottom right). See Chapter 10 for a discussion of energy intensity. Carbon intensity is CO2 emissions per EJ of final energy. The first three indicators are indexed to 201912, where values less than 1 indicate a reduction.  Reference scenarios show growth in transport demand, particularly in aviation and freight (Yeh et al. 2017;  Sharmina  et  al.  2020;  Müller-Casseres  et  al.  2021b).  Energy  consumption  continues  to  be dominated by fossil fuels in reference scenarios, with some increases in electrification (Edelenbosch et  al.  2020;  Yeh  et  al.  2017).  CO2  emissions  from  transport  increase  for  most  models  in  reference scenarios (Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch et al. 2020).  The relative contribution of demand-side reduction, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and decarbonisation of fuels, varyies by model, level of mitigation, mitigation options available, and underlying socio-economic pathway (Longden 2014; Wise et al. 2017; Luderer et al. 2018; Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch et al. 2020; Müller-Casseres et al. 2021a,b). IAMs typically rely on technology-focused measures like energy efficiency improvements and fuel switching to reduce carbon emissions (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Edelenbosch et al. 2017a; Yeh et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018a,b; Rogelj et al. 2018b; Sharmina et al. 2020). Many mitigation pathways show electrification of the transport system (Luderer  et  al.  2018;  Pietzcker  et  al.  2014;  Longden  2014;  Zhang  et  al.  2018a);  however,  without decarbonization  of  the  electricity  system,  transport  electrification  can  increase  total  energy  system emissions (Zhang and Fujimori 2020). A small number of pathways include demand-side mitigation measures in the transport sector; these studies show reduced carbon prices and reduced dependence on FOOTNOTE  12  2019  values  are  from  model  results  and  interpolated  from  other  years  when  not  directly reported. 3-61  Total pages: 156Page 70
 As a result of these missing options and differences in how mitigation is implemented, IAMs tend to show  less  mitigation  than  the  potential  from  national  transport/energy  models  (Wachsmuth  and Duscha 2019; Gota et al. 2019; Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch et al. 2020). For the transport sector as a whole, studies suggest a mitigation potential of 4-5 GtCO2 per year in 2030 (Edelenbosch et al. 2020) with  complete  decarbonization  possible  by  2050  (Gota  et  al.  2019;  Wachsmuth  and  Duscha  2019). However,  in  the    scenarios  assessed  in  this  chapter  that  limit  warming  to  below  1.5C  with  no  or limited  overshoot,  transport  sector  CO2  emissions  are  reduced  by  only  59%  (28%  to  81%)  in  2050 compared to 2015. IAM pathways also show less electrification than the potential from other studies; pathways that limit warming to below 1.5C with no or limited overshoot show a median of 25% (7 to 43%)  of  final  energy  from  electricity  in  2050,  while  the  IEA  NZE  scenario  includes  45%  (IEA 2021a).

 Figure 3.26: Industrial final energy, including feedstocks (top left), CO2 emissions (top middle), carbon intensity (top right), energy intensity (bottom left), share of final energy from electricity (bottom middle), and share of final energy from gases (bottom right). Energy intensity is final energy per unit of GDP. Carbon intensity is CO2 emissions per EJ of final energy. The first four indicators are indexed to 2019,14 where values less than 1 indicate a reduction. Industrial sector CO2 emissions include fuel combustion emissions only. Reference  scenarios  show  declines  in  energy  intensity,  but  increases  in  final  energy  use  in  the industrial sector  (Edelenbosch et al. 2017b). These scenarios show increases in CO2 emissions both for the total industrial sector (Edelenbosch et al. 2020; Luderer et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2017b) and individual subsectors like cement and iron and steel (van Ruijven et al. 2016; van Sluisveld et al. 2021) or chemicals (Daioglou et al. 2014; van Sluisveld et al. 2021).  In  mitigation  pathways,  CO2  emissions  reductions  are  achieved  through  a  combination  of  energy savings  (via  energy  efficiency  improvements  and  energy  conservation),  structural  change,  fuel switching, and decarbonization of fuels (Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2017b,  2020).  Mitigation  pathways  show  reductions  in  final  energy  for  industry  compared  to  the baseline  (Edelenbosch et al. 2017b; Luderer et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2020) and reductions in the carbon intensity of the industrial sector through both fuel switching and the use of CCS (Paltsev et al. 2021; Luderer et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2017b, 2020; van Ruijven et al. 2016; van Sluisveld et al. 2021). The mitigation potential differs depending on the industrial subsector and the availability of  CCS,  with  larger  potential  reductions  in  the  steel  sector  (van  Ruijven  et  al.  2016)  and  cement industry  (Sanjuán et  al.  2020)  than  in the  chemicals sector  (Daioglou  et  al.  2014).  Many  scenarios, including stringent mitigation scenarios, show continued growth in final energy; however, the carbon intensity of energy declines in all mitigation scenarios (Figure 3.26). The representation of the industry sector is very aggregate in most IAMs, with only a small subset of models disaggregating key sectors such as cement, fertilizer, chemicals, and iron and steel (Pauliuk et FOOTNOTE  14  2019  values  are  from  model  results  and  interpolated  from  other  years  when  not  directly reported. 3-63  Total pages: 156Page 72
 3.4.6Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Mitigation  pathways  show  substantial  reductions  in  CO2  emissions,  but  more  modest  reductions  in AFOLU CH4 and N2O emissions (high confidence) (Popp et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019; Reisinger et al. 2021) (Figure 3.27). Pathways limiting warming to likely 2C or below are projected to reach net zero CO2  emissions  in  the  AFOLU  sector  around  2033  (2024-2060);  however  AFOLU  CH4  and  N2O emissions  remain  positive  in  all  pathways  (Figure  3.27).  While  IAMs  include  many  land-based mitigation  options,  these  models  exclude  several  options  with  large  mitigation  potential,  such  as biochar,  agroforestry,  restoration/avoided  conversion  of  coastal  wetlands,  and  restoration/avoided conversion  of  peatland  (Smith  et  al.  2019;  IPCC  2019a)  (see  also  Chapter  7,  Section  3.4).  Sectoral studies show higher mitigation potential than IAM pathways, as these studies include more mitigation options than IAMs (medium confidence) (Chapter 7).  FOOTNOTE  15  Some  studies  calculate  emissions  reductions  in  2050  compared  to  2014,  while  others  note emissions reductions in 2060 relative to 2018. 3-64  Total pages: 156Page 73
 Figure 3.27: Reduction in AFOLU GHG emissions from 2019. The AFOLU CO2 estimates in this figure are not necessarily comparable with country GHG inventories (see Chapter 7).  Limiting warming to likely 2C or below can result in large scale transformation of the land surface (high confidence) (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Brown et al. 2019; Roe et al. 2019). The scale of land transformation depends,  inter alia, on the temperature goal and the mitigation options included  (Popp  et  al.  2017;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018a;  IPCC  2019a).  Pathways  with  more  demand-side mitigation options show less land transformation than those with more limited options (van Vuuren et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a). Most of these pathways show increases in forest cover, with  an  increase  of  322  million  ha  (-67  to  890  million  ha)  in  2050  in  1.5°C  pathways  with  no  or limited overshoot, whereas bottom up models portray an economic potential of 300-500 million ha of additional  forest  (Chapter  7).  Many  IAM  pathways  also  include  large  amounts  of  energy  cropland area,  to  supply  biomass  for  bioenergy  and  BECCS,  with  199  (56-482)  million  ha  in  2050  in  1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. Large land transformations, such as afforestation/reforestation and  widespread  planting  of  energy  crops,  can  have  implications  for  biodiversity  and  sustainable development (see Section 3.7, Chapter 7 - Subsection 7.7.4, Chapter 12 - Section 12.5). 3-65  Total pages: 156Figure 3.28: Change in Land Cover from 2019 in million hectares. Positive values indicate an increase in area.  Delayed  mitigation  has  implications  for  land  use  transitions  (Hasegawa  et  al.  2021a).  Delaying mitigation action  can  result  in  a temporary  overshoot  of temperature and large-scale  deployment of CDR in the second half of the century to reduce temperatures from their peak to a given level (Smith et  al.  2019;  Hasegawa  et  al.  2021a).  IAM  pathways  rely  on  afforestation  and  BECCS  as  CDR measures, so  delayed mitigation action results in substantial land use change in the second half of the century with implications for sustainable development (Hasegawa et al. 2021a) (see also Section 3.7). Shifting to earlier mitigation action reduces the amount of land required for this, though at the cost of larger  land  use  transitions  earlier  in  the  century  (Hasegawa  et  al.  2021a).  Earlier  action  could  also reduce climate impacts on agriculture and land-based mitigation options (Smith et al. 2019). Some AFOLU mitigation options can enhance vegetation and soil carbon stocks such as reforestation, restoration of degraded ecosystems, protection of ecosystems with high carbon stocks and changes to agricultural land management to increase soil carbon (high confidence) (Fuss et al. 2018; Griscom et al.  2017;  de  Coninck  et  al.  2018;  Smith  et  al.  2019)  (WGIII  Chapter  7).  The  timescales  associated with  these  options  indicate  that  carbon  sinks  in  terrestrial  vegetation  and  soil  systems  can  be maintained or enhanced so as to contribute towards long-term mitigation (high confidence); however, many AFOLU mitigation options do not continue to sequester carbon indefinitely (IPCC 2019a; Fuss et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018)(WGIII Chapter 7). In the very long term (latter part of the century and  beyond),  it  will  become  more  challenging  to  continue  to  enhance  vegetation  and  soil  carbon stocks, so that the associated carbon sinks could diminish or even become sources (high confidence) (IPCC  2019a;  de  Coninck  et  al.  2018)  (WGI  Chapter  5).  Sustainable  forest  management,  including harvest and forest regeneration, can help to remediate and slow any decline in the forest carbon sink, for example by restoring degraded forest areas, and so go some way towards addressing the issue of sink saturation (IPCC 2019) (WGI Chapter 5; WGIII Chapter 7). The accumulated carbon resulting from  mitigation  options  that  enhance  carbon  sequestration  (e.g.,  reforestation,  soil  carbon sequestration) is also at risk of future loss due to disturbances (e.g., fire, pests) (Anderegg et al. 2020; Boysen et al. 2017; IPCC 2019a; Smith et al. 2019; Fuss et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018)(WGI 3-66  Total pages: 1563.4.7Other Carbon Dioxide Removal Options Table 3.5: Carbon dioxide removal in assessed pathways.

After an  overview  of this relationship (3.5.1), it provides an assessment of what currently planned near-term action implies for limiting  warming  to  1.5-2°C  (3.5.2),  and  to  what  extent  pathways  with  accelerated  action  beyond current NDCs can improve the ability to keep long-term targets in reach (3.5.3). The assessment in this section shows that if mitigation ambitions in current NDCs16 are followed until 2030,  leading  to  estimated  emissions  of  47-57  GtCO2-eq  in  203017  (Chapter  4.2.2),  it  is  no  longer possible  to  stay  below  1.5°C  warming  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  (high  confidence).  Instead,  it would  entail  high  overshoot  (typically  >0.1oC)  and  reliance  on  net  negative  CO2  emissions  with uncertain  potential  to  return  warming  to  1.5°C  by  the  end  of  the  century.  It  would  also  strongly increase  mitigation  challenges  to  likely  limit  warming  to  2°C  (high  confidence).

The  literature  assessed in these two reports has focused on delayed action until 2030 in the context of limiting warming to 2°C (den Elzen et al. 2010; van Vuuren and Riahi 2011; Kriegler et al. 2015; Luderer et al. 2013, 2016; Riahi et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2013a) and 1.5°C (Strefler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2013b). Here  we  provide  an  update  of  these  assessments  drawing  on  the  most  recent  literature  on  global mitigation pathways. New studies have focused, inter alia, on constraining near term developments by peak  warming  limits  (Rogelj  et  al.  2019b;  Strefler  et  al.  2021b;  Riahi  et  al.  2021)  and  updating assumptions about near- and medium term emissions developments based on national plans and long-term  strategies  (Roelfsema  et  al.  2020)  (Chapter  4.2).  Several  studies  have  explored  new  types  of pathways  with  accelerated  action  bridging  between  current  policy  plans  and  the  goal  of  limiting warming below 2°C (Kriegler et al. 2018a; van Soest et al. 2021a) and looked at hybrid international policy regimes to phase in global collective action  (Bauer et al. 2020).  3.5.1Relationship  between  long-term  climate  goals  and  near-  to  medium-term  emissions reductions The  close  link  between  cumulative  CO2  emissions  and  warming  has  strong  implications  for  the relationship between near-, medium-, and long-term climate action to limit global warming. The AR6 WGI Assessment has estimated a remaining carbon budget of 500 (400) GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020 onwards for staying below 1.5°C with 50% (67%) likelihood, subject to additional uncertainties about  historic  warming  and  the  climate  response  and  variations  in  warming  from  non-CO2  climate forcers  (Canadell  and  Monteiro  2019)  (see  also  WGI  Chapter  5,  Section  5.5).  For  comparison,  if current CO2 emissions of more than 40 GtCO2 are keeping up until 2030, more than 400 GtCO2 will be emitted during 2021–2030, already exhausting the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C by 2030.  The relationship between warming limits and near term action is illustrated in Figure 3.29, using a set of  1.5-2°C  scenarios  with  different  levels  of  near  term  action,  overshoot  and  non-CO2  warming contribution from a recent study (Riahi et al. 2021). In general, the more CO2 is emitted until 2030, the less CO2 can be emitted thereafter to stay within a remaining carbon budget and below a warming limit. Scenarios with immediate action to observe the warming limit give the longest time to exhaust the associated remaining carbon budget and reach net zero CO2 emissions (light blue line in Figure 3.29, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). In comparison, following projected NDC emissions until 2030 would imply a more pronounced drop in emissions from 2030 levels to net zero to make up for the  additional  near-term  emissions (orange lines in Figure  3.29).  If such a  drop  does not occur, the remaining  carbon  budget  is  exceeded  and  net  negative  CO2  emissions  are  required  to  return  global mean temperature below the warming limit (black lines in Figure 3.29) (Fuss et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018a). FOOTNOTE  18  In  this  section,  near  term  emissions  outcomes  are  often  compared  to  near  term  emissions  in mitigation  pathways  with  immediate  action  towards  a  warming  limit.  These  are  defined  as  pathways  that immediately  after  imposing  the  warming  limit  turn  to  global  mitigation  action  tapping  into  all  least  cost abatement options available globally. These pathways are often called cost-effective or least-cost pathways in the literature. The onset of immediate action is defined by scenario design and is typically chosen to be the first time step after 2020 in immediate action scenarios assessed in this report.   3-69  Total pages: 1563-70  Total pages: 156Figure 3.29: Illustration of emissions and climate response in four mitigation pathways with different assumptions about near term policy developments, global warming limit and non-CO2 warming contribution drawn from Riahi et al. (2021). Shown are (a) CO2 emissions trajectories, (b) cumulative CO2 emissions, (c) effective non-CO2 radiative forcing, and (d) the resulting estimate of the 67th percentile of global mean temperature response relative to 1850-1900. Light blue lines show a scenario that acts immediately on a remaining carbon budget of 900 GtCO2 from 2020 without allowing net negative CO2 emissions, i.e., temporary budget overshoot (COFFEE 1.1, Scenario EN_NPi2020_900). Orange and black lines show scenarios drawn from the same model that follow the NDCs until 2030 and thereafter introduce action to stay within the same budget – in one case excluding net negative CO2 emissions like before (orange lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900) and in the other allowing for a temporary overshoot of the carbon budget until 2100 (black lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900f). Light blue lines describe a scenario following the NDCs until 2030, and then aiming for a higher budget of 2300 GtCO2 without overshoot (AIM/CGE 2.2, Scenario EN-INDCi2030_1200). It is drawn from another model which projects a lower anthropogenic non-CO2 forcing contribution and therefore achieves about the same temperature outcome as the other two non-overshoot scenarios despite the higher CO2 budget. Grey funnels include the trajectories from all scenarios that likely limit warming to 2°C (Category C3). Historical CO2 emissions until 2019 are from Chapter SM.2.1 EDGAR v6.0. The  relationship  between  long-term  climate  goals  and  near  term  action  is  further  constrained  by social,  technological,  economic  and  political  factors  (Aghion  et  al.  2019;  Mercure  et  al.  2019;  van Sluisveld  et  al.  2018b;  Cherp  et  al.  2018;  Jewell  and  Cherp  2020;  Trutnevyte  et  al.  2019b).  These factors influence path dependency and transition speed  (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Pahle et al. 2018). While  detailed  integrated  assessment  modelling  of  global  mitigation  pathways  accounts  for technology  inertia  (Bertram  et  al.  2015a;  Mercure  et  al.  2018)  and  technology  innovation  and diffusion (Wilson et al. 2013; van Sluisveld et al. 2018a; Luderer et al. 2021), there are limitations in capturing  socio-technical  and  political  drivers  of  innovation,  diffusion  and  transition  processes (Keppo et al. 2021; Gambhir et al. 2019; Hirt et al. 2020; Köhler et al. 2019). Mitigation pathways show a wide range of transition speeds that have been interrogated in the context of socio-technical 3-71  Total pages: 1563.5.2Implications  of  near-term  emission  levels  for  keeping  long-term  climate  goals  within reach The  implications  of  near-term  climate  action  for  long-term  climate  outcomes  can  be  explored  by comparing mitigation pathways with different near-term emissions developments aiming for the same climate target (Vrontisi et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2015; Roelfsema et al. 2020). A particular example is the  comparison  of  cost-effective  pathways  with immediate  action  to limit  warming  to  1.5-2°C  with mitigation pathways pursuing more moderate mitigation action until 2030. After the adoption of the Paris  Agreement,  near  term  action  was  often  modelled  to  reflect  conditional  and  unconditional elements  of  originally  submitted  NDCs  (2015-2019)  (Fawcett  et  al.  2015;  Fujimori  et  al.  2016a; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Vrontisi et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020). The most recent modelling studies also  include  submission of  updated  NDCs  or  announcements  of  planned  updates  in the  first  half  of 2021 (Network for  Greening  the  Financial  System  2021;  Riahi et al.  2021).  Emissions levels  under current  NDCs  (see  footnote  15)  are  assessed  to  range  between  47–57  GtCO2-eq  in  2030  (Chapter 4.2.2). This assessed range corresponds well to 2030 emissions levels in 2°C mitigation pathways in the  literature  that  are  designed  to  follow  the  original  or  current  NDCs  until  203019.  For  the  139 scenarios  of  this  kind  that  are  collected  in  the  AR6  scenario  database  and  that  still  likely  limit warming  to  2°C,  the  2030  emissions  range  is  52.5  (44.5-57)  GtCO2-eq  (based  on  native  model reporting) and 52 (46.5-56) GtCO2-eq, respectively (based on harmonized emissions data for climate assessment (Annex III part II section 2.4); median and 5th to 95th percentile). This close match allows a  robust  assessment  of  the  implications  of  implementing  current  NDCs  for  post-2030  mitigation efforts and warming outcomes based on the literature and the AR6 scenarios database. The  assessed  emission ranges  from  implementing  the  unconditional (unconditional  and  conditional) elements  of  current  NDCs  implies  an  emissions  gap  to  cost-effective  mitigation  pathways  of  20-26 (16-24) GtCO2-eq in 2030 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and 10-17 (7-14) GtCO2-eq in 2030 for likely limiting warming to 2°C (Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in chapter 2). The emissions gap gives rise to a number of mitigation challenges (Rogelj et al. 2013a; Kriegler et al. 2013a, 2018b,a; Riahi et al. 2015; Luderer et al. 2013, 2018; Fujimori et al. 2016b; Fawcett et al. 2015; Strefler et al. 2018; Winning et al. 2019; UNEP 2020; SEI et al. 2020): (i) larger transitional challenges  post-2030  to  still  remain  under  the  warming  limit  (,  in  particular  higher  CO2  emissions reduction  rates  and  technology  transition  rates  required  during  2030-2050;  (ii)  larger  lock-in  into carbon-intensive  infrastructure  and  increased  risk  of  stranded  fossil  fuel  assets  (3.5.2.2);  and  (iii) larger reliance on CDR to reach net zero CO2 more rapidly and compensate excess emissions in the second  half  of  the  century  (3.5.2.1).  All  these  factors  exacerbate  socio-economic  strain  of FOOTNOTE  19  The  intended design  of mitigation pathways in  the  literature  can  be deduced  from  underlying publications  and  study  protocols.  This  information  was  collected  as  part  of  this  assessment  to  establish  a categorization  of  policy  assumptions  underpinning  the  mitigation  pathways  collected  in  the  AR6  scenario database (3.2; Annex III Part II section 3.2).  3-72  Total pages: 1562030 emissions levels in the NDC range also tighten the remaining space to likely limit warming 2°C. As shown in Figure 3.30b, the 67th percentile of peak warming reaches values above 1.7°C warming in pathways with 2030 emissions levels in this range. To still have a likely chance to stay below 2°C, the global post-2030 GHG emission reduction rates would need to be abruptly raised in 2030 from 0-0.8 GtCO2-eq yr-1 to an average of 1.3-2.1 GtCO2-eq yr-1 during the period 2030-2050 (Figure 3.30c), around 70% of that in immediate mitigation pathways confirming findings in the literature (Winning et al. 2019). Their average reduction rate of 0.6-1.4 GtCO2 yr-1 would already be unprecedented at the global  scale  and  with  a  few  exceptions  national  scale  for  an  extended  period  of  time  (Riahi  et  al. 2015).  For  comparison,  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  global  economy  is  projected  to  lead  to  a decline  of  ca.  2.5-3  GtCO2  of  global  CO2  emissions  from  fossil  fuel  and  industry  in  2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) (Chapter 2.2). The increased post-2030 transition challenge in mitigation pathways with moderate near term action is also reflected in the timing of reaching net zero CO2 emissions (Figure 3.30d and Table 3.6) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). As 2030 emission levels and the cumulated CO2 emissions until 2030 increase, the remaining  time for  dropping  to  net  zero  CO2  and  staying  within the  remaining carbon budget shortens (Figure 3.29). This gives rise to an inverted v-shape of the lower bound on the year of reaching net zero as a function of 2030 emissions levels. Reaching low in 2030 facilitates reaching net zero early (left leg of the inverted v), but staying high until 2030 also requires to reach net zero CO2 faster  to  compensate  for  higher  emissions  early  on  (right  leg  of  the  inverted  v).  Overall,  there  is  a considerable spread of the timing of net zero CO2 for any 2030 emissions level due to variation in the timing  of  spending  the  remaining  carbon  budget  and  the  non-CO2  warming  contribution  (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). 3-73  Total pages: 156Figure 3.30: Relationship between level of global GHG emissions in 2030 and selected indicators as listed in the panel titles for scenarios collected in the AR6 scenario database.

The large majority of blue coloured scenarios act immediately on the temperature target, while red coloured scenarios depict all those that were designed to follow the NDCs or lesser action until 2030 and orange coloured scenarios comprise a small set of pathways with additional regulatory action beyond NDCs (3.5.3).

Dotted lines are inserted in some panels to highlight trends in the dependency of selected output variables on 2030 GHG emissions levels (see text) There is also a profound impact on the underlying transition of energy and land use (Table 3.6 and Figure 3.30f-h). Scenarios following NDCs until 2030 show a much smaller reduction in fossil fuel use, only half of the growth in renewable energy use, and a smaller reduction in CO2 and CH4 land use emissions in 2030 compared to immediate action scenarios. This is then followed by a much faster reduction  of  land  use  emissions  and fossil  fuels,  and a  larger  increase  of  nuclear  energy, bioenergy and non-biomass renewable energy during the medium term in order to get close to the levels of the 3-74  Total pages: 156Table 3.6: Comparison of key scenario characteristics for four scenario classes (see Table 3.2): (i) immediate action to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, (ii) near team action following the NDCs until 2030 and returning warming to below 1.5°C (50% chance) by 2100 with high overshoot, (iii) immediate action to likely limit warming to 2°C, and (iv) near term action following the NDCs until 2030 followed by post-2030 action to likely limit warming to 2°C.

Some pathways that return median warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century show mid-century overshoots of up to 1.8°C median warming. The overshoot tends to be the higher, the higher 2030 emissions. Mitigation pathways with 2030 emissions levels in the NDC  range  consistently  overshoot  1.5°C  by  0.15-0.3°C.  This  leads  to  higher  risks  from  climate change impacts during the time of overshoot compared to pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (Tachiiri et al. 2019; Hofmann et al. 2019; Schleussner et al. 2016a; Mengel et al. 2018; Drouet et al. 2021; Lenton et al. 2019). Furthermore, even if warming is reversed by net negative  emissions,  other  climate  changes  such  as  sea  level  rise  would  continue  in  their  current direction for decades to millennia (WGI Chapter 4.6 and Chapter 5.6). Returning  warming  to  lower  levels  requires  net  negative  CO2  emissions  in  the  second  half  of  the century (Fuss et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018a). The amount of net negative CO2 emissions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5-2°C climate goals varies widely, with some pathways not deploying net negative CO2 emissions at all and others deploying up to -600 to -800 GtCO2. The amount of net negative CO2 emissions tends to increase with 2030 emissions levels (Figure 3.30e and Table  3.6).  Studies  confirmed  the  ability  of  net  negative  CO2  emissions  to  reduce  warming,  but pointed to path dependencies in the storage of carbon and heat in the Earth system and  the need for further research particularly for cases of high overshoot (Keller et al. 2018a,b; Tokarska et al. 2019; Zickfeld  et  al.  2016,  2021).  WGI  assessed  the  reduction  in  global  surface  temperature  to  be approximately  linearly  related  to  cumulative  CO2  removal  and,  with  lower  confidence,  that  the amount  of  cooling  per  unit  CO2  removed  is  approximately  independent  of  the  rate  and  amount  of removal (WGI TS.3.3.2). Still there remains large uncertainty about a potential asymmetry between the  warming  response  to  CO2  emissions  and  the  cooling  response  to  net  negative  CO2  emissions (Zickfeld  et  al.  2021).  It  was  also  shown  that  warming  can  adversely  affect  the  efficacy  of  carbon dioxide removal measures and hence the ability to achieve net negative CO2 emissions (Boysen et al. 2016). In  addition  to  enabling a  temporary  budget  overshoot  by  net  negative  CO2  emissions  in the  second half  of  the  century,  CDR  can  also  be  used  to  compensate  –  on  an  annual  basis  -  residual  CO2 emissions  from  sources  that  are  difficult  to  eliminate  and  to  reach  net  zero  CO2  emissions  more rapidly  if  deployed  before  this  point  (Kriegler  et  al.  2013b;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018a).  This  explains  its continued deployment in pathways that exclude overshoot and net negative CO2 emissions (Riahi et al.  2021).  However,  given  the  timescales  that  would  likely  be  needed  to  ramp-up  CDR  to  Gigaton scale (Nemet et al. 2018), it can be expected to only make a limited contribution to reaching net zero CO2 as fast as possible. In the vast majority (95%) of 1.5-2°C mitigation pathways assessed in this report,  cumulative  CDR  deployment  did  not exceed  100  GtCO2  until mid-century.  This  adds to  the risk  of  excessively  relying  on  CDR  to  compensate  for  weak  mitigation  action  until  2030  by  either facilitating massive net CO2 emissions reduction rates during 2030-2050 or allowing a high temporary overshoot  of  1.5°C  until  the  end  of  the  century.  If  international  burden  sharing  considerations  are taken  into  account,  the  CDR  penalty  for  weak  action  could  increase  further,  in  particular  for developed  countries  (Fyson  et  al.  2020).  Further  assessment  of  CDR  deployment  in  1.5-2°C mitigation pathways is found in Section 3.4.7. 3.5.2.2Carbon lock-in and stranded assets There  already  exists  a  substantial  and  growing  carbon  lock-in  today,  as  measured  by  committed emissions  associated  with  existing  long-lived  infrastructure  {Chapter  2.7,  Figure  2.31}.  If  existing fossil-fuel  infrastructure  would  continue  to  be  operated  as  historically,  they  would  entail  CO2 emissions  exceeding  the  carbon  budget  for  1.5°C  {Chapter  2.7.2,  Figure  2.32}.  However,  owner-operators  and  societies  may  choose  to  retire  existing  infrastructure  earlier  than  in  the  past,  and committed  emissions  are  thus  contingent  on  the  competitiveness  of  non-emitting  alternative technologies and climate policy ambition. Therefore, in mitigation pathways, some infrastructure may become  stranded  assets.  Stranded  assets  have  been  defined  as  “assets  that  have  suffered  from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities” (Caldecott 2017).  A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized quantification of stranded-assets in the mitigation pathways literature, and showed that (i) coal power plants are the most exposed to risk  of  becoming  stranded,  (ii)  delayed  mitigation  action  increases  stranded  assets  and  (iii)  sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets differ between countries (Fisch-Romito et al. 2020). There is  high  agreement  that  existing  fossil  fuel  infrastructure  would  need  to  be  retired  earlier  than historically, used less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon budgets of limiting warming  to  1.5°C  or  2°C  (Johnson  et  al.  2016;  Kefford  et  al.  2018;  Pfeiffer  et  al.  2018;  Cui  et  al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Studies estimate that cumulative early retired power plant  capacities  by  2060  can  be  up  to  600  GW  for  gas  and  1700  GW  for  coal  (Iyer  et  al.  2015a; Kefford et al. 2018), that only 42% of the total capital stock of both operating and planned coal-fired powers plants can be utilized to be compatible with the 2°C target (Pfeiffer et al. 2018), and that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2°C or 1.5°C retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case (Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020). After coal,  electricity  production  based  on  gas  is  also  projected  to  be  phased  out,  with  some  capacity remaining  as  back-up  (van  Soest  et  al.  2017a).  Kefford  et  al.  (2018)  find  USD541  billion  worth  of stranded fossil fuel power plants could be created by 2060, with China and India the most exposed.  Some publications have suggested that stranded long-lived assets may be even more important outside of the power sector. While stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD1.8 trillion in scenarios consistent with a 2°C target, Saygin et al. (2019) found a range of USD5-11 trillion in the buildings  sectors.  Muldoon-Smith  and  Greenhalgh  (2019)  have  even  estimated  a  potential  value  at risk for global real estate assets up to USD21 trillion. More broadly, the set of economic activities that are  potentially  affected  by  a  low  carbon  transition  is  wide  and  includes  also  energy-intensive industries,  transport  and  housing,  as  reflected  in  the  concept  of  climate  policy  relevant  sectors introduced  in  Battiston  et  al.  (2017).  The  sectoral  distribution  and  amount  of  stranded  assets  differ across  countries  (Fisch-Romito  et  al.  2020).  Capital  for  fossil  fuel  production  and  distribution represents a larger share of potentially stranded assets in fossil fuel producing countries such as the United  States  and  Russia.  Electricity  generation  would  be  a  larger  share  of  total  stranded  assets  in emerging  countries  because  this  capital  is  relatively  new  compared  to  its  operational  lifetime. Conversely,  buildings  could  represent  a  larger  part  of  stranded  capital  in  more  developed  countries such as the United States, EU or even Russia because of high market value and low turnover rate.  Many quantitative estimates of stranded assets along mitigation pathways have focused on fossil fuel power  plants  in  pathways  characterized  by  mitigation  ambition  until  2030  corresponding  to  the current NDCs followed by strengthened action afterwards to limit warming to 2°C or lower (Bertram et  al.  2015a;  Iyer  et  al.  2015b;  Lane  et  al.  2016;  Farfan  and  Breyer  2017;  van  Soest  et  al.  2017a; Luderer  et  al.  2018;  Kriegler  et  al.  2018a;  Cui  et  al.  2019;  Saygin  et  al.  2019;  SEI  et  al.  2020). Pathways following current NDCs until 2030 do not show a significant reduction of coal, oil and gas use (Figure 3.30f-h, Table 3.6) compared to immediate action pathways. Stranded coal power assets are evaluated to be higher by a factor of 2-3 if action is strengthened after 2030 rather than now (Iyer et al. 2015b; Cui et al. 2019). There is high agreement that the later climate policies are implemented, the higher the expected stranded assets and the societal, economic and political strain of strengthening action. Associated price increases for carbon-intensive goods and transitional macro-economic costs have been found to scale with the emissions gap in 2030 (Kriegler et al. 2013a). At the aggregate level of the whole global economy, Rozenberg et al. (2015) showed that each year of delaying the start of mitigation decreases the required CO2 intensity of new production by 20-50 gCO2/USD. Carbon lock-in  can  have  a  long-lasting  effect  on  future  emissions  trajectories  after  2030.  Luderer  et  al.  (2018) compared cost-effective pathways with immediate action to limit warming to 1.5-2°C with pathways following  the  NDCs  until  2030  and  adopting  the  pricing  policy  of  the  cost-effective  pathways thereafter and found that the majority of additional CO2 emissions from carbon lock-in occurs after 2030,  reaching  a  cumulative  amount  of  290  (160–330)  GtCO2  by  2100  (2.7.2).  Early  action  and avoidance of investments in new carbon-intensive assets can minimize these risks.  The risk of stranded assets has implications for workers depending from those assets, asset owners, assets  portfolio  managers,  financial  institutions  and  the  stability  of  the  financial  system.  Chapter  6 assesses the risks and implications of stranded assets for energy systems (6.7.3, Box 6.11) and fossil fuels  (6.7.4).  The  implications  of  stranded  assets  for  inequality  and  just  transition  are  assessed  in Chapter 17 (17.3.2.3). Chapter 15 assesses the literature on those implications for the financial system as well as on coping options (15.5.2, 15.6.1). On the other hand, mitigation, by limiting climate change, reduces the risk of destroyed or stranded assets  from  the  physical  impacts  of  climate  change  on  natural  and  human  systems,  from  more frequent,  intense  or  extended  extreme  events  and  from  sea  level  rise  (O’Neill  et  al.  2020a).  The literature on mitigation pathways rarely includes an evaluation of stranded assets from climate change impacts.  Unruh  (Unruh  2019)  suggest  that  these  are  the  real  stranded  assets  of  carbon  lock-in  and could prove much more costly.  3.5.2.3Global accelerated action towards long-term climate goals A growing literature explores long-term mitigation pathways with accelerated near-term action going beyond  the  NDCs  (Jiang  et  al.  2017;  Roelfsema  et  al.  2018;  Graichen  et  al.  2017;  Kriegler  et  al. 2018a; van Soest et al. 2021a; Fekete et al. 2021). Global accelerated action pathways are designed to transition more gradually from current policies and planned implementation of NDCs onto a 1.5-2°C pathway  and  at  the  same  time  alleviate  the  abrupt  transition  in  2030  that  would  be  caused  by following the NDCs until 2030 and strengthening towards limiting warming to 2°C thereafter (Section 3.5.2). Therefore they have sometimes been called bridging scenarios / pathways in the literature (IEA 2011; Spencer et al. 2015; van Soest et al. 2021a). They rely on regionally differentiated regulatory and  pricing  policies  to  gradually  strengthening  regional  and  sectoral  action  beyond  the  mitigation ambition in the NDCs. There are limitations to this approach. The tighter the warming limit, the more is  disruptive  action  becoming  inevitable  to  achieve  the  speed  of  transition  that  would  be  required (Kriegler  et  al.  2018a).  Cost  effective  pathways  already  have  abrupt  shifts  in  deployments, investments  and  prices  at  the  time  a  stringent  warming  limit  is  imposed  reflecting  the  fact  that  the overall response to climate change has so far been misaligned with long-term climate goals (Geiges et al. 2019; Rogelj et al. 2016; Fawcett et al. 2015; Schleussner et al. 2016b). Disruptive action can help to break lock-ins and enable transformative change (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018). The large literature on accelerating climate action was assessed in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C Warming (de Coninck et al. 2018) and is taken up in this report primarily in Chapters 4, 13, and 14. Accelerating climate action and facilitating transformational change requires a perspective on socio-technical  transitions  (Geels  et  al.  2016b;  Geels  2018;  Geels  et  al.  2016a),  a  portfolio  of  policy instruments to manage technological and environmental change (Goulder and Parry 2008; Fischer and Newell  2008;  Acemoglu  et  al.  2012,  2016),  a  notion  of  path  dependency  and  policy  sequencing (Meckling et al. 2017; Pahle et al. 2018; Pierson 2000) and the evolvement of poly-centric governance layers of institutions and norms in support of the transformation  (Messner 2015; Leach et al. 2007; Dietz et al. 2003). This subsection is focused on an assessment of the emerging quantitative literature on  global  accelerated  action  pathways  towards  1.5-2°C,  which  to  a  large  extent  abstracts  from  the underlying  processes  and  uses  a  number  of  stylized  approaches  to  generate  these  pathways.  A representative of accelerated action pathways has been identified as one of the illustrative mitigation pathways in this assessment (GS, Figure 3.31). One  approach  relies  on  augmenting  initially  moderate  emissions  pricing  policies  with  robust anticipation of ratcheting up climate action in the future  (Spencer et al. 2015). If announcements of strong future climate policies are perceived to be credible, they can help to prevent carbon lock-in as investors  anticipating  high  future  costs  of  GHG  emissions  would  reduce  investment  into  fossil  fuel infrastructure,  such  as  coal  power  plants  (Bauer  et  al.  2018b).  However,  the  effectiveness  of  such announcements strongly hinges on their credibility. If investors believe that policy makers could drop them if anticipatory action did not occur, they may not undertake such action. Another  approach  relies  on  international  cooperation  to  strengthen  near  term  climate  action.  These studies  build  on  international  climate  policy  architectures  that  could  incentivize  a  coalition  of  like-minded  countries  to  raise  their  mitigation  ambition  beyond  what  is  stated  in  their  current  NDC (Graichen  et al.  2017).  Examples are the idea  of  climate  clubs characterized  by  harmonized carbon and technology markets (Pihl 2020; Nordhaus 2015; Keohane et al. 2017; Paroussos et al. 2019) and the Powering Past Coal Alliance (Jewell et al. 2019). Paroussos et al. (2019) find economic benefits of joining  a  climate  club  despite  the  associated  higher  mitigation  effort,  in  particular  due  to  access  to technology and climate finance. Graichen et al. (2017) find an additional reduction of 5-11 GtCO2eq compared to the mitigation ambition in the NDCs from the successful implementation of international climate  initiatives.  Other  studies  assess  benefits  from  international  transfers  of mitigation  outcomes (Stua  2017;  Edmonds  et  al.  2021).  Edmonds  et  al.  (2021)  find  economic  gains  from  sharing  NDC emissions  reduction  commitments  compared  to  purely  domestic  implementation  of  NDCs.  If reinvested in mitigation efforts, the study projects an additional reduction of 9 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2030. The most common approach relies on strengthening regulatory policies beyond current policy trends, also  motivated  by  the  finding  that  such  policies  have  so  far  been  employed  more  often  than comprehensive carbon pricing (Roelfsema et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018a; van Soest et al. 2021a; Fekete et al. 2021; IEA 2021a). Some studies have focused on generic regulatory policies such as low carbon  support  policies,  fossil  fuel  sunset  policies,  and  resource  efficiency  policies  (Bertram  et  al. 2015b;  Hatfield-Dodds  et  al.  2017).  Bertram  et  al.  (2015b)  found  that  a  moderate  carbon  price combined  with  a  coal  moratorium  and  ambitious  low  carbon  support  policies  can  limit  efficiency losses until 2030 if emissions pricing is raised thereafter to limit warming to 2°C. They also showed that all three components are needed to achieve this outcome. Hatfield-Dodds et al. (2017) found that resource  efficiency  can  lower  2050  emissions  by  an  additional  15-20%  while  boosting  near-term economic  growth.  The  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA  2021a)  developed  a  detailed  net  zero scenario for the global energy sector characterized by a rapid phase out of fossil fuels, a massive clean energy  and electrification push,  and  the  stabilization of  energy  demand, leading  to  10  GtCO2  lower emissions from energy use in 2030 than in a scenario following the announced pledges. The  Paris  Agreement  has  spurred  the  formulation  of  NDCs  for  2030  and  mid-century  strategies around  the  world  (cf.  Chapter  4).  This  is  giving  researchers  a  rich  empirical  basis  to  formulate accelerated policy packages taking national decarbonisation pathways as a starting point (van Soest et al. 2017b; Waisman et al. 2019; Graichen et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017). The concept is to identify good  practice  policies  that  had  demonstrable  impact  on  pushing  low  carbon  options  or  reducing emissions  in  a  country  or  region  and  then  consider  a  wider  roll-out  of  these  policies  taking  into account regional specificities (den Elzen et al. 2015; Kuramochi et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Fekete et al. 2015, 2021). A challenge for this approach is to account for the fact that  policy  effectiveness  varies  with  different  political  environments  in  different  geographies.  As  a result, a global roll-out of good practice policies to close the emissions gap will still be an idealized benchmark, but it is useful to understand how much could be gained from it. Accelerated action pathways derived with this approach show considerable scope for narrowing the emissions  gap  between  pathways  reflecting  the  ambition  level  of  the  NDCs  and  cost-effective mitigation  pathways  in  2030.  Kriegler  et  al.  (2018a)  find  around  10  GtCO2eq  lower  emissions compared  to  original  NDCs  from  a  global  roll-out  of  good  practice  plus  net  zero  policies  and  a moderate  increase  in  regionally  differentiated  carbon  pricing.  Fekete  et  al.  (2021)  show  that  global replication of sector progress in five major economies would reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by about 20%  compared  to  a  current  policy  scenario.  These  findings  were  found  in  good  agreement  with  a recent model comparison study based on results from 9 integrated assessment models (van Soest et al. 2021a). Based on these three studies, implementing accelerated action in terms of a global roll out of regulatory and moderate pricing policies is assessed to lead to global GHG emissions of 47 (38-51) GtCO2-eq in 2030 (median and 5th to 95th percentile based on 10 distinct modelled pathways). This closes the implementation gap for the NDCs, and in addition falls below the emissions range implied by  implementing  unconditional  and  conditional  elements  of  NDCs  by  3-9  GtCO2-eq.  However,  it does not close the emissions gap to immediate action pathways likely limiting warming to 2°C, and, based on our assessment in Section 3.5.2, emission levels above 40 GtCO2-eq in 2030 still have a very low prospect for keeping limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot in reach.   Figure 3.31 shows the intermediate position of accelerated action pathways derived by van Soest et al. (2021a)  between  pathways  that  follow  the  NDCs  until  2030  and  immediate  action  pathways  likely limiting warming to 2°C. Accelerated action is able to reduce the abrupt shifts in emissions, fossil fuel use  and  low  carbon  power  generation  in  2030  and  also  limits  peak  warming  more  effectively  than NDC  pathways.  But  primarily  due  to  the  moderate  carbon  price  assumptions  (Fig.  3.31b),  the reductions  in  emissions  and  particular  fossil  fuel  use  are  markedly  smaller  than  what  would  be obtained in the case of immediate action. The assessment shows that accelerated action until 2030 can have  significant  benefits  in  terms  of  reducing  the  mitigation  challenges  from  following  the  NDCs until  2030.  But  putting  a  significant  value  on  GHG  emissions  reductions  globally  remains  a  key element of moving onto 1.5-2°C pathways. The vast majority of pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, independently of their differences in near term emission developments, converge to a global mitigation  regime  putting  such  a  significant  value  on  GHG  emission  reductions  in  all  regions  and sectors. Figure 3.31:Comparison of (i) pathways with immediate action likely limiting warming to 2°C (Immediate, light blue), (ii) pathways following the NDCs until 2030 and aiming to likely stay below 2°C thereafter (NDC; orange) and (iii) pathways accelerating near term action until 2030 beyond NDC ambition levels and aiming to likely stay below 2°C thereafter (Accelerated) for selected indicators as listed in the panel titles, based on pathways from van Soest et al. (2021a). Low carbon electricity comprises renewable and nuclear power. Indicator ranges are shown as boxplots (full range, interquartile range, and median) for the years 2030, 2050 and 2100 (absolute values) and for the periods 2020-2030, 2030-2050 (change indicators). Ranges are based on nine models participating in (van Soest et al. 2021a) with only 7 models reporting emissions and climate results and 8 models reporting carbon prices. The purple dot denotes the illustrative mitigation pathway GS that was part of the study by van Soest et al. 3.6Economics  of  long-term  mitigation  and  development  pathways, including mitigation costs and benefits A  complete  appraisal  of  economic  effects  and  welfare  effects  at  different  temperature  levels  would include  the  macroeconomic  impacts  of  investments  in  low-carbon  solutions  and  structural  change away  from  emitting  activities,  co-benefits  and  adverse  side  effects  of  mitigation,  (avoided)  climate Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII damages, as well as (reduced) adaptation costs, with high temporal, spatial and social heterogeneity using a harmonized framework. If no such complete appraisal in a harmonized framework exists, key elements are emerging from the literature, and assessed in the following subsections: on aggregated economy-wide global mitigation costs (section 3.6.1), on the economic benefits of avoiding climate impacts (section 3.6.2), on economic benefits and costs associated with mitigation co-benefits and co-harms (section 3.6.3) and on the distribution of economic implications between economic sectors and actors (section 3.6.4).  3.6.1Economy-wide implications of mitigation 3.6.1.1Global economic effects of mitigation and carbon values in mitigation pathways START BOX HERE Box 3.5 Concepts and modelling frameworks used for quantifying macro-economic effects of mitigation Most studies that have developed mitigation pathways have used a Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework,  which  aim  at  comparing  the  costs  of  different  mitigation  strategies  designed  to  meet  a given climate change mitigation goal (e.g., an emission-reduction target or a temperature stabilization target)  but  does  not  represent  economic  impacts  from  climate  change  itself,  nor  the  associated economic  benefits  of  avoided  impacts.  Other  studies  use  modelling  frameworks  that  represent  the feedback  of  damages  from  climate  change  on  the  economy  in  a  Cost-benefit  analysis  (CBA) approach, which balances mitigation costs and benefits. This second type of studies is represented in section 3.6.2. The  marginal  abatement  cost  of  carbon,  also  called  carbon  price,  is  determined  by  the  mitigation target  under  consideration:  it  describes  the  cost  of  reducing  the  last  unit  of  emissions  to  reach  the target  at  a  given  point  in  time.  Total  macro-economic  mitigation  costs  (or  gains)  aggregate  the economy-wide  impacts  of  investments  in  low-carbon  solutions  and  structural  changes  away  from emitting activities. The total macro-economic effects of mitigation pathways are reported in terms of variations  in  economic  output  or  consumption  levels,  measured  against  a  Reference  Scenario,  also called Baseline, at various points in time or discounted over a given time period. Depending on the study,  the  Reference  Scenario  reflects  specific  assumptions  about  patterns  of  socio-economic development and assumes either no climate policies or the climate policies in place or planned at the time  the  study  was  carried  out.  When  available  in  the  AR6  scenarios  database,  this  second  type  of Reference Scenario, with current policies, has been chosen for computation of mitigation costs. In the vast majority of studies that have produced the body of work on the cost of mitigation assessed here, and  in  particular  in  all  studies  that  have  submitted  global  scenarios  to  the  AR6  scenarios  database except (Schultes et al. 2021), the feedbacks of climate change impacts on the economic development pathways are not accounted for. This omission of climate impacts leads to overly optimistic economic projections in the reference scenarios, in particular in reference scenarios with no or limited mitigation action where the extent of global warming is the greatest. Mitigation cost estimates computed against no or limited policy reference scenarios therefore omit economic benefits brought by avoided climate change  impact  along  mitigation  pathways,  and  should  be  interpreted  with  care  (Grant  et  al.  2020). When  aggregate  economic  benefits  from  avoided  climate  change  impacts  are  accounted  for, mitigation is a welfare-enhancing strategy (see section 3.6.2). If  GDP  or  consumption  in  mitigation  pathways  are  below  the  reference  scenario  levels,  they  are reported as losses or macro-economic costs. Such cost estimates give an indication on how economic activity slows relative to the reference scenario; they do not necessarily describe, in absolute terms, a reduction  of  economic  output  or  consumption  levels  relative  to  previous  years  along  the  pathway. Aggregate  mitigation  costs  depend  strongly  on  the  modelling  framework  used  and  the  assumptions Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII about  the  reference  scenario  against  which  mitigation  costs  are  measured,  in  particular  whether  the reference scenario is, or not, on the efficiency frontier of the economy. If the economy is assumed to be  at  the  efficiency  frontier  in  the  reference  scenario,  mitigation  inevitably  leads  to  actual  costs,  at least  in  the  short  run  until  the  production  frontier  evolves  with  technical  and  structural  change. Starting  from  a  reference  scenario  that  is  not  on  the  efficiency  frontier  opens  the  possibility  to simultaneously  reduce  emissions  and  obtain  macroeconomic  gains,  depending  on  the  design  and implementation of mitigation policies. A number of factors can result in reference scenarios below the efficiency  frontier,  for  instance  distorting  labour  taxes  and/or  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  misallocation  or under-utilization of  production  factors  such  as  involuntary  unemployment, imperfect information  or non-rational  behaviours.  Although  these  factors  are  pervasive,  the  modelling  frameworks  used  to construct mitigation pathways are often limited in their ability to represent them (Köberle et al. 2021). The  absolute  level  of  economic  activity  and  welfare  also  strongly  depends  on  the  socioeconomic pathway  assumptions  regarding  inter  alia  evolutions  in  demography,  productivity,  education  levels, inequality and technical change and innovation. The GDP or consumption indicators reported in the database  of  scenarios,  and  synthesized  below,  represent  the  absolute  level  of  aggregate  economic activity or consumption but do not reflect welfare and well-being (Roberts et al. 2020), that notably depend on human needs satisfaction, distribution within society and inequality (see section 3.6.4). Chapter  1  and  Annex  III  give  further  elements  on  the  economic  concepts  and  on  the  modelling frameworks, including their limitations, used in this report, respectively. END BOX HERE Estimates for the marginal abatement cost of carbon in mitigation pathways vary widely, depending on  the  modelling  framework  used  and  socioeconomic,  technological  and  policy  assumptions. However,  it  is  robust  across  modelling  frameworks  that  the  marginal  abatement  cost  of  carbon increases for lower temperature categories, with a higher increase in the short-term than in the longer-term (Figure 3.32, left panel) (high confidence). The marginal abatement cost of carbon increases non-linearly with the decrease of CO2 emissions level, but the uncertainty in the range of estimates also increases  (Figure  3.33).  Mitigation  pathways  with  low‐energy  consumption  patterns  exhibit  lower carbon  values  (Méjean  et  al.  2019;  Meyer  et  al.  2021).  In  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic recovery, Kikstra et al. (2021a) also show that a low energy demand recovery scenario reduces carbon prices  for  a  1.5°C  consistent  pathway  by  19%  compared  to  a  scenario  with  energy  demand  trends restored to pre-pandemic levels. For  optimization  modelling  frameworks,  the  time  profile  of  marginal  abatement  costs  of  carbon depends  on  the  discount  rate,  with  lower  discount  rates  implying  higher  carbon  values  in  the  short term but lower values in the long term (Emmerling et al. 2019) (see also Discounting in glossary and Annex III part I section 2). In that case, the discount rate also influences the shape of the emissions trajectory, with low discount rates implying more emission reduction in the short-term and, for low temperature categories, limiting CDR and temperature overshoot. Pathways that correspond to NDCs in 2030 and strengthen action after 2030 imply higher marginal abatement costs of carbon in the longer run than pathways with stronger immediate global mitigation action (Figure 3.32, right panel) (high confidence). Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Figure 3.32: Marginal abatement cost of carbon in 2030, 2050 and 2100 for mitigation pathways with immediate global mitigation action (left panel), and ratio in 2050 between pathways that correspond to NDC in 2030 and strengthen action after 2030 and pathways with immediate global mitigation action, for C3 and C4 temperature categories (right panel). 1 Figure 3.33: Marginal abatement cost of carbon with respect to CO2 emissions for mitigation pathways with immediate global mitigation action, in 2030 (left panel) and 2050 (right panel). 6 Aggregate economic activity and consumption levels in mitigation pathways are primarily determined by socioeconomic development pathways but are also influenced by the stringency of the mitigation goal and the policy choices to reach the goal (high confidence). Mitigation pathways in temperature categories  C1  and  C2  entail  losses  in  global  consumption  with  respect  to  their  baselines  –  not including benefits of avoided climate change impacts nor co-benefits or co-harms of mitigation action –  that  correspond  to  an  annualized  reduction  of  consumption  growth  by  0.04  (median  value) (interquartile  range  [0.02-0.06])  percentage  points  over  the  century.  For  pathways  in  temperature categories  C3  and  C4  this  reduction  in  global  consumption  growth  is  0.03  (median  value) (interquartile  range  [0.01-0.05])  percentage  points  over  the  century.  In  the  majority  of  studies  that focus on the economic effects of mitigation without accounting for climate damages, global economic growth and consumption growth is reduced compared to baseline scenarios (that omit damages from climate change), but mitigation pathways do not represent an absolute decrease of economic activity level (Figure 3.34, panels b and c). Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII However, the possibility for increased economic activity following mitigation action, and conversely the  risk  of  large  negative  economic  effects,  are  not  excluded.  Some  studies  find  that  mitigation increases  the  speed  of economic  growth  compared to  baseline scenarios  (Pollitt  and  Mercure  2018; Mercure  et  al.  2019).  These  studies  are  based  on  a  macroeconomic  modelling  framework  that represent  baselines  below  the  efficiency  frontier,  based  on  non-equilibrium  economic  theory,  and assume  that  mitigation  is  undertaken  in  such  a  way  that  green  investments  do  not  crowd-out investment in other parts of the economy – and therefore offers an economic stimulus. In the context of the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, it is estimated that a green investment push, would initially boost the economy while also reducing GHG emissions (IMF 2020; Pollitt et al. 2021). Conversely, several  studies  find  that  only  a  GDP  non-growth/degrowth  or  post-growth  approach  allow  to  reach climate stabilization below 2°C (Hardt and O’Neill 2017; D’Alessandro et al. 2020; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Nieto et al. 2020), or to minimize the risks of reliance on high energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale  CDR  and  large-scale  renewable  energy  deployment  (Keyßer  and  Lenzen  2021).  Similarly, feedbacks of financial system risk to amplify shocks induced by mitigation policy and lead to higher impact on economic activity (Stolbova et al. 2018). Mitigation cost  increases with the stringency of mitigation (Figure  3.34, panels b and c) (Hof et al. 2017;  Vrontisi  et  al.  2018),  but  are  reduced  when  energy  demand  is  moderated  through  energy efficiency and lifestyle changes (Fujimori et al. 2014; Bibas et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2018; Méjean et al. 2019),  when  sustainable  transport  policies  are  implemented  (Zhang  et  al.  2018c),  and  when international  technology  cooperation  is  fostered  (Schultes  et  al.  2018;  Paroussos  et  al.  2019). Mitigation costs also depend on assumptions on availability and costs of technologies (Clarke et al. 2014; Bosetti et al. 2015; Dessens et al. 2016; Creutzig et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019; Giannousakis et al.  2021),  on  the  representation  of  innovation  dynamics  in  modelling  frameworks  (Hoekstra  et  al. 2017; Rengs et al. 2020) (see also chapter 16), as well as the representation of investment dynamics and financing mechanisms (Iyer et al. 2015c; Mercure et al. 2019; Battiston et al. 2021). In particular, endogenous and induced innovation reduce technology cost over time, create path-dependencies and reduce the macroeconomic cost of reaching a mitigation target (see also 1.7.1.2). Mitigation costs also depend on the socioeconomic assumptions (van Vuuren et al. 2020; Hof et al. 2017).  Page 95
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Figure 3.34: Panel (a): Mean annual global consumption growth rate over 2020-2100 for the mitigation pathways in the AR6 scenarios database. Panel (b): Global GDP loss compared to baselines (not accounting for climate change damages) in 2030, 2050 and 2100 for mitigation pathways with immediate global action. Panel (c): Total discounted consumption loss (with a 3% discount rate) in mitigation scenarios with respect to their corresponding baseline (not accounting for climate change damages) as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions until date of net zero CO2. Panel (d): Comparison of GDP losses compared to baselines (not accounting for climate change damages) in 2030, 2050 and 2100 for pairs of scenarios depicting immediate action pathways and delayed action pathways. Mitigation pathways with early emissions reductions represent higher mitigation costs in the short run but  bring  long-term  gains  for  the  economycompared  to  delayed  transition  pathways  (high confidence).  Pathways  with  earlier  mitigation  action  bring  higher  long-term  GDP  than  pathways reaching  the  same  end-of-century  temperature  with  weaker  early  action  (Figure  3.34,  panel  d). Comparing  counterfactual  history  scenarios,  Sanderson  and  O’Neill  (2020)  also  find  that  delayed mitigation action leads to higher peak costs.  Rogelj et al. (2019b) and Riahi et al. (2021) also show that pathways with earlier timing of net zero CO2 lead to higher transition costs but lower long term mitigation  costs,  due  to  dynamic  effects  arising  from  lock-in  avoidance  and  learning  effects.  For example,  Riahi  et  al  (2021)  find  that  for  a  2˚C  target,  the  GDP  losses  (compared  to  a  reference scenario without impacts from climate change) in 2100 are 5-70% lower in pathways that avoid net negative CO2 emissions and temperature overshoot than in pathways with overshoot. Accounting also for climate  change  damage,  van  der Wijst  et  al.  (2021a)  show  that avoiding  net  negative  emissions leads to a small increase in total discounted mitigation costs over 2020-2100, between 5% and 14% in their medium assumptions, but does not increase mitigation costs when damages are high and when using a  low  discount rate, and  becomes  economically  attractive if  damages are not  fully  reversible. The modelled cost-optimal balance of mitigation action over time strongly depends on the discount rate used to compute or evaluate mitigation pathways: lower discount rates favour earlier mitigation, Page 96
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII reducing both temperature overshoot and reliance on net negative carbon emissions (Emmerling et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). Mitigation pathways with weak early action corresponding to NDCs in 2030 and  strengthening  action  after  2030  to  reach  end-of-century  temperature  targets  imply  limited mitigation costs in 2030, compared to immediate global action pathways, but faster increase in costs post-2030, with implications for intergenerational equity (Aldy et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016; Vrontisi et al.  2018).  Emissions  trading  policies  reduce  global  aggregate  mitigation  costs,  in  particular  in  the context of achieving NDCs (Fujimori et al. 2015, 2016a; Edmonds et al. 2021; Böhringer et al. 2021), and change the distribution of mitigation costs between regions and countries (see section 3.6.1.2).  Regional mitigation costs and effort-sharing regimes 3.6.1.2The economic repercussions of mitigation policies vary across countries (Hof et al. 2017; Aldy et al. 2016):  regional  variations  exist  in  institutions,  economic  and  technological  development,  and mitigation opportunities. For a globally uniform carbon price, carbon intensive and energy exporting countries bear the highest economic costs because of a deeper transformation of their economies and of trade losses in the fossil markets (Stern et al. 2012; Tavoni et al. 2015; Böhringer et al. 2021). This finding is confirmed in  Figure  3.35.  Since  carbon  intensive  countries  are  often  poorer,  uniform  global  carbon  prices  raises equity concerns (Tavoni et al. 2015). On the other hand, the climate economic benefits of mitigating climate change will be larger in poorer countries (Cross-Working Group Box 1). This reduces policy regressivity  but  does  not  eliminate  it  (Taconet  et  al.  2020;  Gazzotti  et  al.  2021).  Together  with  co-benefits, such as health benefits of improved air quality, the economic benefits of mitigating climate change are likely to outweigh mitigation costs in many regions (Li et al. 2018, 2019; Scovronick et al. 2021). Regional  policy  costs  depend  on  the  evaluation  framework  (Budolfson  et  al.  2021),  policy  design, including  revenue  recycling,  and  on international  coordination,  especially  among  trade  partners.  By fostering technological change and finance, climate cooperation can generate economic benefits, both in  large  developing  economies  such  as  China  and  India  (Paroussos  et  al.  2019)  and  industrialized countries such as Europe (Vrontisi et al. 2020). International coordination is a major driver of regional policy costs. Delayed participation in global mitigation efforts raises participation costs, especially in carbon intensive economies ( Figure 3.35, right panel). Trading systems and transfers can deliver cost savings and improve equity (Rose et al. 2017a). On the other hand, measures that reduce imports of energy intensive goods such as  carbon  border  tax  adjustment  may  imply  costs  outside  of  the  policy  jurisdiction  and  have international equity repercussions, depending on how they are designed (Böhringer et al. 2012, 2017; Cosbey et al. 2019) (see also 13.6.6). An  equitable  global  emission  trading  scheme  would  require  very  large  international  financial transfers, in the order of several hundred billion USD per year (Tavoni et al. 2015; van den Berg et al. 2020; Bauer et al. 2020). The magnitude of transfers depends on the stringency of the climate  goals and  on  the  burden  sharing  principle.  Equitable  burden  sharing  compliant  with  the  Paris  Agreement leads to negative carbon allowances for developed countries as well as China by mid-century (van den Berg et al. 2020), more stringent than cost-optimal pathways. International transfers also  depend on the  underlying  socio-economic  development  (Leimbach  and  Giannousakis  2019),  as  these  drive  the mitigation costs of meeting the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018b). By contrast, achieving equity without  international  markets  would  result in  a large  discrepancy in  regional  carbon  prices,  up to  a factor (Bauer et al. 2020). The efficiency-sovereignty trade-off can be partly resolved by allowing for limited  differentiation  of  regional  carbon  prices:  moderate  financial  transfers  substantially  reduce inefficiencies by narrowing the carbon price spread (Bauer et al. 2020).

Right panel: Policy costs in 2050 (as in panel a) for 1.5-2°C climate categories for scenario pairs that represent either immediate global action (‘immediate’) or delayed global action (‘delayed’) with weaker action in the short-term, strengthening to reach the same end-of-century temperature target. Investments in mitigation pathways 3.6.1.3Figure  3.36  and  Figure  3.37  show  increased  investment  needs  in  the  energy  sector  in  lower temperature  categories,  and  a  major  shift  away  from  fossil  generation  and  extraction  towards electricity,  including  for  system  enhancements  for  electricity  transmission,  distribution  and  storage, and low-carbon technologies. Investment needs in the electricity sector are USD2.3 trillion 2015 yr-1 over  2023-2050  on average  for  C1  pathways,  USD2.0  trillion for  C2 pathways,  USD1.7  trillion  for C3, USD1.2 trillion for C4 and USD0.9-1.1 billion for C5/C6/C7 (mean values for pathways in each temperature categories). The regional pattern of power sector investments broadly mirrors the global picture.  However,  the  bulk  of  investment  requirements  are  in  medium-  and  low-income  regions. These  results  from  the  AR6  scenarios  database  corroborate  the  findings  from  McCollum  et  al. (2018a), Zhou et al. (2019) and Bertram et al. (2021). In  the  context  of the  COVID-19  pandemic recovery,  (Kikstra  et  al.  2021a)  show  that  a  low  energy demand  recovery  scenario  reduces  energy  investments  required  until  2030  for  a  1.5°C  consistent pathway  by  9%  (corresponding  to  reducing  total  required  energy  investment  by  USD1.8  trillion) compared to a scenario with energy demand trends restored to pre-pandemic levels.

Few studies extend the scope of the investment needs quantification beyond the energy sector. Fisch-Romito  and  Guivarch  (2019)  and  Ó  Broin  and  Guivarch  (2017)  assess  investment  needs  for transportation  infrastructures  and  find  lower  investment  needs  in  low-carbon  pathways,  due  to  a reduction  in  transport  activity  and  a  shift  towards  less  road  construction,  compared  to  high-carbon pathways.  Rozenberg  and Fay  (2019)  estimate  the  funding  needs to  close  the  service  gaps in  water and  sanitation,  transportation,  electricity,  irrigation,  and  flood  protection  in  thousands  of  scenarios, showing that infrastructure investment paths compatible with full decarbonization in the second half of  the  century  need  not  cost  more  than  more-polluting  alternatives.  Investment  needs  are  estimated between 2 percent and 8 percent of GDP, depending on the quality and quantity of services targeted, the timing of investments, construction costs, and complementary policies.

This  box  summarizes  elements  from  the  WGII  report  on  aggregate  climate  change impacts  and  risks,  putting  them  into  the  context  of  mitigation  pathways.  AR6  Working  Group  II provides  an  assessment  of  current  lines  of  evidence  regarding  potential  climate  risks  with  future climate  change,  and  therefore,  the  avoided  risks  from  mitigating  climate  change.  Regional  and sectoral climate risks to physical and social systems are assessed (WGII Chapters 2-15). Over 100 of these  are  identified  as  Key  Risks  (KRs)  and  further  synthesized  by  WGII  Chapter  16  into  eight overarching  Representative  Key  Risks  (RKRs)  relating  to  low-lying  coastal  systems;  terrestrial  and ocean  ecosystems;  critical  physical  infrastructure,  networks  and  services;  living  standards;  human health;  food  security;  water  security;  and  peace  and  mobility  (WGII  16.5.2).  The  RKR  assessment finds that risks increase with global warming level, and also depend on socioeconomic development conditions,  which  shape  exposure  and  vulnerability,  and  adaptation  opportunities  and  responses. “Reasons For Concern”, another WGII aggregate climate impacts risk framing, are also assessed to increase with climate change, with increasing risk for unique and threatened systems, extreme weather events,  distribution  of  impacts,  global  aggregate  impacts,  and  large-scale  singular  events  (WGII Chapter  16).  For  human  systems,  in  general,  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  are  found  to  have  greater exposure level and vulnerability for a given hazard. With some increase in global average warming Page 100
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII from today expected regardless of mitigation efforts, human and natural systems will be exposed to new conditions and additional adaptation will be needed  (WGII Chapter 18). The range of dates for when a specific warming level could be reached depends on future global emissions, with significant overlap  of  ranges  across  emissions  scenarios  due  to  climate  system  response  uncertainties  (WGI Tables  4.2  and  4.5).  The  speed  at  which  the  climate  changes  is  relevant  to  adaptation  timing, possibilities, and net impacts. WGII  also  assesses  the  growing  literature  estimating  the  global  aggregate  economic  impacts  of climate change and the social cost of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (Cross-Working Box Economic:  Estimating  Global  Economic  Impacts  from  Climate  Change  and  the  Social  Cost  of Carbon”, in WGII Chapter 16). The former represents aggregate estimates that inform assessment of the  economic  benefits  of  mitigation.  This  literature  is  characterized  by  significant  variation  in  the estimates, including for today's level of global warming, due primarily to fundamental differences in methods,  but  also  differences  in  impacts  included,  representation  of  socioeconomic  exposure, consideration  of  adaptation,  aggregation  approach,  and  assumed  persistence  of  damages.  WGII’s assessment  identifies  different  approaches  to  quantification  of  aggregated  economic  impacts  of climate change, including: physical modelling of impact processes, such as projected mortality rates from  climate  risks  such  as  heat,  vector-  or  waterborne  diseases  that  are  then  monetized;  structural economic modelling  of  impacts  on  production, consumption,  and markets for  economic  sectors  and regional  economies;  and  statistical  estimation  of  impacts  based  on  observed  historical  responses  to weather and climate. WGII finds that variation in estimated global economic impacts increases with warming  in  all  methodologies,  indicating  higher  risk  in  terms  of  economic  impacts  at  higher temperatures  (high  confidence).  Many  estimates  are  nonlinear  with  marginal  economic  impacts increasing  with  temperature,  although  some  show  declining  marginal  economic  impacts  with temperature, and functional forms cannot be determined for all studies. WGII’s assessment finds that the lack of comparability between methodologies does not allow for identification of robust ranges of global  economic  impact  estimates  (high  confidence).  Further,  WGII  identifies  evaluating  and reconciling differences in methodologies as a research priority for facilitating use of the different lines of evidence (high confidence). However, there are estimates that are higher than AR5, indicating that global aggregate economic impacts could be higher than previously estimated (low confidence due to the lack of comparability across methodologies and lack of robustness of estimates) (Cross-Working Box Economic). Conceptually, the difference in aggregate economic impacts from climate change between two given temperature  levels  represents  the  aggregate  economic  benefits  arising  from  avoided  climate  change impacts due to mitigation action. A subset of the studies whose estimates were evaluated by WGII (5 of  15) are  used to  derive illustrative  estimates  of aggregate  economic  benefits in  2100  arising  from avoided climate change (Howard and Sterner 2017; Burke et al. 2018; Pretis et al. 2018; Kahn et al. 2019;  Takakura  et  al.  2019).  Burke  et  al.  (2018),  Pretis  et  al.  (2018)  and  Kahn  et  al.  (2019)  are examples  of  statistical  estimation  of  historical  relationships  between  temperature  and  economic growth,  whereas  Takakura  et  al.  (2019)  is  an  example  of  structural  modelling,  which  evaluates selected  impact  channels  (impacts  on  agriculture  productivity,  undernourishment,  heat-related mortality,  labour  productivity,  cooling/heating  demand,  hydroelectric  and  thermal  power  generation capacity  and  fluvial  flooding)  with  a  general  equilibrium  model.  Howard  and  Sterner  (2017)  and  Rose et al. (2017b) estimate damage functions that can be used to compute the economic benefits of mitigation  from  avoiding  a  given  temperature  level  for  a  lower  one.  Howard  and  Sterner  (2017)  estimate a damage function from a meta-analysis of aggregate economic impact studies, while Rose et al. (2017b) derive global functions by temperature and socioeconomic drivers from stylized aggregate Cost-Benefit-Analysis  integrated  assessment  models  using  diagnostic  experiments.  Cross-Working Group Box 1 Figure 1 summarizes the global aggregate economic benefits in 2100 of avoided climate Page 101
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII change impacts from individual studies corresponding to shifting from a higher temperature category (above  3°C,  below 3°C  or below 2.5°C) to  below  2°C,  as  well as from  below 2°C  to  below 1.5°C. Benefits  are  positive  and  increase  with  the  temperature  gap  for  any  given  study,  and  this  result  is robust  across  socioeconomic  scenarios.  The  Figure  provides  evidence  of  a  wide  range  of quantifications,  and  illustrates  the  important  differences  associated  with  methods.  Panel  a  puts  the studies used to calculate aggregate economic benefits arising from avoided impacts into the context of the  broader  set  of  studies  assessed  in  WGII  (WGII  Cross-Working  Group  Box  Economic,  16.6.2). However, economic benefits in 2100 arising from avoided impacts cannot be directly computed from damage estimates across this broader set of studies, due to inconsistencies  - different socioeconomic assumptions,  scenario  designs,  and  counterfactual  reference  scenarios  across  studies.  Furthermore, these  types  of  estimates  cannot  be  readily  compared  to  mitigation  cost  estimates.  The  comparison would  require  a  framework  that  ensures  consistency  in  assumptions  and  dynamics  and  allows  for consideration of benefits and costs along the entire pathway.  Cross-Working Group Box 1 Figure 1: Global aggregate economic benefits of mitigation from avoided climate change impacts in 2100 corresponding to shifting from a higher temperature category (4°C (3.75°C-4.25°C), 3°C(2.75°C-3.25°C) or above 2°C (2°C-2.5°C)) to below 2°C (1.5°C-2°C), as well as from below 2°C to below 1.5°C (1°C-1.5°C), from the five studies discussed in the text. Panel a is adapted from WGII CWGB ECONOMIC Figure 1, showing global aggregate economic impact estimates (% global GDP loss relative to GDP without additional climate change) by temperature change level. All estimates are shown in grey. Estimates used for the computation of estimated benefits in 2100 in Panel b are coloured for the selected studies, which provide results for different temperature change levels.  See the WGII Chapter 16 box for discussion and assessment of the estimates in Panel a and the differences in methodologies. For B18 and T19, median estimates in the cluster are considered.  Shape distinguishes the baseline scenarios. Temperature ranges are highlighted. HS17 estimates are based on their preferred model - 50th percentile of non-catastrophic damage. Panel b shows the implied aggregate economic benefits in 2100 of a lower temperature increase. Economic benefits for point estimates are computed as a difference, while economic benefits from the curve HS17 are computed as ranges from the segment differences. Aggregate benefits from avoided impacts expressed in GDP terms, as in Figure 1, do not encompass all avoided climate risks, adaptation possibilities, and does not represent their influence on well-being and welfare (WGII Cross-Working Group Box Economic). Methodological challenges for economic impact  estimates  include  representing  uncertainty  and  variability,  capturing  interactions  and  spill overs,  considering  distributional  effects,  representing  micro  and  macro  adaptation  processes, specifying non-gradual damages and non-linearities, and improving understanding of potential long-run growth effects. In addition, the economic benefits aggregated at the global scale provide limited insights  into  regional  heterogeneity.  Global  economic  impact  studies  with  regional  estimates  find large  differences  across  regions  in  absolute  and  percentage  terms,  with  developing  and  transitional economies  typically  more  vulnerable.  Furthermore,  (avoided)  impacts  for  poorer  households  and poorer countries can represent a smaller share in aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP terms or monetary  terms,  compared  to  their  influence  on  well-being  and  welfare  (Hallegatte  et  al.  2020; Markhvida  et  al.  2020).  Finally,  as noted  by WGII,  other  lines of  evidence regarding  climate  risks, beyond  monetary  estimates,  should  be  considered  in  decision-making,  including  key  risks  and Reasons for Concern. Page 102
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Group Box 1). CBA integrated assessment models raised critics, in particular for omitting elements of dynamic realism, such as inertia, induced innovation and path dependence, in their representation of mitigation (Grubb et al. 2021), and for underestimating damages from climate change, missing non-monetary  damages, the  uncertain  and  heterogeneous nature  of  damages  and the  risk of  catastrophic damages (Stern 2013, 2016; Stern and Stiglitz 2021; Diaz and Moore 2017; Pindyck 2017; NASEM 2017;  Stoerk  et  al.  2018). Emerging  literature has started  to  address those  gaps,  and integrated into cost-benefit frameworks the account of heterogeneity of climate damage and inequality (Dennig et al. 2015;  Budolfson  et  al.  2017;  Fleurbaey  et  al.  2019;  Kornek  et  al.  2021),  damages  with  higher persistence, including damages on capital and growth (Dietz and Stern 2015; Moore and Diaz 2015; Moyer et al. 2014; Guivarch and Pottier 2018; Piontek et al. 2019; Ricke et al. 2018), risks of tipping points (Cai et al. 2015, 2016; Lontzek et al. 2015; Lemoine and Traeger 2016; van der Ploeg and de Zeeuw 2018; Cai and Lontzek 2019; Nordhaus 2019; Yumashev et al. 2019; Taconet et al. 2021) and damages  to  natural  capital  and  non-market  goods  (Tol  1994;  Sterner  and  Persson  2008;  Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020; Drupp and Hänsel 2021). Each of these factors, when accounted for in a CBA framework, tends to increase the welfare benefit of mitigation, thus leading to stabilization at lower temperature in optimal mitigation pathways. The limitations  in  CBA  modelling  frameworks  remain  significant,  their  ability  to  represent  all  damages incomplete,  and  the  uncertainty  in  estimates  remains  large.  However,  emerging  evidence  suggests that,  even  without  accounting  for  co-benefits  of  mitigation  on  other  sustainable  development dimensions (see section 3.6.3 for elements on co-benefits), global benefits of pathways likely to limit warming to 2°C outweigh global mitigation costs over the 21st century: depending on the study, the reason for this result lies in assumptions of economic damages from climate change in the higher end of  available  estimates  (Moore  and  Diaz  2015;  Ueckerdt  et  al.  2019;  Brown  and  Saunders  2020; Glanemann et al. 2020), in the introduction of risks of tipping-points (Cai and Lontzek 2019), in the consideration of damages to natural capital and non-market goods (Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020) or  in  the  combination  of  updated  representations  of  carbon  cycle  and  climate  modules,  updated damage  estimates  and/or  updated  representations  of  economic  and  mitigation  dynamics  (Dietz  and Stern 2015; Hänsel et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020; van der Wijst et al. 2021b). In the above studies that perform  a  sensitivity  analysis,  this  result  is  found  to  be  robust  to  a  wide  range  of  assumptions  on social  preferences  (in  particular  on  inequality  aversion  and  pure  rate  of  time  preference)  and  holds except  if  assumptions  of  economic  damages  from  climate  change  are  in  the  lower  end  of  available estimates  and  the  pure  rate  of  time  preference  is  in  the  higher  range  of  values  usually  considered (typically above 1.5%).However, although such pathways bring net benefits over time (in terms of aggregate  discounted  present  value),  they  involve  distributional  consequences  and  transition  costs (Brown and Saunders 2020; Brown et al. 2020) (see also sections 3.6.1.2 and 3.6.4).  The standard discounted utilitarian framework dominates CBA, thus often limiting the analysis to the question of discounting. CBA can be expanded to accommodate a wider variety of ethical values to assess mitigation pathways (Fleurbaey et al. 2019). The role of ethical values with regard to inequality and the situation of the worse-off (Adler et al. 2017), risk (van den Bergh and Botzen 2014; Drouet et al. 2015), and population size (Scovronick et al. 2017; Méjean et al. 2020) has been explored. In most of these studies, the optimal climate policy is found to be more stringent than the one obtained using a standard discounted utilitarian criterion. Page 103

In cost effectiveness studies too, incorporating benefits from avoided climate damages influences the results and leads to more stringent mitigation in the short-term (Drouet et al. 2021; Schultes et al. 2021). 3.6.3Aggregate economic implication of mitigation co-benefits and trade-offs Mitigation  actions  have  co-benefits  and  trade-offs  with  other  sustainable  development  dimensions (section  3.7), beyond  climate change,  which  imply welfare  effects  and  economic  effects,  as  well  as other  implications  beyond  the  economic  dimension.  The  majority  of  quantifications  of  mitigation costs and benefits synthesized in sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2 do not account for these economic benefits and costs associated with co-benefits and trade-offs along mitigation pathways. Systematic reviews of the literature on co-benefits and trade-offs from mitigation actions have shown that only a small portion of articles provide economic quantifications (Deng et al. 2017; Karlsson et al.  2020).  Most  economic  quantifications  use  monetary  valuation  approaches.  Improved  air  quality, and associated health effects, are the co-benefit category dominating the literature (Markandya et al. 2018; Vandyck et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019; Howard et al. 2020; Karlsson et al. 2020b; Rauner et  al.  2020a,b),  but  some  studies  cover  other  categories,  including  health  effects  from  diet  change (Springmann  et  al.  2016b)  and  biodiversity  impacts  (Rauner  et  al.  2020a).  Regarding  health  effects from air quality improvement and from diet change, co-benefits are shown to be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation  costs  (Thompson et  al.  2014;  Springmann et  al.  2016a,b; Markandya et  al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b; Howard et al. 2020; Rauner et al. 2020a,b; Liu et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021). Co-benefits from improved air quality are concentrated sooner in time than economic benefits from  avoided  climate  change  impacts  (Karlsson  et  al.  2020),  such  that  when  accounting  both  for positive health impacts from reduced air pollution and for negative climate effect of reduced cooling aerosols, optimal greenhouse gas mitigation pathways exhibit immediate and continual net economic benefits  (Scovronick  et  al.  2019a).  However,  WGI  chapter  6  (section  6.7.3)  shows  a  delay  in  air pollution reduction benefits when they come from climate change mitigation policies compared with air pollution reduction policies. Achieving  co-benefits  is  not  automatic  but  results  from  coordinated  policies  and  implementation strategies (Clarke et al. 2014; McCollum et al. 2018a). Similarly, avoiding trade-offs requires targeted policies (van Vuuren et al. 2015; Bertram et al. 2018). There is limited evidence of such pathways, but the  evidence  shows  that  pathways  mitigation  pathways  designed  to  reach  multiple  sustainable development  goals  instead  of  focusing  exclusively  on  emissions  reductions,  result  in  limited additional  costs  compared  to  the  increased  benefits  (Cameron  et  al.  2016;  McCollum  et  al.  2018b; Fujimori et al. 2020a; Sognnaes et al. 2021). 3.6.4Structural change, employment and distributional issues along mitigation pathways Page 104
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII mitigation  actions  themselves  and  the  climate  change  impacts  avoided  along  mitigation  pathways, effects on structural change, including employment, and distributional effects. 3.6.4.1 Economic structural change and employment in long-term mitigation pathways Mitigation  pathways  entail  transformation  of  the  energy  sector,  with  structural  change  away  from fossil  energy  and  towards  low-carbon  energy  (section  3.3),  as  well  as  broader  economic  structural change,  including  industrial  restructuring  and  reductions  in  carbon-intensive  activities  in  parallel  to extensions in low-carbon activities. impacts  of  mitigation  pathways  mainly  depend  on Mitigation  affects  work  through  multiple  channels,  which  impacts  geographies,  sectors  and  skill categories  differently  (Fankhaeser  et  al.  2008;  Bowen  et  al.  2018;  Malerba  and  Wiebe  2021). the  aggregate Aggregate  employment macroeconomic  effect  of  mitigation  (see  3.6.1,  3.6.2)  and  of  mitigation  policy  design  and implementation  (Freire-González  2018)  (section  4.2.6.3).  Most  studies  that  quantify  overall employment  implications  of  mitigation  policies  are  conducted  at  the  national  or  regional  scales (section 4.2.6.3), or sectoral scales (e.g., see chapter 6 for energy sector jobs). The evidence is limited at  the  multi-national  or  global  scale,  but  studies  generally  find  small  differences  in  aggregate employment in mitigation pathways compared to baselines: the sign of the difference depends on the assumptions and modelling frameworks used and the policy design tested, with some studies or policy design cases leading to small increases in employment (Chateau and Saint-Martin 2013; Pollitt et al. 2015;  Barker  et  al.  2016;  Garcia-Casals  et  al.  2019;  Fujimori  et  al.  2020a;  Vrontisi  et  al.  2020; Malerba  and  Wiebe  2021)  and  other  studies  or  policy  design  cases  leading  to  small  decreases (Chateau and Saint-Martin 2013; Vandyck et al. 2016). The small variations in aggregate employment hide  substantial  reallocation  of  jobs  across  sectors,  with  jobs  creation  in  some  sectors  and  jobs destruction  in  others.  Mitigation  action  through  thermal  renovation  of  buildings,  installation  and maintenance of low-carbon generation, the build-out of public transit lead to jobs creation, while jobs are lost in  fossil fuel  extraction,  energy  supply and energy intensive  sectors in mitigation pathways (von Stechow et al. 2015, 2016; Barker et al. 2016; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Perrier and Quirion 2018; Pollitt and Mercure 2018; Dominish et al. 2019; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019). In the energy sector, jobs losses in the fossil fuel sector are found to be compensated by gains in wind and solar jobs, leading to a net increase in energy sector jobs in 2050 in a mitigation pathway compatible with stabilization of the temperature increase below 2°C (Pai et al. 2021). Employment effects also differ by geographies, with  energy-importing  regions  benefiting  from  net  job  creations  but  energy-exporting  regions experiencing  very  small  gains  or  suffering  from  net  job  destruction  (Barker  et  al.  2016;  Pollitt  and Mercure  2018;  Garcia-Casals  et  al.  2019;  Malerba  and  Wiebe  2021).  Coal  phase-out  raises  acute issues  of  just  transition  for  the  coal-dependent  countries  (Spencer  et  al.  2018;  Jakob  et  al.  2020) (section 4.5 and Box 6.2). Mitigation  action  also  affects  employment  through  avoided  climate  change  impacts.  Mitigation reduces the risks to human health and associated impacts on labour and helps protect workers from the occupational health and safety hazards imposed by climate change (Kjellstrom et al. 2016, 2018, 2019 ; Levi et al. 2018; Day et al. 2019) (see WGII chapter 16).  Page 105
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII a just transition). For instance, emissions taxation has important distributive effects, both between and within  income  groups  (Klenert  et  al.  2018;  Cronin  et  al.  2018b;  Pizer  and  Sexton  2019;  Douenne 2020; Steckel et al. 2021). These effects are more significant in some sectors, such as transport, and depend on country-specific consumption structures (Dorband et al. 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019; Ohlendorf et al. 2021). However, revenues from emissions taxation can be used to lessen their regressive distributional impacts or even turn the policy into a progressive policy reducing inequality and/or leading to gains for lower income households (Cameron et al. 2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Fremstad and Paul 2019; Fujimori et al. 2020b; Böhringer et al. 2021; Steckel et al. 2021; Soergel et al. 2021b; Budolfson et al. 2021). Mitigation policies may affect the poorest through effects on energy and food  prices  (Hasegawa  et al.  2015;  Fujimori  et al. 2019). Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi  (2019) and  Lamb  et  al.  (2020)  synthesize  evidence  from  the  existing  literature  on  social  co-impacts  of climate change mitigation policy and their implications for inequality. They show that most policies can  compound  or  lessen  inequalities  depending  on  contextual  factors,  policy  design  and  policy implementation,  but  that  negative  inequality  impacts  of  climate  policies  can  be  mitigated  (and possibly even prevented), when distributive and procedural justice are taken into consideration in all stages  of  policy  making,  including  policy  planning,  development  and  implementation,  and  when focusing  on  the  carbon  intensity  of  lifestyles,  sufficiency  and  equity,  wellbeing  and  decent  living standards for all (see also 13.6). Mitigation  pathways  also  affect  economic  inequalities  between  and  within  countries,  and  poverty, through  the  reduction  of  climate  change  impacts  that  fall  more  heavily  on  low-income  countries, communities  and  households  and  exacerbate  poverty  (WGII  chapters  8  and  16).  Higher  levels  of warming are projected to generate higher inequality between countries as well as within them (WGII chapter  16).  Through  avoiding  impacts,  mitigation  thus  reduces  economic  inequalities  and  poverty (high confidence).  A  few  studies  consider  both  mitigation  policies  distributional  impacts  and  avoided  climate  change impacts on inequalities along mitigation pathways.  Rezai et al. (2018) find that unmitigated climate change  impacts  increase  inequality,  whereas  mitigation  has  the  potential  to  reverse  this  effect. Considering  uncertainty  in  socioeconomic  assumptions,  emission  pathways,  mitigation  costs, temperature  response,  and  climate  damage,  Taconet  et  al.  (2020)  show  that  the  uncertainties associated  with  socioeconomic  assumptions  and  damage  estimates  are  the  main  drivers  of  future inequalities  between  countries  and  that  in  most  cases  mitigation  policies  reduce  future  inequalities between countries. Gazzotti et al. (2021) show that inequality persists in 2°C consistent pathways due to  regressivity  of  residual  climate  damages.  However,  the  evidence  on  mitigation  pathways implications  for  global inequality and  poverty  remains  limited,  and  the  modelling  frameworks  used have limited ability to fully represent the different dimensions of inequality and poverty and all the mechanisms  by  which  mitigation  affects  inequality  and  poverty  (Rao  et  al.  2017a;  Emmerling  and Tavoni 2021; Jafino et al. 2021).

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII demand enables synergies between mitigation and sustainability, with lower reliance on CDR  (high confidence). This  section covers the long-term  interconnection  of SD  and  mitigation,  taking forward  the  holistic vision  of  SD  described  in  the  SDGs  (Brandi  2015;  Leal  Filho  et  al.  2018).  Recent  studies  have explored  the  aggregated  impact  of  mitigation  for  multiple  sustainable  development  dimensions (Hasegawa et al. 2014; Bertram et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; McCollum et al. 2018b; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a). For instance, Figure 3.38 shows selected mitigation  co-benefits  and  trade-offs  based  on  a  subset  of  models  and  scenarios,  since  so  far  many IAMs do not have a comprehensive coverage of sustainable development goals (Rao et al. 2017a; van Soest et al. 2019). Figure 3.38 shows that mitigation likely leads to increased forest cover (SDG 15) and  reduced  mortality  from  ambient  PM2.5  pollution  (SDG  3)  compared  to  reference  scenarios. However, mitigation policies can also cause higher food prices and an increased population at risk of hunger (SDG 2) and relying on solid fuels (SDG 3 and SDG 7) as side effects. These trade-offs can be compensated through targeted support measures and/or additional SD policies (Cameron et al. 2016; Bertram et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a). Figure 3.38: Effect of climate change mitigation on different dimensions of sustainable development: shown are mitigation scenarios compatible with 1.5oC target (blue) and reference scenarios (red). Blue boxplots contain scenarios that include narrow mitigation policies from different studies (see below). This is compared to a sustainable development scenario (SP, Soergel et al. (2021a), cyan diamonds) integrating mitigation and SD policies (e.g., zero hunger in 2050 by assumption). Scenario sources for boxplots: single scenarios from i) Fujimori et al. (2020a); ii) Soergel et al. (2021a); multi-model scenario set from CD-LINKS (McCollum et al. 2018b; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Fujimori et al. 2019). For associated methods, see also Cameron et al. (2016), Rafaj et al. (2021). The reference scenario for (Fujimori et al. 2020a) is no-policy baseline; for all other studies, it includes current climate policies. In the “Food prices” and “Risk of hunger” panels, scenarios from CD-LINKS include a price cap of 200 USD/tCO2eq for land-use emissions (Fujimori et al. 2019). For the other indicators, CD-LINKS scenarios without price cap Roelfsema et al. (2020) are used due to SDG indicator availability. In the “Premature deaths” panel, a well-below 2oC scenario from Fujimori et al. (2020a) is used in place of a 1.5oC scenario due to data availability, and all scenarios are indexed to their 2015 values due to a spread in reported levels between models.

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII The  synthesis  of  the interplay  between climate mitigation and  sustainable  development  is  shown in Figure 3.39.  The left panel shows the reduction in population affected by climate impacts at 1.5°C compared to 3°C according to sustainability domains (Byers et al. 2018). Reducing warming reduces the  population  impacted  by  all  impact  categories  shown  (high  confidence).  The  left  panel  does  not take into account any side effects of mitigation efforts or policies to reduce warming: only reductions in climate impacts. This underscores that mitigation is an integral basis for comprehensive SD (Watts et al. 2015). The middle and right panels of Figure 3.39 show the effects of 1.5°C mitigation policies compared to current  national  policies:  narrow  mitigation  policies  (averaged  over  several  models,  middle  panel), and  policies  integrating  sustainability  considerations  (right  panel  of  Figure  3.39,  based  on  the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway “Shifting Pathways” (SP) (Soergel et al. 2021a)). Policies integrating sustainability  and  mitigation  (right  panel)  have  far  fewer  trade-offs  (red  bars)  and  more  co-benefits (green bars) than narrow mitigation policies (middle panel). Note that neither middle nor right panels include climate impacts. Areas of co-benefits include human health, ambient air pollution and other specific kinds of pollution, while areas of trade-off include food access, habitat loss and mineral resources (medium confidence). For  example,  action  consistent  with  1.5°C  in  the  absence  of  energy  demand  reduction  measures require large quantities of CDR, which, depending on the type used, are likely to negatively impact both food availability and areas for biodiversity (Fujimori et al. 2018; Ohashi et al. 2019; Roelfsema et al. 2020).  Mitigation to 1.5°C reduces climate impacts on sustainability (left). Policies integrating sustainability  and mitigation (right) have far fewer trade-offs than narrow mitigation policies (middle). 3-99  Total pages: 156Page 108

Mitigation  policies  which  target  direct  sector-level  regulation,  early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes have beneficial sustainable development outcomes across air pollution, food, energy and water (Bertram et al. 2018).  These policies include ones around stringent air quality (Kinney 2018; Rafaj et al. 2018; Soergel et al. 2021a);  efficient  and  safe  demand-side  technologies,  especially  cook  stoves  (Cameron  et  al.  2016); lifestyle  changes  (Bertram  et  al.  2018;  Grubler  et  al.  2018;  Soergel  et  al.  2021a);  industrial  and sectoral  policy  (Bertram  et  al.  2018);  agricultural  and  food  policies  (including  food  waste)  (van Vuuren et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a); international cooperation (Soergel et al. 2021a); as well as economic policies described in section 3.6. Recent research shows that mitigation is compatible with reductions in inequality and poverty (see Box 3.6 on poverty and inequality). Lower  demand  –  e.g.,  for  energy  and  land-intensive  consumption  such  as  meat  –  represents  a synergistic  strategy  for  achieving  ambitious  climate  mitigation  without  compromising  sustainable development  goals  (Grubler  et  al.  2018;  van  Vuuren et al.  2018;  Bertram et  al. 2018;  Kikstra  et al. 2021b; Soergel et al. 2021a) (high confidence). This is especially true for reliance on BECCS (Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021). Options that reduce agricultural demand (e.g., dietary change, reduced food waste) can have co-benefits for adaptation through reductions in demand for land and water (IPCC 2019a; Grubler et al. 2018; Bertram et al. 2018; Soergel et al. 2021a). While the impacts of climate change on agricultural output are expected to increase the population at risk of hunger, there is evidence suggesting population growth will be the dominant driver of hunger and undernourishment in Africa in 2050 (Hall et al. 2017). Meeting SDG5 relating to gender equality and  reproductive  rights  could  substantially  lower  population  growth,  leading  to  a  global  population lower than the 95% prediction range of the UN projections (Abel et al. 2016). Meeting SDG5 (gender equality, including via voluntary family planning (O’Sullivan 2018)) could thus minimise the risks to SDG2 (hunger) that are posed by meeting SDG13 (climate action).  3-100  Total pages: 156Page 109
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII literature that a focus on wellbeing and decent living standards for all can reduce disparities in access to basic needs for services concurrently with climate mitigation (Chapter 5, 5.2). Mitigation pathways in  which  national  redistribution  of  carbon  pricing  revenues  is  combined  with  international  climate finance,  achieve  poverty  reduction  globally  (Fujimori  et  al.  2020b;  Soergel  et  al.  2021b).  Carbon pricing  revenues  in  mitigation  pathways  consistent  with  limiting  temperature  increase  to  2°C  could also  contribute  to  finance  investment  needs  for  basic  infrastructure  (Jakob  et  al.  2016)  and  SDGs achievement (Franks et al. 2018). Several studies conclude that reaching higher income levels globally, beyond exiting extreme poverty, and achieving more qualitative social objectives and well-being, are associated with higher emissions (Ribas  et  al.  2017,  2019;  Scherer  et  al.  2018;  Fischetti  2018;  Hubacek  et  al.  2017b).  Studies  give divergent results on the effect of economic inequality reduction on emissions, with either an increase or  a  decrease  in  emissions  (Berthe  and  Elie  2015;  Lamb  and  Rao  2015;  Grunewald  et  al.  2017; Hubacek et al. 2017a,b; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Knight et al. 2017; Mader 2018; Rao and Min 2018; Liu  et  al.  2019;  Sager  2019;  Baležentis  et  al.  2020;  Liobikienė  2020;  Liobikienė  and  Rimkuvienė 2020;  Liu  et  al.  2020b;  Millward-Hopkins  and  Oswald  2021).  However,  the  absolute  effect  of economic  inequality  reduction  on  emissions  remains  moderate,  under  the  assumptions  tested.  For instance,  (Sager  2019)  finds  that  a  full  redistribution  of  income  leading  to  equality  among  US households in a counterfactual scenario for 2009 would raise emissions by 2.3%; and  (Rao and Min 2018) limit to 8% the maximum plausible increase in emissions that would accompany the reduction of  the  global  Gini  coefficient  from  its  current  level  of  0.55  to  a  level  of  0.3  by  2050.  Similarly, reduced income inequality would lead to a global energy demand increase of 7% (Oswald et al. 2021). Reconciling  mitigation  and  inequality  reduction  objectives  requires  policies  that  take  into  account both  objectives  at  all  stages  of  policy  making  (Markkanen  and  Anger-Kraavi  2019),  including focusing on the carbon intensity of lifestyles (Scherer et al. 2018), attention to sufficiency and equity (Fischetti 2018) and targeting the consumption of the richest and highest emitting households (Otto et al. 2019).In  modelled  mitigation  pathways,  inequality  in  per  capita  emissions  between  regions  are  generally reduced  over  time,  and  the  reduction  is  generally  more  pronounced  in  lower  temperature  pathways (Box  3.6  Figure  1).  Already  in  2030,  if  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  from  the  Paris Agreement are fully achieved, inequalities in per capita GHG emissions between countries would be reduced (Benveniste et al. 2018). 3-101  Total pages: 156Page 110
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Through  avoiding  impacts  of  climate  change,  which  fall  more  heavily  on  low-income  countries, communities and households and exacerbate poverty, mitigation reduces inequalities and poverty (see section 3.6.4.2). END BOX HERE The remainder of this section covers specific domains of sustainable development: food (3.7.2), water (3.7.3),  energy  (3.7.4),  health  (3.7.5),  biodiversity  (3.7.6)  and  multisector  -  Cities,  infrastructure, industry,  production  &  consumption  (3.7.7).  These  represent  the  areas  with  the  strongest  research connecting  mitigation  to  sustainable  development.  The  links  to  individual  SDGs  are  given  within these  sections.  Each  domain  covers  the  benefits  of  avoided  climate  impacts  and  the  implications (synergies and trade-offs) of mitigation efforts.  3.7.2Food The goal of SDG2 is to achieve “zero-hunger” by 2030. According to the UN (2015), over 25% of the global  population  currently  experience  food  insecurity  and  nearly  40%  of  these  experience  severe food insecurity, a situation worsened by the covid pandemic (Paslakis et al. 2021). 3.7.2.1Benefits of avoided climate impacts along mitigation pathways Climate  change  will  reduce  crop yields,  increase food  insecurity,  and negatively  influence  nutrition and  mortality  (high  confidence)  (AR6  WGII  Chapter  5).  Climate  mitigation  will  thus  reduce  these impacts,  and  hence  reduce  food  insecurity  (high  confidence).  The  yield  reduction  of  global  food production  will  increase  food  insecurity  and  influence  nutrition  and  mortality  (Springmann  et  al. 2016a; Hasegawa et al. 2014). For instance, (Springmann et al. 2016a) estimate that climate change could lead to  315,000-736,000  additional  deaths  by  2050,  though  these  could mostly  be  averted  by stringent  mitigation  efforts.  Reducing  warming  reduces  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  including extreme climates, on food production and risk of hunger (Hasegawa et al. 2014, 2021b).  Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways 3.7.2.2Recent  studies  explore  the  effect  of  climate  change  mitigation  on  agricultural  markets  and  food security  (Hasegawa  et  al.  2018;  Havlík  et  al.  2014;  Fujimori  et  al.  2019;  Doelman  et  al.  2019). Mitigation policies aimed at achieving 1.5-2°C, if not managed properly, could negatively affect the food security through changes in land and food prices  (high confidence), leading to increases in the population  at  risk  of  hunger  by  80  to  280  million  people  compared  to  baseline  scenarios.  These studies  assume  uniform  carbon  prices  on  AFOLU  sectors  (with  some  sectoral  caps)  and  do  not account for climate impacts on food production. 3-102  Total pages: 156Page 111
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII There  are  many  other  synergistic  measures  for  climate  mitigation  and  food  security.  Agricultural technological innovation can improve the efficiency of land use and food systems, thus reducing the pressure on land from increasing food demand (Foley et al. 2011; Humpenöder et al. 2018; Popp et al. 2014; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Doelman et al. 2019). Furthermore, decreasing consumption of animal products  could  contribute  to  SDG3.4  by  reducing  the  risk  of  non-communicable  diseases  (Garnett 2016). Taken  together,  climate  changes  will  reduce  crop  yields,  increase  food  insecurity  and  influence nutrition  and  mortality  (high  confidence)  (see  3.7.2.1).  However,  if  measures  are  not  properly designed,  mitigating  climate  change  will  also  negatively  impact  on  food  consumption  and  security. Additional  solutions  to  negative impacts  associated with  climate mitigation  on  food  production  and consumption  include  a  transition  to  a  sustainable  agriculture  and  food  system  that  is  less  resource intensive, more resilient to a changing climate, and in line with biodiversity and social targets (Kayal et al. 2019).  3.7.3Water Water  is  relevant  to  SDG  6  (clean  water  and  sanitation),  SDG  15  (ecosystem  protection  and  water systems),  and  SDG  Targets  12.4  and  3.9  (water  pollution  and  health).  This  section  discusses  water quantity, water quality, and water-related extremes. See 3.7.5 for water-related health effects. 3.7.3.1Benefits of avoided climate impacts along mitigation pathways Global  precipitation,  evapotranspiration,  runoff  and  water  availability  increase  with  warming (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Greve et al. 2018) (see also WGII Chapter 4). Climate change also affects the occurrence  of  and  exposure  to  hydrological  extremes  (high  confidence)  (Arnell  and  Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a; Naumann et al. 2018; Do et al. 2020)  (see  also  WGII  Chapter  4).  Climate  models  project  increases  in  precipitation  intensity  (high confidence), local flooding (medium confidence), and drought risk (very high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (see also WGII Chapter 4). The effect of climate change on water availability and hydrological extremes varies by region (high confidence) due to differences in the spatial patterns of projected precipitation changes  (Hanasaki et al.  2013;  Koutroulis  et  al.  2019;  Schewe  et  al.  2014;  Schlosser  et  al.  2014;  Asadieh  and  Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; Naumann et al. 2018) (see also WGII Chapter 4). Global exposure to water stress  is  projected  to  increase  with  increased  warming,  but  increases  will  not  occur  in  all  regions (Arnell  and  Lloyd-Hughes  2014;  Gosling  and  Arnell  2016;  Hanasaki  et  al.  2013;  IPCC  2019a; Schewe et al. 2014). 3-103  Total pages: 156Page 112
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Climate change can also affect water quality (both thermal and chemical) (Liu et al. 2017), leading to increases in stream temperature and nitrogen loading in rivers (Ballard et al. 2019).   3.7.3.2Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways The  effect  of  mitigation  on  water  demand  depends  on  the  mitigation  technologies  deployed  (high confidence)  (Bonsch  et  al.  2016;  Chaturvedi  et  al.  2013a,b;  Jakob  and  Steckel  2016;  Hejazi  et  al. 2014; Kyle et al. 2013; Fujimori et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Parkinson et al. 2019; Bijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2018; Graham et al. 2018; Hanasaki et al. 2013). Some mitigation options  could  increase  water  consumption  (volume  removed  and  not  returned)  while  decreasing withdrawals  (total  volume  of  water  removed,  some  of  which  may  be  returned)  (Kyle  et  al.  2013; Mouratiadou  et  al.  2016;  Fricko  et  al.  2016;  Parkinson  et  al.  2019).  Bioenergy  and  BECCS  can increase water withdrawals and water consumption (high confidence) (Bonsch et al. 2016; Chaturvedi et al. 2013a; Hejazi et al. 2014; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Kyle et al. 2013; Fujimori et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Parkinson et al. 2019; Yamagata et al. 2018; Séférian et al. 2018) (see also WGII Chapter 4). DACCS (Fuhrman et al. 2020) and CCS (Kyle et al. 2013; Fujimori et al. 2017)  could  increase  water  demand;  however,  the  implications  of  CCS  depend  on  the  cooling technology and when capture occurs (Magneschi et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Giannaris et al. 2020). Demand-side  mitigation  (e.g.,  dietary  change,  reduced  food  waste,  reduced  energy  demand)  can reduce water demand (Bajželj et al. 2014; Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Springmann et al. 2018; Green et  al.  2018).  Introducing  specific  measures  (e.g.,  environmental  flow  requirements,  improved efficiency,  priority  rules)  can  reduce  water  withdrawals  (Bertram  et  al.  2018;  Bijl  et  al.  2018; Parkinson et al. 2019). The effect of mitigation on water quality depends on the mitigation option, its implementation, and the aspect of quality considered (high confidence) (McElwee et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2019; Sinha et al. 2019; Ng et al. 2010; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Flörke et al. 2019; Karlsson et al. 2020). 3.7.4Energy Energy is relevant to SDG7 on sustainable and affordable energy access. Access to sufficient levels of reliable, affordable and renewable energy is essential for sustainable development. Currently, over 1 billion people still lack access to electricity (Ribas et al. 2019). 3.7.4.1Benefits of avoided climate impacts along mitigation pathways Climate  change  alters the  production  of  energy  through  changes  in temperature  (hydropower, fossil fuel,  nuclear,  solar,  bioenergy,  transmission  and  pipelines),  precipitation  (hydropower,  fossil  fuel, nuclear,  bioenergy),  windiness  (wind,  wave),  and  cloudiness  (solar)  (high  confidence).  Increases  in temperature reduce efficiencies of thermal power plants (e.g., fossil fuel and nuclear plants) with air-cooled condensers by 0.4-0.7% oC increase in ambient temperature (Cronin et al. 2018a; Yalew, S. G. et al. 2020; Simioni and Schaeffer 2019). Potentials and costs for renewable energy   technologies are also affected by climate change, though with considerable regional variation and uncertainty (Gernaat et al. 2021). Biofuel yields could increase or decrease depending on the level of warming, changes in precipitation, and the effect of CO2 fertilization (Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2021). Coastal energy facilities could potentially be impacted by sea-level rise (Brown et al. 2014). 3-104  Total pages: 156Page 113
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII US/Canada, and Latin America (Hock et al. 2019) as well as Africa and China (Bartos and Chester 2015;  Eyer  and  Wichman  2018;  Tarroja  et  al.  2016;  Savelsberg  et  al.  2018;  Ranzani  et  al.  2018; Zhang et al. 2018d; Conway et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2018; Gaupp et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019; Byers et al. 2018) have experienced changes in seasonality and availability. Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways 3.7.4.2Extending energy access to all in line with SDG7 is compatible with strong mitigation consistent with the Paris agreement (high confidence). The Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario projects that these twin goals can be achieved by relying heavily on energy efficiency and rapid social transformations (Grubler  et  al.  2018).  The  IEA’s  Sustainable  Development  Scenario  (IEA  2020a)  achieves development outcomes but with higher average energy use, and bottom-up modelling suggests that decent living standards could be provided to all in 2040-2050 with roughly 150 EJ, or 40% of current final energy use (Kikstra et al. 2021b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). The trade-offs between climate mitigation  and  increasing  energy  consumption  of  the  world’s  poorest  are  negligible  (Rao  and  Min 2018; Scherer et al. 2018). The additional energy demand to meet the basic cooling requirement in Global South is estimated to be much larger than the electricity needed to provide basic residential energy services universally via clean  and  affordable  energy,  as  defined  by  SDG7  (IEA  2019;  Mastrucci  et  al.  2019)    (high confidence). If conventional air conditioning systems are widely deployed to provide cooling, energy use could rise significantly (van Ruijven et al. 2019; Falchetta and Mistry 2021; Bezerra et al. 2021), thus creating a positive feedback further increasing cooling demand. However, the overall emissions are  barely  altered  by  the  changing  energy  demand  composition  with  reductions  in  heating  demand occurring  simultaneously  (Isaac  and  van  Vuuren  2009;  Labriet  et  al.  2015;  McFarland  et  al.  2015; Clarke et al. 2018). Some mitigation scenarios show price increases of clean cooking fuels, slowing the transition  to clean  cooking  fuels  (SDG  7.1)  and leaving  a  billion  people in 2050  still reliant  on solid fuels in South Asia (Cameron et al. 2016). In contrast, future energy infrastructure could improve reliability, thus lowering dependence on high-carbon,  high-air  pollution  backup  diesel  generators  (Farquharson  et  al.  2018)  that  are  often  used  to cope with unreliable power in developing countries (Maruyama Rentschler et al. 2019). There can be significant reliability issues where mini-grids are used to electrify rural areas (Numminen and Lund 2019). A stable, sustainable energy transition policy that considers national sustainable development in  the  short-  and  long-term  is  critical  in  driving  a  transition  to  an  energy  future  that  addresses  the trilemma of energy security, equity, and sustainability (La Viña et al. 2018). 3-105  Total pages: 156Page 114
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII increases in climate-sensitive health outcomes. In the U.S. in 2012, the financial burden in terms of deaths,  hospitalizations,  and  emergency  department  visits  for  ten  climate-sensitive  events  across  11 states were estimated to be USD 10.0 (2.7 – 24.6) billion in 2018 dollars (Limaye et al. 2019). 3.7.5.2Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways Transitioning toward equitable, low-carbon societies has multiple co-benefits for health and wellbeing (see  WGII  Chapter  7).  Health  benefits  can  be  gained  from  improvements  in  air  quality  through transitioning  to  renewable  energy  and  active  transport  (e.g.,  walking  and  cycling);  shifting  to affordable low-meat, plant-rich diets; and green buildings and nature-based solutions, such as green and blue urban infrastructure, as shown in Figure 3.40 (Iacobucci 2016). 3-106  Total pages: 156Page 115
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII The health co-benefits of the NDCs for 2040 were compared for two scenarios, one consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs and the other also placing health as a central focus of the  policies  (i.e.,  health  in  all  climate  policies  scenario)  (Hamilton  et  al.  2021),  for  Brazil,  China, Germany,  India,  Indonesia,  Nigeria,  South  Africa,  the  UK,  and  the  USA.  Modelling  of  the  energy, food and agriculture, and transport sectors, and associated risk factors related to mortality, suggested the  sustainable  pathways  scenario  could  result  in  annual  reductions  of  1.18  million  air  pollution-related  deaths,  5.86  million  diet-related  deaths,  and  1.15  million  deaths  due  to  physical  inactivity. Adopting the more ambitious health in all climate policies scenario could result in further reductions of 462,000 annual deaths attributable to air pollution, 572,000 annual deaths attributable to diet, and 943,000  annual  deaths  attributable  to  physical  inactivity.  These  benefits  were  attributable  to  the mitigation of direct greenhouse gas emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity. Cost-benefit  analyses  for  climate  mitigation  in  urban  settings  that  do  not  account  for  health  may underestimate  the  potential  cost  savings  and  benefits  (Hess  et  al.  2020).  The  net  health  benefits  of controlling air pollution as part of climate mitigation efforts could reach trillions of dollars annually, depending  on  the  air  quality  policies  adopted  globally  (Markandya  et  al.  2018;  Scovronick  et  al. 2019b). Air pollution reductions resulting from meeting the Paris Agreement targets were estimated to provide  health  co-benefits-to-mitigation  ratios  of  between  1.4  and  2.5  (Markandya  et  al.  2018).  In Asia,  the  benefit  of  air  pollution  reduction  through  mitigation  measures  were  estimated  to  reduce premature  mortality  by  0.79  million,  with  an  associated  health  benefit  of  USD2.8  trillion  versus mitigation costs of USD840 billion, equating to 6% and 2% of GDP, respectively  (Xie et al. 2018). Similarly, stabilizing radiative forcing to 3.4 W/m2 in South Korea could cost USD1.3-8.5 billion in 2050  and  could  lead  to  a  USD23.5  billion  cost  reduction  from  the  combined  benefits  of  avoided premature  mortality,  health  expenditures,  and  lost  work  hours  (Kim  et  al.  2020).  The  health  co-benefits related to physical exercise and reduced air pollution largely offset the costs of implementing low CO2 emitting urban mobility strategies in three Austrian cities (Wolkinger et al. 2018). Just in the United States of America, over the next 50 years, a 2°C pathway could prevent roughly 4.5 million  premature  deaths,  about  3.5  million  hospitalizations  and  emergency  room  visits,  and approximately 300 million lost workdays (Shindell 2020).The estimated yearly benefits of USD700 billion were more than the estimated cost of the energy transition.    3-107  Total pages: 156Page 116
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII plants  and  4%  of  vertebrates  (Warren  et  al.  2018).  Incidents  of  migration  of  invasive  species, including  pests  and  diseases,  are  also attributable to climate  change,  with  negative impacts  on food security  and  vector-borne  diseases.  Moreover,  if  climate  change  reduces  crop  yields,  cropland  may expand – a primary driver of biodiversity loss – in order to meet food demand (Molotoks et al. 2020). Land  restoration  and  halting  land  degradation  under  all  mitigation  scenarios  has  the  potential  for synergy between mitigation and adaptation. 3.7.6.1.2Marine and coastal ecosystems Marine ecosystems are being affected by climate change and growing non-climate pressures including temperature  change,  acidification,  land-sourced  pollution,  sedimentation,  resource  extraction  and habitat  destruction  (high  confidence)  (IPCC  2019b;  Bindoff  et  al.  2019).  The  impacts  of  climate drivers  and  their  combinations  vary  across  taxa  (WGII  Chapter  3).  The  danger  or  warming  and acidification to coral reefs, rocky shores and kelp forests is well established (high confidence) (WGII Chapter  3).  Migration  towards  optimal  thermal  and  chemical  conditions  (Burrows  et  al.  2019) contributes  to  large  scale  redistribution  of  fish  and  invertebrate  populations,  and  major  impacts  on global marine biomass production and maximum sustainable yield (Bindoff et al. 2019). Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways 3.7.6.2Mitigation  measures  have  the  potential  to  reduce  the  progress  of  negative  impacts  on  ecosystems, although it is unlikely that all impacts can be mitigated  (high confidence) (Ohashi et al. 2019). The specifics  of  mitigation  achievement  are  crucial,  since  large-scale  deployment  of  some  climate mitigation and land-based CDR measures could have deleterious impacts on biodiversity (Santangeli et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2018). Climate  change  mitigation  actions  to  reduce  or  slow  negative  impacts  on  ecosystems  are  likely  to support  the  achievement  of  SDGs  2,  3,  6,  12,  14  and  15.  Some  studies  show  that  stringent  and constant  GHG  mitigation  practices  bring  a  net  benefit  to  global  biodiversity  even  if  land-based mitigation measures are also adopted (Ohashi et al. 2019), as opposed to delayed action which would require much more widespread use of BECCS. Scenarios based on demand reductions of energy and land-based production are expected to avoid many such consequences, due to their minimized reliance on  BECCS  (Grubler  et  al.  2018;  Conijn  et  al.  2018;  Bowles  et  al.  2019;  Soergel  et  al.  2021a). Stringent mitigation that includes reductions in demand for animal-based foods and food-waste could also  relieve  pressures  on  land-use  and  biodiversity  (high  confidence),  both  directly  by  reducing agricultural land requirements (Leclère et al. 2020) and indirectly by reducing the need for land-based CDR (van Vuuren et al. 2018). 3.7.7.1Benefits of avoided climate impacts along mitigation pathways By  2100,  urban  population  will  be  almost  double  and  more  urban  areas  will  be  built  (Jiang  and O’Neill  2017),  although  Covid-19  may  modify  these  trends  (Kii  2021).

 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII projected  air  temperature  changes  in  cities,  including  amplifying  heat  waves  (see  WGI  Chapter  10, Box  10.3).  Benefits  of  climate  mitigation  in  urban  areas  include  reducing  heat,  air  pollution  and flooding.  Industrial  infrastructure  and  production-consumption  supply  networks  also  benefit  from avoided impacts. Implications of mitigation efforts along pathways 3.7.7.2Many  co-benefits  to  urban  mitigation  actions  (see  Chapter  8,  Section  8.2.1)  that  improve  the liveability of cities and contribute to achieving SDG11. In particular, compact, urban form, efficient technologies  and  infrastructure  can  play  a  valuable  role  in  mitigation  by  reducing  energy  demand (Güneralp et al. 2017; Creutzig et al. 2016), thus averting carbon lock-in, while reducing land sprawl and hence increasing carbon storage and biodiversity  (D’Amour et al. 2017). Benefits of mitigation include  air  quality  improvements  from  decreased  traffic  and  congestion  when  private  vehicles  are displaced  by  other  modes;  health  benefits  from  increases  in  active  travel;  and  lowered  urban  heat island effects from green-blue infrastructures (section 8.2.1). However, increasing urban density or enlarging urban green spaces can increase property prices  and reduce  affordability  (Section  8.2.1).  Raising  living  conditions  for  slum  dwellers  &  people  living  in informal  settlements  will  require  significant  materials  and  energy;  however,  regeneration  can  be conducted in ways that avoid carbon-intense infrastructure lock-in (see Chapter 8 & 9). Cities affect other regions through supply chains (Marinova et al. 2020). Sustainable  production,  consumption  and  management  of  natural  resources  are  consistent  with,  and necessary  for,  mitigation  (Chapters  5  &  11).  Demand-side  measures  can  lower  requirements  for upstream  material  and  energy  use  (Chapter  5).  In  terms  of  industrial  production,  transformational changes across sectors will be necessary for mitigation (Chapter 11, sections 11.3 and 11.4). Addressing  multiple  SDG  arenas  requires  new  systemic  thinking  in  the  areas  of  governance  and policy, such as those proposed by (Sachs et al. 2019). 3.8Feasibility of socio/techno/economic transitions The  objective  of  this  section  is  to  discuss  concepts  of  feasibility  in  the  context  of  the  low  carbon transition  and  pathways.  We  aim  to  identify  drivers  of  low  carbon  scenarios  feasibility  and  to highlight enabling conditions which cam ameliorate feasibility concerns. Regarding  scenarios,  the  feasibility  ‘what’  question  is  the  one  most  commonly  dealt  with  in  the literature, though most of the studies have focused on expanding low carbon system, and yet political 3-109  Total pages: 156Page 118
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII constraints might arise mostly from phasing out fossil fuel-based ones (Spencer et al. 2018; Fattouh et al. 2019). The ‘when and where’ dimension can also be related to the scenario assessment, but only insofar  the  models  generating  them  can  differentiate  time  and  geographical  contextual  factors. Distinguishing mitigation potential by regional institutional capacity has a significant influence on the costs of stabilizing climate (Iyer et al. 2015c). The ‘whom’ question is the most difficult to capture by scenarios, given the multitude of actors involved as well as their complex interactions. The focus of socio-technical transition sciences on the co-evolutionary processes can shed light on the dynamics of feasibility (Nielsen et al. 2020). The  when-where-whom  distinction  allows  depicting  a  feasibility frontier  beyond  which implementation  challenges  prevent  mitigation  action  (Jewell  and  Cherp  2020).  Even  if  the  current feasibility  frontier  appears restraining in  some  jurisdictions, it  is  context-dependent and  dynamic  as innovation proceeds and institutional capacity builds up (Nielsen et al. 2020). The question is whether the feasibility frontier can move faster than the pace at which the carbon budget is being exhausted. Jewell et al. (2019) show that the emission savings from the pledges of premature retirement of coal plants  is  150  times  less  than  globally  committed  emissions  from  existing  coal  power  plants.  The pledges  come  from  countries  with  high  institutional  capacity  and  relatively  low  shares  of  coal  in electricity.  Other  factors  currently  limiting  the  capacity  to  steer  transitions  at  the  necessary  speed include  the  electoral  market  orientation  of  politicians  (Willis  2017),  the  status  quo  orientation  of senior public officials (Geden 2016), path dependencies created by 'instrument constituencies' (Béland and Howlett 2016), or the benefits of deliberate inconsistencies between talk, decisions and actions in climate  policy  (Rickards  et  al.  2014).  All  in  all,  a  number  of  different  delay  mechanisms  in  both science and policy have been identified to potentially impede climate goal achievement (Karlsson and Gilek 2020) - see also Chapter 13. In addition to its contextual and dynamic nature, feasibility is a multi-dimensional concept. The IPCC 1.5°C special report distinguishes 6 dimensions of feasibility: geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological,  economic,  socio-cultural  and  institutional.  At  the  individual  option  level,  different mitigation  strategies  face  various  barriers  as  well  as  enablers  (see  Chapter  6  for  the  option-level assessment).  However,  a  systemic  transformation  involves  interconnections  of  a  wide  range  of indicators.  Model-based  assessments  are  meant  to  capture  the  integrative  elements  of  the  transition and  of  associated feasibility  challenges.  However, the  translation  of  model-generated pathways into feasibility concerns (Rogelj et al. 2018b) has developed only recently. Furthermore, multiple forms of knowledge can be mobilized to support strategic decision-making and complement scenario analysis (Turnheim and Nykvist 2019). We discuss both approaches next. 3-110  Total pages: 156Page 119
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII not  a  random  process,  but  a  function  of  the  characteristics  of  the  models,  analysing  only  reported outcomes leads to statistical biases (Tavoni and Tol 2010). Although  model-feasibility  differs  distinctly  from  feasibility  in  the  real  world,  it  can  indicate  the relative  challenges  of  low  carbon  scenarios  -  primarily  when  performed  in  a  model  ensemble  of sufficient  size.  Riahi  et  al.  (2015)  interpreted  infeasibility  across  a  large  number  of  models  as  an indication of increased risk that the transformation may not be attainable due to technical or economic concerns. All models involved in a model comparison of 1.5°C targets  (Rogelj et al. 2018b) (Table S1) were able to solve under favourable underlying socio-economic assumptions (SSP1), but none for the more challenging SSP3. This interpretation of feasibility was used to highlight the importance of socio-economic  drivers  for  attaining  climate  stabilization.  Gambhir  et  al.  (2017)  constrained  the models to historically observed rates of change and found that it would no longer allow to solve for 2°C, highlighting the need for rapid technological change. 3.8.2.2Scenario feasibility Evaluating  the  feasibility  of  scenarios  involves  several  steps  (see  Figure  3.41).  First,  one  need  to identify  which  dimensions  of  feasibility to  focus  on.  Then,  for  each  dimension,  one  needs  to  select relevant indicators for which sufficient empirical basis exists and which are an output of models (or at least of a sufficient number of them). Then, thresholds marking different levels of feasibility concerns are  defined  based  on  available  literature,  expert  elicitations  and  empirical  analysis  based  on appropriately  chosen  historical  precedents.  Finally,  scenario  feasibility  scores  are  obtained  for  each indicator,  and  where  needed  aggregated  up  in  time  or  dimensions,  as  a  way  to  provide  an  overall appraisal of feasibility trade-offs, depending on the timing, disruptiveness and scale of transformation.  3-111  Total pages: 156Page 120
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Scenarios  rely  more  on  conventional  technologies  based  on  existing  infrastructure  (such  as  nuclear and CCS) than what forecasted by experts. Overall, the technology assessment of the feasibility space highlights that Paris-compliant transformations would have few precedents, but not zero (Cherp et al. 2021). Recent approaches have addressed multiple dimensions of feasibility, an important advancement since social and institutional aspects are as if not more important than technology ones  (Jewell and Cherp 2020). Feasibility corridors of scenarios based on their scale, rate of change and disruptiveness have been identified  (Kriegler  et  al.  2018b;  Warszawski  et  al.  2021).  The  reality  check  shows  that  many 1.5°C compatible scenarios violate the feasibility corridors. The ones which didn’t are associated with a greater coverage of the available mitigation levers (Warszawski et al. 2021). Brutschin et al. (2021) proposed an operational framework covering all six dimensions of feasibility. They developed a set of multi-dimensional metrics capturing the timing, disruptiveness and the scale of  the  transformative  change  within  each  dimension  (as  in  Kriegler  et  al.  (2018b)).  Thresholds  of feasibility  risks  of  different  intensity  are  obtained  through  the  review  of  the  relevant  literature  and empirical  analysis  of  historical  data.  Novel  indicators  include  governance  levels  (Andrijevic  et  al. 2020a).  The  17  bottom-up  indicators  are  then  aggregated  up  across  time  and  dimension,  as  way  to highlight  feasibility  trade-offs.  Aggregation  is  done  via  compensatory  approaches  such  as  the geometric  mean.  This  is  employed,  for  instance,  for  the  Human  Development  Index.  A  conceptual example of this approach as applied to the IPCC AR6 scenarios database is shown in Figure 3.42 and further described in the Annex. In Figure 3.43, we show the results of applying the methodology of Brutschin et al. (2021) to the AR6 scenarios  database.

Different  dimensions  pose  differentiated  challenges:  for  example,  institutional feasibility  challenges  appear  to  be  the  most  relevant,  in  line  with  the  qualitative  literature.  Thus, feasibility concerns might be particularly relevant in countries with weaker institutional capacity. The Figure also highlights the key role of policy and technology, as enabling factors. In particular (Panel B),  internationally  coordinated  and  immediate  emission  reductions  allow  to  smooth  out  feasibility concerns  and  reduce  long term  challenges compared  to  delayed  policy action,  as  a result  of  a more gradual transition and lower requirements of CO2 removals. For the same climate objective, different illustrative mitigation pathways entail somewhat different degrees and distributions of implementation challenges (panel C). 3-113  Total pages: 156Page 122

Overlayed are the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (LP, SP, Ren: C1 category; Neg, GS: C3 category) 3.8.3Feasibility in the light of socio-technical transitions The limitations associated with quantitative low-carbon transition pathways stem from a predominant reliance  on  techno-economic  considerations  with  a  simplified  or  non-existent  representation  of  the socio-political  and  institutional  agreement.  Accompanying  the  required  deployment  of  low  carbon technologies will be the formation of new socio-technical systems (Bergek et al. 2008). With a socio-technical  system  being  defined  as  a  cluster  of  elements  comprising  of  technology,  regulation,  user practices and markets, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks, and supply networks (Geels and Geels 2005; Hofman et al. 2004); the interrelationship between technological systems and social  systems  must  be  comprehensively  understood.  It  is  of  vital  importance  that  the  pro-cess  of technical  change  must  considered  in  its  institutional  and  social  context  so  as  to  ascertain  potential transition barriers which in turn provide an indication of pathway feasibility. In order to address the multitudinous challenges associated with low-carbon transition feasibility and governance, it has been opined  that  the  robustness  of  evaluating  pathways  may  be  improved  by  the  bridging  of  differing quantitative-qualitative analytical approaches (Haxeltine et al. 2008; Foxon et al. 2010; Hughes 2013; Wangel et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015; Turnheim et al. 2015; Geels et al. 2016a,b, 2018; Moallemi et al. 2017;  De  Cian  et  al.  2018;  Li  and  Strachan  2019).  The  rationale  for  such  analytical  bridging  is  to rectify  the  issue  that  in  isolation  each  disciplinary  approach  only  can  generate  a  fragmented comprehension of the transition pathway with the consequence being an incomplete identification of associated challenges in terms of feasibility. Concerning low-carbon transition pathways generated by IAMs,  it  has  been  argued  that  a  comprehensive  analysis  should  include  social  scientific  enquiry (Geels  et  al.  2016a,  2018;  van  Sluisveld  et  al.  2018b).  The  normative  analysis  of  IAM  pathways assists in the generation of a vision or the formulation of a general plan with this being complemented by socio-technical transition theory (Geels et al. 2016a). Such an approach thereby allowing for the socio-political  feasibility  and  the  social  acceptance  and  legitimacy  of  low-carbon  options  to  be considered. Combining computer models and the multi-level perspective can help identify ‘transition bottlenecks’  (Geels  et  al.  2018).  Similarly,  increased  resolution  of  integrated  assessment  models’ actors  has  led  to  more  realistic  narratives  of  transition  in  terms  of  granularity  and  behaviour (McCollum  et  al.  2017;  van  Sluisveld  et  al.  2018b).  Increased  data  availability  of  actual  behaviour from  smart  technology  lowers  the  barriers  to  representing  behavioural  change  in  computer simulations,  and  thus  better  represent  crucial  demand  side  transformations  (Creutzig  et  al.  2018). Increasing the model resolution is a meaningful way forward. However, integrating a much broader combination of real-life aspects and dynamics into models could lead to an increased complexity that could restrict them to smaller fields of applications (De Cian et al. 2018). Other elements of feasibility relate to social justice, which could be essential to enhance the political and  public  acceptability  of  the  low  carbon  transition.  Reviewing  the  literature,  one  study  finds  that employing social justice as an orienting principle can increase the political feasibility of low carbon policies (Patterson et al. 2018). Three elements are identified as key: i) protecting vulnerable people from climate change impacts, ii), protecting people from disruptions of transformation, iii), enhancing the process of envisioning and implementing an equitable post-carbon society. 3-114  Total pages: 156Page 123
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII 3.8.4Enabling factors There  is  strong  agreement  that  the  climate  policy  institutional  framework  as  well  as  technological progress have a profound impact on the attainability of low carbon pathways. Delaying international cooperation  reduces  the  available  carbon  budget  and  locks  into  carbon  intensive  infrastructure exacerbating implementation challenges (Clarke et al. 2009; Bosetti et al. 2009; Krey and Riahi 2009; Boucher et  al.  2009;  Keppo  and  Rao  2007;  van  Vliet  et  al.  2009;  Knopf  et  al.  2011;  Luderer  et  al. 2013; Jakob et al. 2012; Aboumahboub et al. 2014; Bertram et al. 2021; Popp et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2013a;  Riahi  et  al.  2015;  Kriegler  et  al.  2014a;  Gambhir  et  al.  2017).  Similarly,  technological availability  influences  the  feasibility  of  climate  stabilization,  though  differently  for  different technologies (Iyer et al. 2015a; Kriegler et al. 2014a; Riahi et al. 2015). One of the most relevant factors affecting mitigation pathways and their feasibility is the rate and kind of  socio-economic  development.  For  example,  certain    socio-economic  trends    and    assumptions  about  policy  effectiveness  preclude  achieving  stringent  mitigation  futures  (Rogelj et al. 2018b). The risk of failure increases markedly  in  high  growth,  unequal  and/or  energy-intensive  worlds  -such as those characterized by the shared socio-economic pathways SSP3,  SSP4  and  SSP5. On the other  hand,  socio-economic  development  conducive  to  mitigation  relieves  the  energy  sector transformation  from  relying  on  large  scale  technology  development:  for  example,  the  amount  of biomass with CCS in SSP1 is one third of that in SSP5. The reason why socio-economic trends matter so  much  is  that  they  both  affect  the  CO2  emissions  in  counterfactual  scenarios  as  well  as  the mitigation  capacity  (Riahi  et  al.  2017;  Rogelj  et  al.  2018b).  Economic  growth  assumptions  are  the most  important  determinant  of  scenario  emissions  (Marangoni  et  al.  2017).  De-  and  post-growth scenarios have been suggested as valuable alternatives to be considered  (Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and  Lenzen  2021),  though  substantial  challenges  remain  regarding  political  feasibility  (Keyßer  and Lenzen 2021). The type of policy instrument assumed to drive the decarbonization process also play a vital role for determining feasibility. The majority of scenarios exploring climate stabilization pathways in the past have  focused  on  uniform  carbon  pricing  as  the  most  efficient  instrument  to  regulate  emissions. However,  carbon taxation raises  political  challenges  (Beiser-McGrath  and  Bernauer  2019),  see  also Chapter 13 and 14. Carbon pricing will transfer economic surplus from consumers and producers to the government. Losses for producers will be highly concentrated in those industries possessing fixed or durable assets with “high asset specificity” (Murphy 2002; Dolphin et al. 2020). These sectors have opposed  climate  jurisdictions  (Jenkins  2014).  Citizens  are  sensitive  to  rising  energy  prices,  though revenue recycling can be used to increase support (Carattini et al. 2019). A recent model comparison project confirms findings from the extant literature: using revenues to reduce pre-existing capital or, to a lesser extent, labour taxes, reduces policy costs and eases distributional concerns (Mcfarland et al. 2018; Barron et al. 2018). 3-115  Total pages: 156Page 124
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII 3.9Methods of assessment and gaps in knowledge and data 3.9.1AR6 mitigation pathways The analysis in this chapter relies on the available literature as well as an assessment of the scenarios contained in the AR6 scenarios database. Scenarios were submitted by research and other institutions following an open call (see Annex III Part II). The scenarios included in the AR6 scenarios database are  an  unstructured  ensemble,  as  they  are  from  multiple  underlying  studies  and  depend  on  which institutions chose to submit scenarios to the database. As noted in Section 3.2, they do not represent the  full  scenario  literature  or  the  complete  set  of  possible  scenarios.  For  example,  scenarios  that include  climate  change  impacts  or economic  degrowth  are not  fully represented,  as  these  scenarios, with  a  few  exceptions,  were  not  submitted  to  the  database.  Additionally,  sensitivity  studies,  which could  help elucidate  model  behaviour and  drivers of change,  are  mostly  absent from  the  database  - though examples exist in the literature (Marangoni et al. 2017). The  AR6  scenarios  database  contains  3131  scenarios  of  which  2425  with  global  scope  were considered  by  this  chapter,  generated  by  almost  100  different  model  versions,  from  more  than  50 model  families.  Of  the  1686  vetted  scenarios,  1202  provided  sufficient  information  for  a  climate categorization. Around 46% of the pathways are consistent with an end of century temperature of  at least likely limiting warming to below 2°C. There are many ways of constructing scenarios that limit warming to a particular level and the choice of scenario construction has implications for the timing of both net zero CO2 and GHG emissions and the deployment of CDR (Emmerling et al. 2019; Rogelj et  al.  2019b;  Johansson  et  al.  2020).  The  AR6  scenarios  database  includes  scenarios  where temperature is temporarily exceeded (40% of all scenarios in the database have median temperature in 2100 that is 0.1C lower than median peak temperature). Climate stabilization scenarios are typically implemented  by  assuming a  carbon  price  rising  at  a particular rate  per  year,  though that rate  varies across  model,  scenario,  and  time  period.  Standard  scenarios  assume  a  global  single  carbon  price  to minimize  policy  costs.  Cost  minimizing  pathways  can  be  reconciled  with  equity  considerations through posterior international transfers. Many scenarios extrapolate current policies and include non-market, regulatory instruments such as technology mandates.  3-116  Total pages: 156Page 125
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII the  mitigation  potential  of  a  given  sector.  There  is  an  increasing  focus  in  IAM  studies  on  SDGs (Section  3.7),  with  some  studies  reporting  the  implications  of  mitigation  pathways  on  SDGs  (e.g., Bennich  et  al.  (2020))  and  others  using  achieving  SDGs  as  a  constraint  on  the  scenario  itself  (van Vuuren et al. 2015; Soergel et al. 2021a). However, IAMs are still limited in the SDGs they represent, often  focusing  on  energy,  water,  air  pollution  and  land.  On  the  economic  side,  the  majority  of  the models report information on marginal costs (i.e., carbon price). Only a subset provides full economic implications  measured  by  either  economic  activity  or  welfare.  Also  often  missing,  is  detail  about economic inequality within countries or large aggregate regions.  For further details about the models and scenarios, see Annex III. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) FAQ 3.1 – Is it possible to stabilize warming without net negative CO2 and GHG emissions? Yes. Achieving net zero CO2 emissions and sustaining them into the future is sufficient to stabilize the CO2-induced warming signal which scales with the cumulative net amount of CO2 emissions. At the  same  time,  the  warming  signal  of  non-CO2  GHGs  can  be  stabilized  or  reduced  by  declining emissions  that  lead  to  stable  or  slightly  declining  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere.  For  short-lived GHGs with atmospheric lifetimes of less than 20 years, this is achieved when residual emissions are reduced  to  levels  that  are  lower  than  the  natural  removal  of  these  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  Taken together,  mitigation  pathways  that  bring  CO2  emissions  to  net  zero  and  sustain  it,  while  strongly reducing non-CO2 GHGs to levels that stabilize or decline their aggregate warming contribution, will stabilize warming without using net negative CO2 emissions and with positive overall GHG emissions when  aggregated  using  GWP100.  A  considerable  fraction  of  pathways  limiting  warming  to  1.5°C with  no  or  limited  overshoot  and  likely  limiting  warming  to  2°C,  respectively,  do  not  or  only marginally  (<10  GtCO2  cumulative  until  2100)  deploy  net  negative  CO2  emissions  (26%  and  46%, respectively)  and  do  not  reach  net  zero  GHG  emissions  by  the  end  of  the  century  (48%  and  70%, respectively).  This  is  no  longer  the  case  in  pathways  that  return  warming  to  1.5°C  after  a  high overshoot (typically  > 0.1°C).  All  of  these pathways deploy net negative  emissions  on  the  order of 330 (26-623 GtCO2) (median and 5th-95th percentile) and 87% achieve net negative GHGs emissions in AR6 GWP-100 before the end of the century. Hence, global net negative CO2 emissions, and net zero or net negative GHG emissions, are only needed to decline, not to stabilize global warming. The deployment  of  carbon  dioxide  removal  (CDR)  is  distinct  from  the  deployment  of  net  negative  CO2 emissions, because it is also used to neutralize residual CO2 emissions to achieve and sustain net zero CO2 emissions. CDR deployment can be considerable in pathways without net negative emissions and all pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C use it to some extent.  3-117  Total pages: 156Page 126
 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 3 IPCC AR6 WGIII Not all emissions can be avoided. Achieving net zero CO2 emissions globally therefore requires deep emissions cuts across all sectors and regions, along with active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to balance remaining emissions that may be too difficult, too costly or impossible to abate at that time. Achieving  global  net  zero  GHG  emissions  would  require,  in  addition,  deep  reductions  of  non-CO2 emissions and additional CO2 removals to balance remaining non-CO2 emissions. Not all regions and sectors must reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions individually to achieve global net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, respectively; instead, positive emissions in one sector or region can be  compensated  by  net  negative  emissions  from  another  sector  or  region.  The  time  each  sector  or region reaches net zero CO2 or GHG emissions depends on the mitigation options available, the cost of  those  options,  and  the  policies  implemented  (including  any  consideration  of  equity  or  fairness). Most modelled pathways that likely limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels and below use land-based CO2 removal such as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS to achieve net zero CO2 and net zero GHG emissions even while some CO2 and non-CO2 emissions continue to occur. Pathways with more demand-side interventions that limit the amount of energy we use, or where the diet that we consume is changed, can achieve net zero CO2, or net zero GHG emissions with less carbon dioxide removal. All available studies require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero; that  is,  there  are  no  studies  where  absolute  zero  GHG  or  even  CO2  emissions  are  reached  by  deep emissions reductions alone.   Total  GHG  emissions  are  greater  than  emissions  of  CO2  only;  reaching  net  zero  CO2  emissions therefore  occurs  earlier,  by  up  to  several  decades,  than  net  zero  GHG  emissions  in  all  modelled pathways. In most modelled pathways that likely limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels and below  in  the  most  cost-effective  way,  the  AFOLU  and  energy  supply  sectors  reach  net  zero  CO2 emissions  several  decades earlier than  other  sectors; however, many  pathways  show  much reduced, but still positive net GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector in 2100. FAQ 3.3 – How plausible are high emissions scenarios, and how do they inform policy? IAMs are used to develop a wide range of scenarios describing future trajectories for greenhouse gas emissions based on a wide set of assumptions regarding socio-economic development, technological changes, political development and climate policy. Typically, the IAM-based scenarios can be divided into  a)  reference  scenarios  (describing  possible  trajectories  in  the  absence  of  new  stringent  climate policies)  and b) mitigation  scenarios (describing the  impact  of  various  climate  policy  assumptions). Reference  scenarios  typically  result  in  high  emissions  and,  subsequently,  high  levels  of  climate change (in the order of 2.5-4 °C during the 21st century). The purpose of such reference scenarios is to  explore  the  consequences  of  climate  change  and  act  as  a  reference  for  mitigation  scenarios.  The possible  emission  levels  for  reference  scenarios  diverge  from  stabilising  and  even  slowly  declining emissions  (e.g.,  for  current  policy  scenarios  or  SSP1)  to  very  high  emission  levels  (e.g.,  SSP5  and RCP8.5). The latter leads to nearly 5 °C of warming by the end of the century for medium climate sensitivity. Hausfather and  Peters  (2020)  pointed  out  that  since  2011,  the  rapid  development  of renewable energy technologies and emerging climate policy have made it considerably less likely that emissions  could  end  up  as  high  as  RCP8.5.  This  means  that  reaching  emissions  levels  as  high  as RCP8.5 has become less likely. Still, high emissions cannot be ruled out for many reasons, including political factors and, for instance, higher than anticipated population and economic growth. Climate projections of RCP8.5 can also result from strong feedbacks of climate change on (natural) emission sources  and  high  climate  sensitivity  (see  WGI  Chapter  7).  Therefore,  their  median  climate  impacts might also materialise while following a lower emission path (e.g., Hausfather and Betts (2020)).  All-in-all, this means that high-end scenarios have become considerably less likely since AR5 but cannot be ruled out. High-end scenarios (like RCP8.5) can be very useful to explore high-end risks of climate change  but  are  not  typical  ‘business-as-usual”  projections  and  should  therefore  not  be  presented  as such. 3-118  Total pages: 156Page 127

 Chapter 3 5 12-14 Chapter 3 81 Chapter 3 40 7-8 4-6 Replace: Pathways accelerating actions compared to current NDCs that reduce annual GHG emissions to 47 (38-51) GtCO2-eq by 2030, or 3-9 GtCO2-eq below projected emissions from fully implementing current NDCs reduce the mitigation challenge for likely limiting warming to 2°C after 2030. WIth: Pathways accelerating actions compared to NDCs announced prior to COP26 that reduce annual GHG emissions to 48 (38-52) GtCO2-eq by 2030, or 2-9 GtCO2-eq below projected emissions from fully implementing NDCs announced prior to COP26, reduce the mitigation challenge for likely limiting warming to 2°C after 2030. This closes the implementation gap for the NDCs, and in addition falls below the emissions range implied by implementing unconditional and conditional elements of NDCs by 2-9 GtCO2-eq. Replace: As they need to reach net zero CO2 only a few years later, with 2030 CO2 emission levels being around twice as high, they imply post-2030 CO2 emissions reduction rates that are almost double that of pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot With: As they need to reach net zero CO2 only a few years later, from 2030 CO2 emission levels that are about as high as 2020 levels, they imply post-2030 CO2 emissions reduction rates that are substantially higher (by around 30%) than in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot Chapter 3 40 Footnote 6  Replace Pathways that follow emission levels projected from the implementation of current NDCs until 2030 and that still likely limit warming to 2°C reach net zero CO2 emissions during 2065 - 2070 (2060 - ...) With Pathways that follow emission levels projected from the implementation of current NDCs until 2030 and that still likely limit warming to 2°C reach net zero CO2 emissions during 2065 - 2070 (2060 - 2100) Replace: the time lag between reaching net zero CO2 and net zero GHG is 11-14 (6-40) years and the amount of net negative CO2 emissions deployed to balance non-CO2 emissions at the time of net zero is -6 to -7 (-10 to -4) GtCO2 With: the time lag between reaching net zero CO2 and net zero GHG is 12-14 (7-39) years and the amount of net negative CO2 emissions deployed to balance non-CO2 emissions at the time of net zero GHG is around -7 (-10 to -4) GtCO2 Cross-chapter box 3 Figure 1 to be updated to accommodate minor revisions to GHG emissions data shown in the left column.
