      <td>Diversification of production systems through promotion of Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS; also known as\nunderstudied, neglected, orphan, lost or disadvantaged crops) offers adaptation opportunities to climate change, particularly in\nmountains. Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS) have a potential to improve food security and at the same time help protect\nand conserve traditional knowledge and biodiversity. Scaling-up NUS requires training farmers and other stakeholders on ways to\nadopt adequate crop management, quality seed, select varieties, farming systems, soil management, development of new products,\nand market opportunities (Padulosi et al. 2013). Farmers in the Rasuwa district, in the mid-hills of Nepal, prefer to cultivate local\nbean, barley, millet and local maize, rather than commodity crops because they are more tolerant to water stress and extremely\ncold conditions (Adhikari et al. 2017). Farmers in the high-altitude, cold climate of Nepal prefer local barley with its short growing\nperiod because of a shorter growing window. Buckwheat is commonly grown in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region mainly\nbecause it grows fast and suppresses weeds. In Pakistan, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) grew and produced well under saline\nand marginal soil where other crops would not grow (Adhikari et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>At the same time, in many parts of the HKH region, a substantial proportion of the population is facing malnutrition. Various factors\nare responsible for this, and lack of diversity in food and nutrition resulting from production and consumption of few crops is one of\nthem. In the past, food baskets in this region consisted of many different edible plant species, many of which are now neglected and\nunderutilised. This is because almost all the efforts of the Green Revolution after 1960 focused on major crops. Four crops, namely rice,\nwheat, maize and potato, account for about 60% of global plant-derived energy supply (Padulosi et al. 2013).</td>

      <td>While the Green Revolution technologies substantially increased the yield of few crops and allowed countries to reduce hunger,\nthey also resulted in inappropriate and excessive use of agrochemicals, inefficient water use, loss of beneficial biodiversity, water\nand soil pollution and significantly reduced crop and varietal diversity. With farming systems moving away from subsistence-based\nto commercial farming, farmers are also reluctant to grow these local crops because of low return, poor market value and lack of\nknowledge about their nutritional environmental value.</td>

      <td>However, transition from traditional diets based on local foods to a commercial crop-based diet with high fats, salt, sugar and\nprocessed foods, increased the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart diseases and certain types\nof cancer (Abarca-G&#243;mez et al. 2017; NCD-RisC 2016b, 2017b). This &#8216;hidden hunger&#8217; &#8211; enough calories, but insufficient vitamins &#8211;\nis increasingly evident in mountainous communities including the HKH region.</td>

      <td>Internationally, there is rising interest in NUS, not only because they present opportunities for fighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition,\nbut also because of their role in mitigating climate risk in agricultural production systems. NUS play an important role in mountain\nagroecosystems because mountain agriculture is generally low-input agriculture, for which many NUS are well adapted.</td>

      <td>In the HKH region, mountains are agroecologically suitable for cultivation of traditional food crops, such as barley, millet, sorghum,\nbuckwheat, bean, grams, taro, yam and a vast range of wild fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. In one study carried out in two\nvillages of mid-hills in Nepal, Khanal et al. (2015) reported 52 indigenous crop species belonging to 27 families with their various uses.\nFarming communities continue to grow various indigenous crops, albeit in marginal land, because of their value on traditional food\nand associated culture. Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) has identified a list of indigenous crops based on their nutritional,\nmedicinal, cultural and other values.</td>

      <td>Many indigenous crops supply essential micronutrients to the human body, and need to be conserved in mountain food systems.\nFarmers in HKH region are cultivating and maintaining various indigenous crops such as Amaranthus, barley, black gram, horse gram,\nyam, and sesame. because of their nutritional value. Most of these indigenous crops are comparable with commercial cereals in terms\nof dietary energy and protein content, but are also rich in micronutrients. For example, pearl millet has higher content of calcium, iron,\nzinc, riboflavin and folic acid than rice or maize (Adhikari et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>NUS can provide both climate resilience and more options for dietary diversity to the farming communities of mountain ecosystems. Some\nof these indigenous crops have high medical importance. For example, mountain people in the HKH region have been using jammun\n(i.e., Syzygium cumini) to treat diabetes. In the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan, realising the importance of sea-buckthorn for\nnutritional and medicinal purposes, local communities have expanded its cultivation to larger areas. Many of these crops can be\ncultivated in marginal and/or fallow land which otherwise remains fallow. Most of these species are drought resistant and can\nbe easily grown in rainfed conditions in non-irrigated land.</td>
