The cardinal principle of CBDR+RC can be operationalized most effectively through the global application of PPP through carbon pricing, factoring in historical responsibility for causing the problem (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>; Seo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2013</xref>). The PPP is also practiced in several developing countries, such as Taiwan, Chile, and South Africa (Luppi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>). It has both efficiency and equity elements, deserving global adoption (Nash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2000</xref>). The non-internalization of externalities by major emitters at this point in our knowledge about the causes of climate change is genuine free-riding (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>).</p>
