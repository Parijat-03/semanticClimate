From a microeconomic perspective, one piece of research (no. 5) used the total cost of ownership approach (TCO) to examine the specific effectiveness of the level of CO<sub>2</sub> pricing proposed in the policy package. A law study no. 6 focussed on legal framework settings, and the potential and constraints for CO<sub>2</sub> pricing implementation in Germany. A macroeconomic simulation study (no. 7) used the energy system model REMod in order to show the total avoidance costs arising in comparison with a business-as-usual scenario. As a target setting, the simulation was based on a total reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 55% by 2030 and deduced an adequate level of CO<sub>2</sub> price to meet the reduction goal. In an agent-based model approach, study no. 8 depicted possible changes in mobility behaviour and mobility demand due to the increase in the cost of motorized private transport (MPT) via a CO<sub>2</sub> price component.</p>
