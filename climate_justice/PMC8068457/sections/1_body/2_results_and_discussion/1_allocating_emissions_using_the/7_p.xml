This group should address its immediate future with very drastic emissions reductions. Fortunately, these countries have been implementing GHG emissions reduction policies. These policies have led to a gradual reduction of the historical responsibility per capita. The GHG emissions per capita, which in 1994 were 8.85 tCO<sub>2eq</sub>, had already been reduced down to 7.36 tCO<sub>2eq</sub> by the end of 2017. In Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, these details will be discussed.</p>
