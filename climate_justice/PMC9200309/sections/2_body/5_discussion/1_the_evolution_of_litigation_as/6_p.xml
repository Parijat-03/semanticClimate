<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The total rise in cases is due largely to the recently documented increases in annual litigation occurring in the US and in a select few other jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Spain, and the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, litigation may indicate that there are political, cultural or other obstacles to climate justice in a particular jurisdiction. In <italic toggle="yes">Juliana v United States</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 7), despite a 38-page submission by leading public health experts stating that &#8220;without significant intervention, this new era will come to define the health of an entire generation&#8221;, the court declined to directly adjudicate on climate change. The court explained the adjudication did not refute the science, rather recoiled from passing a political ruling in the following statement: &#8220;There is no justiciable &#8216;controversy&#8217; when parties seek adjudication of a political question&#8230; It is not the province of the judiciary to make the policy decisions required to grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek. Nor may this Court direct other branches of government to overhaul their fossil fuel, agriculture, logging, and family planning policies to address climate change. To suggest otherwise is to overlook &#8216;the separate and distinct constitutional role&#8217; of the judiciary&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This ruling may yet be overturned on appeal, but the judges of this case interpreted the constitution so as to hold that climate policy must arise from the legislative and political process, and not the judiciary.</p>
