But what his book conspicuously does not do is question the underlying issue of consumer capitalism and its environmental impact. What the book advocates is using the current systems of governance and tweaking them so that they encourage society to decarbonise. It is a book aimed at an American audience to show the scale of the problem but, more fundamentally, to reassure them, there are solutions existing or coming soon which will help avoid the worst of climate change. And yet, this is at odds with the opening and central message of the book, which is we have to go from emitting 51 million tons of carbon emissions per year to zero in less than 30&#160;years. This needs a revolution in our production of energy and food, and in our transport systems, and our built environment. It also needs us to consume less of the planet&#8217;s valuable and finite resources. We need to radically change our excessive consumption&#8212;because we cannot continue as we are, and we certainly cannot in 2050 have 10 billion people with the same consumption habits of an average person in the developed world today. It is the acceptance of the need for this radical change that is so essential if we are to tackle climate change but which is missing from Bill Gates&#8217;s book.</p>
