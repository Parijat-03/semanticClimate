Here I delve into how the IPCC has helped enact three scientific metaphors&#8212;temperature threshold, carbon budget and climate deadline&#8212;all of which anchor the story of climate change to an index of global temperature. I chose these metaphors because they have become part of the general lexicon on climate change. It is also because the IPCC presented them with iconic visual images. Visual images carry symbolic messages that can transcend linguistic barriers, shaping the cultural discourse of climate change (O&#8217;Neill and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>). The graphics in IPCC reports are particularly powerful rhetorical devices since they are with the 'scientific veneer' of legitimacy (McMahon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>).</p>
