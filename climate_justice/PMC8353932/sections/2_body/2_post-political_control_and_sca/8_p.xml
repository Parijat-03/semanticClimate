This is because physical limits make us feel that we have (too) little space or time to do everything&#8212;choosing one thing means not choosing something else. This trade-off thinking is evident in the framing of a zero-sum choice, by using the carbon budget concept, in fossil fuel divestment campaigns (Strauch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Divestment activists often argue that climate policy is about the choice of two incompatible futures: either a carbon-constrained world or a fossil-fuel development world.</p>
