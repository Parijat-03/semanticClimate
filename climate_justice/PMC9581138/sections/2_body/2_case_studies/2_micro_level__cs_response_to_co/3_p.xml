<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Content analysis of projects' websites revealed projects focused on three main domains, namely tracking the spread of the pandemic in the population, investigating the influence of COVID-19 on people's wellbeing, and investigating the COVID-19 virus biology (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Citizen scientists' tasks centered around responding to an online survey, self-tracking data from a wearable device and distributed computing. Overall projects were widely accessible, targeting a broad audience, and requiring no special skills. Most projects required at least a moderate degree of effort from participants, asking a few types of questions, and many required frequent contributions at regular intervals.</p>
