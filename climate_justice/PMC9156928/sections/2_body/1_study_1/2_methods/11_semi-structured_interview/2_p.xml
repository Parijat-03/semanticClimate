<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Following the confirmatory analyses, we conducted semi-structured interviews within two months from the end of the study (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">f</italic>) [<xref rid="RSOS210006C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This was initially planned to gain a more nuanced understanding of how participants experienced the psychological factors that emerged as the best predictors of activism behaviour. Due to the lack of activism behaviour, these interviews were used to understand what held back the participants from engaging in the online events. The semi-structured interviews also explored participants' subjective beliefs about what caused any increase in the psychological factors from pre- to post-intervention. With these general aims in mind, and learning from each participant's quantitative results, we tailored an interview script. Possible questions could relate to changes or lack of change from baseline to follow-up, as well as the lack of engagement in climate action. An example script is shown in the electronic supplementary materials.</p>
