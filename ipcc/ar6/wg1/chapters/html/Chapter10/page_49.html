Despite its wide use, bias adjustment was not assessed in AR5 (Flato et&#160;al., 2014). Several problems have been identified that may arise from an uncritical use of bias adjustment, and that may result in misleading impact assessments. The rationale of this Cross-Chapter Box is to provide an overview of the use of bias adjustment in this Report, and to assess key limitations of the approach.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.11" top="570.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="570.6" x1="549.11" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.8; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Bias-adjusted climate model output is used extensively throughout this Report. Several results from Chapter&#160;8, and many of the climatic impact-drivers in Chapter&#160;12 (Section&#160;12.2) are based on bias adjustment. The Atlas presents many results both as raw and bias-adjusted data (Atlas.1.4.5). The application of bias adjustment in the WGI report was informed by the assessment in Chapter&#160;10 and this Cross-Chapter Box. Finally, bias adjustment is crucial for many studies assessed in the WGII report. An overview of bias adjustment can be found in Section&#160;10.3.1.3, a&#160;general performance assessment of individual method classes in Section&#160;10.3.3.7. The&#160;fitness of bias adjustment for climate change applications is assessed in Section&#160;10.3.3.9.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="194.07" top="486.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.43; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="486.48" x1="194.07">Relevance of bias adjustment</span><span x0="70.87" y0="474.6" x1="549.11" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.32; y0: 474.6; y1: 484.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An argument made for the use of bias adjustment is the fact that impact models are commonly very sensitive, often non-linearly, to the input climatic variables and their biases, in particular when threshold-based climate indices are required (Dosio, 2016). There are, however, cases where bias adjustment may not be necessary or useful, such as: when only qualitative statements are required; when only changes in mean climate are considered (instead of absolute values); when percentile-based indices are used.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="245.05" top="414.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 79.02; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 8.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="414.48" x1="245.05">Modification of the climate change signal</span><span x0="70.87" y0="402.6" x1="549.11" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.8; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Bias adjustment methods like quantile mapping can modify simulated climate trends, with impacts on changes to climate indices, in particular, extremes (Haerter et&#160;al., 2011; Dosio et&#160;al., 2012; Ahmed et&#160;al., 2013; Hempel et&#160;al., 2013; Maurer and Pierce, 2014; Cannon et&#160;al., 2015; Dosio, 2016; Casanueva et&#160;al., 2020). Some argue that these trend modifications are implicit corrections of state-dependent biases (Boberg and Christensen, 2012; Gobiet et&#160;al., 2015). However, others argue that the modification is generally invalid because the modification is linked to the representation of day-to-day rather than long-term variability (Pierce et&#160;al., 2015; Maraun et&#160;al., 2017); a&#160;given temperature value does not necessarily belong to the same weather state in present and future climate (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017); the modification affects the models climate sensitivity (Hempel et&#160;al., 2013); and is affected by random internal climate variability (Switanek et&#160;al., 2017). Thus, trend preserving quantile mapping methods have been developed (Section&#160;10.3.1.3.2), although some authors found no clear advantage of these methods (Maurer and Pierce, 2014). Further research is required to fully understand the validity of trend modifications by quantile-mapping.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="337.92" top="270.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.43; y0: 270.48; y1: 280.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="270.48" x1="337.92">Bias adjustment in the presence of large-scale circulation errors</span><span x0="70.87" y0="258.6" x1="549.12" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The large-scale circulation has a&#160;strong impact on regional climate, thus circulation errors will cause regional climate biases (Section&#160;10.3.3.3). As bias adjustment in general does not account for circulation errors, it is therefore important to understand the&#160;impact of these errors on the outcome of the bias adjustment (Addor et&#160;al., 2016; Photiadou et&#160;al., 2016; Maraun et&#160;al., 2017). If&#160;the frequency of precipitation-relevant weather types is biased, a&#160;standard bias adjustment (not accounting for this frequency bias) would remove the overall climatological bias, but the precipitation falling in a&#160;given weather type could still be substantially biased (Addor et&#160;al., 2016). Adjusting the number of wet days can artificially deteriorate the spell-length distribution (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017). In&#160;the presence of location biases of circulation patterns, bias adjustment may introduce physically implausible solutions (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017). Bias adjusting the location of circulation features (Levy&#160;et&#160;al., 2013) may introduce inconsistencies with the model orography, land&#8211;sea contrasts, and SSTs (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="102.06" top="150.6"><span x0="70.87" y0="150.6" x1="102.06" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 103.38; x1: 110.24; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="103.38" y0="150.6" x1="177.34">medium confidence </span><span x0="178.66" y0="150.6" x1="549.09" style="x0: 178.66; x1: 181.47; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that the selection of climate models with low biases in the frequency, persistence and location of large-scale atmospheric circulation can reduce negative impacts of bias adjustment.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="276.9" top="114.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.98; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="114.48" x1="276.9">Using bias adjustment for statistical downscaling</span><span x0="70.87" y0="102.6" x1="549.09" style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.8; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Bias adjustment is often used to downscale climate model results from grid box data to finer resolution or point scale. It is sometimes even directly applied to coarse-resolution global model output to avoid an intermediate dynamical downscaling step (Johnson and Sharma, 2012; Stoner et&#160;al., 2013). But bias adjustment does not add any information about the processes acting on unresolved scales and is therefore by construction not capable of bridging substantial scale gaps (Maraun, 2013a; Maraun et&#160;al., 2017).
