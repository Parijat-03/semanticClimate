![[fig2_13.png]]Figure 2.13 Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions by major economic sector and their underlying trends by region



Panel a: Trends in total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions (in GtCO2eq yr-1) by major economic sector. 

Panel b: Trends in total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions (in GtCO2eq yr-1) by major economic sector and region. 

Panels c and d: Largest sub-sectoral changes in GHG emissions for the 6 reporting period 2010-2019 in relative (% annual change) and absolute terms (GtCO2eq yr-1). Emissions are converted into CO2-equivalents based on global warming potentials with a 100 year time horizon (GWP-100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.
