<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Heat exposure was estimated using the urban heat risk index (UHRI), a composite index of biophysical factors related to urban heat. The UHRI was calculated using the equation: <italic>UHRI = [LST (z score) + NDBI (z score)] &#8722; NDVI (z score)</italic> [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. LST (land surface temperature) was calculated from thermal data (band 6) utilizing the mono-window algorithm that is based on the thermal transference equation [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. NDBI (normalized difference built-up index) measured impervious surface coverage, while vegetation abundance, indicative of greenspace, was assessed by calculating the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). LST as well as landscape factors of impervious surface coverage and vegetation abundance are strongly correlated with the urban heat island [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The UHRI thus takes all three into account as an indication of the spatial extent and intensity of the urban heat island [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
