<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0120">While there is a broad consensus that knowledge for adaptation and other sustainability challenges needs to be co-produced, we inquire whether there also is a trend towards a more activist role for researchers, in line with Sen and others&#8217; call for informed agitation (<xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Sen, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 2020</xref>). The demands on sustainability researchers are significant, if we are to believe <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava and colleagues (2020)</xref>: &#8220;In a world beset with grand challenges, scientists must also become translators of knowledge, communicators to the public, policymakers, implementors of action, advocates of solutions, and co-designers of the future&#8221; (2020: 336). Similar calls are found in other articles, arguing that the challenges of the Anthropocene require a transformation of science itself towards more collaborative, open, and egalitarian approaches (e.g., <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Fazey et al., 2020</xref>). As mentioned above, there is a continuum from applied, problem-driven research where co-production efforts consist of facilitating consultation with stakeholders in a workshop &#8211; to interventionist action research where the processes of co-production also include explicit goals of changes in systems and practices (e.g <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Mach et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In the corpus reviewed for this article, 16 out of 51 articles described various types of interventionist co-production processes that either aimed at instigating system change or implemented it. Below, we outline findings from four of these: The first article outlines how intervention from a project helped foster more inclusive local governance models in South Africa, where city officials, local community stakeholders, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), representatives, and researchers collaborated in developing local adaptation plans (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziervogel, 2019</xref>). Another method for co-production for adaptation with an interventionist potential is through science dialogue platforms. In the second article, these have been found to be able to deliver solutions that later become institutionalized through development plans in Ghana, Senegal, and Mali for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) (Zougmore et al., 2017). Agricultural research and extension services is a field with a long history of intervention research and co-production. Networks for CSA, which established collaborations between farmers and researchers in several countries in Asia, have served to both adapt agricultural practices to climate change and to increase overall sustainability (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Hellin et al., 2020</xref>). The fourth article is the only one in the corpus that presents a participatory action research approach to adaptation. It suggests a participatory action research approach for SDG 13, targeted at undergraduates in higher education (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Trott et al., 2018</xref>). The article concludes that participatory action research represents a pathway for SDG realization by fostering boundary-spanning scholars that can transform higher education institutions to better serve the wellbeing of local communities (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Trott et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
