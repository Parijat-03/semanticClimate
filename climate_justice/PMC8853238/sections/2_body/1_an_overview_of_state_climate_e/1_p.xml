In the U.S., states have led in this area since the early 2000s as detailed in scholarly work (e.g., Rabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2004</xref>; Matisoff and Edwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2014</xref>; Bromley-Trujillo and Holman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>).</p>
