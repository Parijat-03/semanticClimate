<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A Community of Practice Opt-In Directory was offered to all participants in week
3 of the CCHH ECHO. Participants were given the opportunity to stay connected
with fellow participants after the CCHH ECHO session by filling out a
confidential survey listing their name, email address, and optional cellular
telephone number. During the last week of the CCHH ECHO, 55 participants (8% of
625 unique participants) who signed up for this directory were sent information
to their ECHO classmates as a method to connect with one another after the
course.</p>
