For many, the role of this court was felt to be a clear abuse of process. A comment written underneath the above article conveyed one of the central frustrations: <italic>&#8220;Just wondering if anyone has had a chance to ask the judge how else is anyone able to register their objections to this whole fiasco and be acknowledged if he (the judge) has refused to entertain any background &#8211; any environmental concerns, ethics, etc. Don't forget, every other avenue of communicating one's objections has been shut down, which is why people are doing all these &#8216;unlawful&#8217; actions in the first place.&#8221;</italic> Another comment came in the form of reinforcing solidarity: <italic>&#8220;I am grateful to all the people who have been willing to stand up to the lies, bullying, and manipulations of the state. Civil disobedience is a basic necessity of a democracy. This movement is spreading, as more people realize what the situation truly is. Protection of our basic rights to clean water and soil is at the heart of our survival.&#8221;</italic> At this point, amid rushed NEB hearings for the pipeline's permitting, many were unsure of what resistance possibilities remained. Although a victory had just been achieved in the United States with regulators blocking the Keystone Pipeline (NRDC, 2018), the NEB in Canada was speedily granting permission for TMX construction, and just the week prior declared that it approved more than 72 per cent of the route (Calgary <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Herald, 2018</xref>).</p>
