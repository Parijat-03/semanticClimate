way models were presented and visualized. For example, one of the comments
criticized the aesthetics of a graphical plot displaying multiple line charts in
a single chart, the commenter wrote: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t understand these charts.
I&#8217;m confused as to where each one starts.&#8221; In another example, a commenter also
criticized the visualizations for being too difficult to interpret, the
commenter wrote: &#8220;More clarity would be nice, I&#8217;m a science guy and I struggled
to understand what was being shown.&#8221;</p>
