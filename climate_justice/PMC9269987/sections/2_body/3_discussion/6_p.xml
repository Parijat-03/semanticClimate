Indeed, in our study, moral disengagement in high carbon behavior had remarkable predictive power. According to the theory of moral disengagement (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 2016</xref>), emotional distress (an aversive negative affective state) is unpleasant to endure. As a result, individuals rather change their argumentation (via justifications) than their behavior. Therefore, a focus on negative emotions may lead to increasing moral disengagement instead of a behavioral change. That is why <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al. (2017)</xref> recommended that a nuanced and authentic approach is necessary when emotions are used to target pro-environmental behavior change. However, we state that outlining means of behavior change, rather than just pointing out what is being done wrong, induces anticipated pride. Both authentic and hubristic pride withstood a backward elimination as predictors of pro-environmental intention, and, therefore, should be considered in attempts to change behavior. This is also in line with the literature on the positive effects of pride on pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Bissing-Olson et al., 2016</xref>). Notwithstanding, the effect of pride is not consistent but rather depends on the context (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Hurst and Sintov, 2022</xref>), which again supports the necessity of careful use of emotions in pro-environmental behavior change.</p>
