Internet inequity refers to differential access to the internet based on the wealth of a country (high-, low-, or middle-income), geographic region (urban, rural, or remote), and socioeconomic status, gender, age, or ethnicity of the citizens [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Rural and remote communities facing barriers to internet connectivity are arguably the most adversely impacted by climate change and food insecurity, so it is important to consider whom we may be leaving out by going digital. The digital divide is a complex phenomenon; however, countries such as Canada are pledging resources to enable equitable access to rural and remote areas [<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>-<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Although it is beyond the scope of this project to address these systemic issues, we are working with policymakers and communities as part of the Smart Platform to improve internet access for citizens. For example, we are providing smartphones and data plans to enable citizen participation and working with local community organizations to provide venues for free Wi-Fi access.</p>
