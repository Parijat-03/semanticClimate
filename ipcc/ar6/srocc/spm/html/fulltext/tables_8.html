RCPs are scenarios that include time series of emissions\nand concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as\nland use / land cover. RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of\nglobal warming. {Annex I: Glossary}</td>

      <td>This report uses mainly RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in its assessment, reflecting the available literature. RCP2.6 represents\na low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of\nlimiting global warming to below 2&#186;C by 210015. By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario\nin the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric\ngreenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the\nhighest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and\nRCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming.\n{Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}</td>
