When these students were asked how much they thought climate change would harm them personally, their most common response was &#8220;a moderate amount&#8221; (chosen by 43%) at the beginning of the semester, as compared to &#8220;a great deal&#8221; (chosen by 41%) at the end of the semester. Such a shift makes sense, considering that another instructional emphasis of the course was that climate change is linked to human health. In lecture, students were presented with this quotation from an editorial in a prominent medical journal: &#8220;Today, in the early part of the 21st century, it is critical to recognize that climate change poses the same threat to health as the lack of sanitation, clean water, and pollution did in the early 20th century&#8221; (Bauchner &amp; Fontanarosa, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, p. 1519). Students were also presented with information on the myriad ways that climate change impacts human health, including via more frequent extreme heat and ozone exceedance days, increased vector&#8208;borne diseases, greater food insecurity, and more natural disasters (Patz, Frumkin, Holloway, Vimont, &amp; Haines, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Given this content, students would have had ample cause to leave the course feeling that they were more likely to be personally harmed by a changing climate.</p>
