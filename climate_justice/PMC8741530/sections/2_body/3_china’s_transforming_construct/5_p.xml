Different from the pure self-centred and unilateral leadership, China&#8217;s conceptions of a shared leadership particularly emphasize that international actors co-define international rules and co-govern global affairs through consensus-making, jointly promote the reform of the multilateral order of global governance and build a community of common destiny for mankind. Additionally, China&#8217;s <italic>yinlingzhe</italic> style, which is partially in line with Robyn Eckersley&#8217;s account of leadership, approaches leadership as a form of social interaction whereby leading states guide, attract or negotiate &#8216;the consent or acquiescence of other parties&#8217;, &#8216;enable or facilitate collective action towards the achievement of a common purpose in a given community&#8217; (Eckersley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>: 1184). In this article, I coin this new <italic>yinlingzhe</italic> representation as a new Yinling Leading Power identity. It should be noted that this Yinling Leading Power identity is an ideal-type. From a constructivist perspective, the ultimate result of this new identity construction heavily relies on the recognition of other international actors.</p>
