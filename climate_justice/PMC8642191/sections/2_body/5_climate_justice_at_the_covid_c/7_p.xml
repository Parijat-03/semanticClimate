Influential officials have called for more &#8216;green stimulus&#8217; (e.g. GFLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) but without apparent success. Instead, the steel and cement industries reported higher growth in 2020 than in 2019, reflecting a fossil fuel-intensive response to pandemic disruption (Du, Jia and Wei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>). The challenge is particularly acute in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> because its &#8216;green finance&#8217; framework is focused heavily on debt (credit and bonds), for which demand has &#8216;significantly decreased&#8217; as part of a general credit market contraction (UNEP Inquiry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>, 8). There have been some examples of &#8216;green&#8217; stimulus, including the launch of a $12 billion Green Development Fund. Investment in &#8216;building renovation for older people&#8217;, including energy efficiency improvements (Vivid Economics/F4B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021b</xref>, 40), could be considered a climate justice measure.</p>
