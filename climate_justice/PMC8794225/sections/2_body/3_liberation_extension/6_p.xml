These should be replaced with a commitment to care work, mutual aid, and improving the material conditions of the growing underclass (Spade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2020</xref>), prioritizing collective well-being over individualist, entrepreneurial skills training. Relatedly, a commitment to overcoming interlocking forms of oppression could infuse Extension programming, materials, and pedagogy at multiple levels. Extension should be antiracist and feminist, prioritizing efforts to undo structures of racism and sexism that persist through neutrality and inaction, beginning with their own programs. My point is not that Extension should wave a flag to loudly advocate for radical change, which would not accomplish much and may not resonate with diverse publics. But it should prioritize the material needs, collective orientations, and organizational capacities of working communities and seek opportunities to creatively engage them in the processes of addressing the structural roots of their problems through co-imagining and co-constructing democratic and sustainable systems. Grounding Extension in civilizational challenges could expand shrinking constituencies (Colasanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>; Coppess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>), including in rural areas.</p>
