Using BootCat again, we identified and scraped relevant webpages from the websites of eight of the UK&#8217;s largest supermarkets, with varying degrees of success: Co-op, Ocado, M&amp;S, Asda, Sainsbury&#8217;s, Morrisons, Tesco, and Waitrose. The tuples used to gather this data are listed in <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_app_001" ref-type="app">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
