According to IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) data, between 1990 and 2017, the consumption of biofuels and waste rose from 3253 to 4237 ktoe. The increase in biofuels and waste consumption was calculated to be 30.2% for this period. Although coal is the main source of Australia&#8217;s electricity generation, its share of the total energy consumption is less than oil, natural gas, and biofuels and waste. Australia&#8217;s coal production increased, whereas its consumption decreased during the reviewed period. Hence, the country became the world&#8217;s largest coal exporter and the share of coal revenues in total GDP was significantly high (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Coal consumption in total energy consumption declined by 44.7% from 4558 to 2521 ktoe over the period 1990&#8211;2017 (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The importers of Australian coal include Japan, China, South Korea, India, and Taiwan. According to an EIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) report, these nations accounted for 33%, 19%, 13%, 12%, and 9% of Australia&#8217;s coal exports in 2016, respectively.</p>
