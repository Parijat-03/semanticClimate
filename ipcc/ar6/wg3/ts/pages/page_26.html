There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing&#160;development pathways will not achieve rapid and deep emission reductions. In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments may not be able to limit global emissions to a&#160;degree sufficient to meet ambitious mitigation goals or they may only be able to do so at very high economic and social costs. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.46" top="570.61"><span x0="65.2" y0="570.61" x1="543.46" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 570.61; y1: 580.11; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Policies to shift development pathways, on the other hand, make mitigation policies more effective. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between sustainable development objectives and mitigation.

For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained. These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air, and benefits from enhanced mobility {8.2, 8.4, 4.4.1}. Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also deliver significant health benefits. {9.8.1 and 9.8.2}</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.39" top="426.63"><span x0="65.2" y0="426.63" x1="543.39" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 426.63; y1: 436.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">However, decisions about mitigation actions, and their timing and scale, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in the near, mid- and long term {Chapter&#160;12}. In the near term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low-income residents outside the city {8.2.2}. In the mid- and long term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation {3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2, 12.5.3}. Prioritising is one way to manage these trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability (SDPS) as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives and accelerate mitigation.

Such choices would not be marginal, but include technological, systemic and socio-behavioural changes {4.4}. Decision points also arise with new infrastructure, sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence-based and integrated decision-making, financial alignment towards low-carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from fossil fuel consumption. Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes. {4.4, Cross-Chapter Box&#160;5 in Chapter&#160;4} </span></div><div left="65.2" right="255.64" top="198.48"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.31; y0: 198.48; y1: 208.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="198.48" x1="255.64">How can development pathways be &#8216;shifted&#8217;?</span><span x0="65.2" y0="186.6" x1="543.44" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Shifting development paths is complex. Changes that involve &#8216;dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components&#8217; take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning, even when they promise large gains. Despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector, and social stakeholders. Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-up changes in public opinion. Collective action by individuals as part of social movements or lifestyle changes underpins system change. {5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5}</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.4" top="102.61"><span x0="65.2" y0="102.61" x1="543.4" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 102.61; y1: 112.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Sectoral transitions that aim to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives and deploy a&#160;diverse mix of policies and institutional measures.
