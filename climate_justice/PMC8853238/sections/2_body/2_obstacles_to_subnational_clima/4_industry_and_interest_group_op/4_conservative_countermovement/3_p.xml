Parts of the movement organize campaigns to create uncertainty around climate modeling, methodology, and the integrity of scientists themselves (Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2014</xref>). One of the first such climate denial think tanks was the George C. Marshall Institute (Oreskes and Conway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2008</xref>). Others include the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Heartland Institute. Conservative think tanks and foundations brand themselves as an alternative universe of scientists outside of academia. They publish policy briefs, books, and analyses that question the credibility of climate science (McCright and Dunlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2015</xref>).</p>
