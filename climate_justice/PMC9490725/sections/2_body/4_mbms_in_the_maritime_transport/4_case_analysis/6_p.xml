<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par54">The work of Sandel and others on market ethics relates to the negative outcomes of MBMs when in use, but previous authors have not considered how existing MBMs or even previous proposals for MBMs can influence succeeding policy discussions and render alternatives invisible. The maritime case demonstrates that the fairness and corruption objections were identified not only in the way that MBMs would work if they were applied, but also in the ongoing policy process. If they were applied they would have weak outcomes, thus evidencing the fairness objection, and crowd out non-market norms by focusing on efficiency and reducing urgency, thus reflecting the corruption objection. In the policy process, the fairness objection is seen in how policy is still based on efficiency rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels, and the corruption objection can be observed in the crowding out of alternatives for discussion.</p>
