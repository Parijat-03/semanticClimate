In our data, the chronic exposure to particulate matter was associated with COVID-19 incidence but not mortality rate. Previous studies, such as Wu&#8217;s article on counties from the United States, revealed that the risk of dying from COVID-19 increased by 8% for each additional unit of PM<sub>2.5</sub> [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; in Coke&#8217;s study conducted in northern Italian communes, the risk increased by 9% [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; and in Cole&#8217;s study in the Netherlands, for each unit increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 2.3 more deaths were recorded [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our crude models, we found an association between chronic exposures to particulate matter, coarse and fine, and mortality rate. However, after adjusting by other covariates, this association was no longer statistically significant. We hypothesize that a greater number of communes is required to improve the statistical power to be able to confirm these results. Furthermore, the average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> in this study were slightly lower than in the previously mentioned studies, which could potentially explain our differences.</p>
