(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>) provided a decomposition analysis for Australia&#8217;s total and per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the period 1978&#8211;2010 by adopting the LMDI method. Their findings indicated that the energy efficiency and structural changes in the country&#8217;s economy lead to a modest decline in Australia&#8217;s total emissions. The authors also reported that Australia&#8217;s efforts to mitigate emissions should be remarkably higher in 2010&#8211;2020 period as compared to the 2005&#8211;2010 period.</p>
