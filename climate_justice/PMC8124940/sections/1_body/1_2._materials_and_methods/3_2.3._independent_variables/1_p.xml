<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The independent variables utilized in our study represented three categories of social vulnerability: (i) socio-demographic vulnerability, denoted by children, caste, and family size; (ii) housing-related vulnerability, denoted by household access to assets, electricity, and home ownership; and (iii) employment-related vulnerability, denoted by literacy and involvement in agriculture. All of these independent variables are variables of interest since they measure unique aspects of social vulnerability. In addition, population density was used as a control variable. Since our study was mainly exploratory, it was expected that statistical analysis would reveal the significance of these variables to understanding social vulnerability with respect to the spatial distribution of heat and greenspace in Delhi.</p>
