In the forest 7 areas of the subregion, both positive and negative effects of climate change have been observed recently.  8 There has been an increase in forest productivity in most of boreal Siberia due to the extension of the 9 vegetation period. At the same time, there has been a decrease in forest productivity due to increased risk of 10 wildfire, natural disturbances and tree mortality caused by migrating insects and other tree diseases (SRCCL; 11 IPCC, 2019a). 12 13 14 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.4; y0: 595.67; y1: 606.65; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="595.67" x1="254.96">Previous findings from IPCC assessments </span><span x0="27.66" y0="595.67" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 595.67; y1: 606.65; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">15 16 In the previous IPCC assessment cycles three subregions defined in the current AR6 as North Asia merged 17 with East Europe and partly Arctic subregions and were considered as either Northern Eurasia, or Russia in 18 AR4/AR5. Analysis of North Asia together with Arctic is appropriate particularly for river discharge since 19 the main rivers of Arctic drainage flow over West and East Siberia.  20 21 In WGI AR5 (IPCC, 2013b) for the Arctic drainage areas, it was found that upward trends in streamflow 22 were not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available observations. 23 Observation data are known to be sparse and exhibit large cold-season biases in the Arctic drainage areas 24 and hence there are large uncertainties in using these datasets to investigate the influence of precipitation on 25 streamflow. Surface water area reduction has been observed in discontinuous permafrost of central and 26 southern Siberia. Increased evaporation from warmer/longer summers, decreased recharge due to reductions 27 in snow melt volume, and dynamic processes such as ice-jam flooding are important considerations for 28 understanding observed surface water area change across the Arctic (SROCC). In AR5 WGII, although the 29 most evident flood trends appear to be in northern high latitudes, where observed warming trends have been 30 largest, in some regions no evidence of a trend in extreme flooding has been found, e.g. over Russia, based 31 on daily river discharge. Other studies for Asia show varying trends in the magnitude and frequency of 32 floods and there is currently no clear and widespread evidence for observed changes in flooding except for 33 earlier spring flows in snow-dominated regions. 34 35 SROCC has concluded that boreal forest vegetation shows trends of both greening and browning over 36 multiple years in different regions in satellite records (</span><span style="x0: 296.22; x1: 301.71; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="296.22" y0="317.45" x1="366.12">high confidence</span><span x0="366.12" y0="317.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 366.12; x1: 369.78; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). Here, patterns of changing 37 vegetation are a result of direct responses to changes in climate (temperature, precipitation and seasonality) 38 and other driving factors for vegetation (nutrients, disturbance) similar to what has been reported in tundra. 39 While boreal forest may expand at the northern edge, climate projections suggest that it could diminish at the 40 southern edge and be replaced by lower biomass woodland/shrublands (</span><span style="x0: 373.44; x1: 381.37; y0: 266.81; y1: 277.79; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="373.44" y0="266.81" x1="458.69">medium confidence</span><span x0="458.7" y0="266.81" x1="41.44" style="x0: 458.7; x1: 462.36; y0: 266.81; y1: 277.79; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). Furthermore, 41 changes in fire disturbance are leading to shifts in landscape distribution of early and late successional 42 ecosystem types. Fires that burn deeply into the organic soil layer can alter permafrost stability, hydrology 43 and vegetation. Loss of the soil organic layer exposes mineral soil seedbeds, leading to recruitment of 44 deciduous tree and shrub species that do not establish on organic soil. This recruitment has been shown to 45 shift post-fire vegetation to alternate successional trajectories of increasing deciduous forest at the expense of 46 evergreen forest in Russian boreal forests (</span><span style="x0: 245.4; x1: 253.33; y0: 190.91; y1: 201.89; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="245.4" y0="190.91" x1="330.66">medium confidence</span><span x0="330.66" y0="190.91" x1="41.44" style="x0: 330.66; x1: 334.32; y0: 190.91; y1: 201.89; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). 47 48 In WGI AR5, North Asia is considered together with Central Asia in the regional chapter (Christensen et al., 49 2013). The CMIP5 models generally have difficulties in representing climatological means of both 50 temperature and precipitation for the sub-regions represented in this area, which is partly related to the 51 coarse resolution that is not able to resolve the complex mountainous terrain on the south border of the 52 region. But the scarceness of observational data in northern parts of the region and issues related to 53 estimation of biases with coarse resolution models add to the uncertainty in the model results (Christensen et 54 al., 2013).  55 </span></div></body></html>
