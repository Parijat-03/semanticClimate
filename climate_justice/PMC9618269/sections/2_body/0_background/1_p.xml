The same can be said for climate change. Globally, lockdowns were instituted at the outset to curtail the spread of the disease. Consequently, the closure of businesses and public facilities translates to economic grounding which invariably takes a toll on people&#8212;strangulating livelihoods. This action put the entire society at risk&#8212;socially and economically. But the risk to people and communities varies. Thus, lockdown or quarantine for some is a luxury (they can afford it), whilst for others it is a hardship or solitary confinement. In essence, this laid bare the challenges of sustainable and inclusive development across Nigeria&#8217;s public infrastructure, economy, and society.</p>
