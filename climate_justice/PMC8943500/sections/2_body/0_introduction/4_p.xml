As an expression of political willpower, the <italic>Agenda 2030</italic>, is encouraging, but the implementation of this ambitious policy has been slow and is yet to be realised. In fact, the planetary situation has rather deteriorated since 2017, when <italic>the World Scientists&#180; Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice</italic> was published (Ripple et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). In 2018, this message was reinforced by Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists stated that we were already facing a &#8216;planetary emergency&#8217;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> The harsh facts are that we are currently transgressing several of the planetary boundaries that have been identified as a safe and just space for development (O&#180;Neill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). The <italic>Living Planet Report</italic> by Almond et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>) provides harsh facts about the loss of biological diversity, which indicates that Humanity&#8217;s relationship with nature is broken. Fresh data shows that global temperatures are continuing to rise with alarming speed (WMO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2022</xref>). There is no doubt that we must considerably ramp up our work for sustainability in order to protect the foundations for a good life on planet Earth.</p>
