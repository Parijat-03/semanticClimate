Transitions from natural to managed forest landscapes can involve a&#160;reduction in forest carbon stocks, the magnitude of which depends on the initial landscape conditions, the harvest rotation length relative to the frequency and intensity of natural disturbances, and on the age-dependence of managed and natural disturbances (Harmon et al. 1990; Kurz et al. 1998). Initial landscape conditions, in particular the age-class distribution and therefore carbon stocks of the landscape, strongly affect the mitigation potential of forest management options (Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2013; Kilpel&#228;inen et al. 2017). Landscapes with predominantly mature forests may experience larger reductions in carbon stocks during the transition to managed landscapes (Harmon et al. 1990; Kurz et al. 1998; Lewis et al. 2019). In landscapes with predominantly young or recently disturbed forests, SFM can enhance carbon stocks (Henttonen et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="75.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 75.57; y1: 85.07; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="75.57" x1="307.57">Forest growth rates, net primary productivity, and net ecosystem productivity are age-dependent, with maximum rates of COremoval </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="735.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.69; y0: 735.52; y1: 745.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.52" x1="566.1">(CDR) from the atmosphere occurring in young to medium-aged forests and declining thereafter (Tang et al. 2014). In boreal forest ecosystem, estimation of carbon stocks and carbon &#64258;uxes indicate that old growth stands are typically small carbon sinks or carbon sources (Gao et al. 2018; Taylor et al. 2014; Hadden and Grelle 2016). In tropical forests, carbon uptake rates in the &#64257;rst 20 years of forest recovery were 11 times higher than uptake rates in old-growth forests (Poorter et al. 2016).

Studies that ignore changes in forest carbon stocks (such as some lifecycle analyses that assume no impacts of harvest on forest carbon stocks), ignore changes in wood product pools (Mackey et al. 2013) or assume long-term steady state (Pingoud et al. 2018), or ignore changes in emissions from substitution bene&#64257;ts (Mackey et al. 2013; Lewis et al. 2019) will arrive at diverging conclusions about the bene&#64257;ts of SFM. Moreover, assessments of climate bene&#64257;ts of any mitigation action must also consider the time dynamics of atmospheric impacts, as some actions will have immediate bene&#64257;ts (e.g.,&#160;avoided deforestation), while others may not achieve net atmospheric bene&#64257;ts for decades or centuries. For example, the climate bene&#64257;ts of woody biomass use for bioenergy depend on several factors, such as the source and alternate fate of the biomass, the energy type it substitutes, and the rates of regrowth of the harvested forest (Lagani&#232;re et al. 2017; Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2014; Smyth et al. 2017). Conversion of primary forests in regions of very low stand-replacing disturbances to short-rotation plantations where the harvested wood is used for short-lived products with low displacement factors will increase emissions. In general, greater mitigation bene&#64257;ts are achieved if harvested wood products are used for products with long carbon retention time and high displacement factors. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="159.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.61; y0: 159.56; y1: 169.06; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="159.56" x1="566.1">With increasing forest age, carbon sinks in forests will diminish until harvest or natural disturbances, such as wild&#64257;re, remove biomass carbon or release it to the atmosphere (Seidl et al. 2017). While individual trees can accumulate carbon for centuries (K&#246;hl et al. 2017), stand-level carbon accumulation rates depend on both tree growth and tree mortality rates (Hember et al. 2016; Lewis et al. 2004). SFM, including harvest and forest regeneration, can help maintain active carbon sinks by maintaining a&#160;forest age-class distribution that includes a&#160;share of young, actively growing stands (Volkova et al. </span></div></body></html>
