<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Affective engagement had two subcategories: risk perception (questions such as &#8216;How likely do you think it is, from 1 to 7, that a) worldwide, many people's standard of living will decrease, b) worldwide water shortages will occur&#8230;.&#8217;) and emotional response (questions such as &#8216;When you think about a future impacted by climate change how much, from 1 to 7, of the following emotions do you feel? Guilt, Sadness, Fear, Shame&#8230;&#8217;). In the main analysis, risk perception and emotional response were collapsed into one composite score for affective engagement. In this <italic toggle="yes">post-hoc</italic> phase these items were analysed separately, which revealed that while risk perception changed from pre- to post-intervention (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.43), the emotional response did not (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 1, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.1). Additionally, the pre-post change for risk perception was greater than the pre-post change for emotional response (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>95</sub> = 3.00, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.003, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.3).</p>
