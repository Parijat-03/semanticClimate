BGC podcast listeners and followers on social media have been especially surprised by the history of erasure as it relates to the creation of US national parks. There has been great interest from followers on BGC&#8217;s Instagram account on how the &#8220;Fathers of Conservation,&#8221; mainly John Muir, Adam Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt, held racist beliefs toward Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, which resulted in their exclusion from natural spaces during and after the creation of the national park system (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2016</xref>). This topic has created a dialogue on BGC&#8217;s Instagram account that has included shock, denial, and in some cases anger because it challenges a history that was not part of the mainstream education system and narratives. Ultimately, this is one of the goals of the podcast&#8212;to undo and unlearn some of the harmful ways of knowing that have further racialized and minoritized DQTBIPOC. These BGC discussions were with Sarika Tandon, a racial equity and justice consultant (Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>, episode 30) and Francisco Valenzuela, a former director at the US Forest Service (Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>, episode 38) (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>BGC episodes that focused on the theme of access to nature and the outdoors</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Guest</th><th align="left">Episode</th><th align="left">Title of podcast episode</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Ambika Rajyagor</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>) Ep. 39</td><td align="left">Lending a Voice to Disability Justice and an Outdoors for All</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Francisco Valenzuela</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>) Ep. 38</td><td align="left">Recreating in Color: Promoting Ethnic Diversity in Public Lands</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Vasu Sojitra</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>) Ep. 35</td><td align="left">Ninjasticking Through the Woods to Bring Intersectionality to the Outdoors</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sarika Tandon</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>) Ep. 30</td><td align="left">Advocating for Racial Equity in the Environmental Movement</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Syren Nagakyrie</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>) Ep. 23</td><td align="left">Making the Outdoors Accessible to Disabled Hikers</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Dr. Olivia Aguilar</td><td align="left">(Mulki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>) Ep. 1</td><td align="left">A Journey Through Academia as a Woman of Color</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
