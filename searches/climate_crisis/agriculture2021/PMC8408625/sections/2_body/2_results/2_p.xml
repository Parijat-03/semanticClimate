As we can observe, WNV infections occur in regions with climates that can be described as &#8220;Hot-summer Mediterranean&#8221;, &#8220;Humid subtropical&#8221;, &#8220;Temperature oceanic&#8221; and &#8220;Warm-summer humid continental&#8221; or &#8220;Temperate oceanic&#8221;. <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the WNV infection incidence rates over the study period. From 2007 to 2009, very few regions were affected by WNV, however, 2010 saw an outbreak that spread far and wide. Since 2010, the number of regions that have been affected by WNV increased. In 2018, a massive outbreak affected almost all of the regions in our study.<fig id="fig0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of regional West Nile virus infections per 100,000 in humans from 2006 to 2019: (Data source: ECDC).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p>
