Indeed, during my observations in local meetings in early 2018, participants amiably discussed varying options for designing streetlamps, benches, or playground slides &#8211; deciding on the final touches of a plan that participants and the city largely agreed on. However, worries about gentrification became only one aspect of activists&#8217; many concerns after the city changed the plan in late 2018. In this first period of the project before 2018, the design phase, we have seen how the city&#8217;s plan was legitimate in the eyes of neighborhood residents. This legitimacy drew on participants&#8217; ability to see their <italic>influence</italic> in the plan, in other words, the plan was only legitimate because participants were able to recognize their own input incorporated into the evolution of the plan. Once the city changed plans and this influence from the public vanished, the city sought to recreate the legitimacy of the project in other ways, namely by appealing to the objectivity and rationality of civil engineering processes and the threat of future climate change impacts. However, the city&#8217;s rejection of the public plan tarnished the political reputation of government officials, which rendered their appeals to technical knowledge systems suspect in the eyes of participants, and ultimately failed to undo the legitimacy crisis that city officials had created for themselves.</p>
