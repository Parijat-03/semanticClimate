His ideas are considered by many as foundational for the discipline of ecological economics and degrowth alike (Asara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>; Vivien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2019</xref>), even if contemporary debates on degrowth, as I will show later, draw on a host of other disciplines and therefore extend beyond Georgescu-Roegen&#8217;s notion of bioeconomics. Georgescu-Roegen&#8217;s original concept of bioeconomics and the new idea of bioeconomy launched and promoted by the EU and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), despite the illusion of similarity in wording and despite the many existing visions related to the latter idea (Bugge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; P&#252;lzl, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>; Vivien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2019</xref>), can hardly be farther apart (Vivien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2019</xref> for details).</p>
