<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0305">The role of environmental and institutional components within SDGs related to financial inclusion is yet marginal. This fact also emerges in research and business (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho Ferreira et&#160;al., 2016</xref>). For instance, the integration into global value chains from the standpoint of environmental upgrading is not always interpreted as favourable (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Della Santa Navarrete et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). Also for this case, beneficial would be public sector stimulus and enforcement of environmental certifications and resource regulations to foster CSR and green entrepreneurship (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Drago and Gatto, 2022</xref>). Sustainability reporting can also contribute to meeting these objectives: carrying out voluntary disclosure of economic, environmental, social and governance information makes organisations more transparent and assists in involving the group's stakeholders (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Gir&#243;n et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). Through the mentioned procedures, the environment and the institutions are likely to improve hand-in-hand with the economy and the society, fulfilling the SDGs gap and helping to meet the stated targets.</p>
