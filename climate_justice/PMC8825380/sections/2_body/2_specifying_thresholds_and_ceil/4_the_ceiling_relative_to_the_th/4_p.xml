For example, consider the sharing of a resource that generates 100 units of something. What is needed for minimal level of capabilities is 25, and there are five agents. Assuming that there are no morally relevant differences between the five agents that would warrant an unequal distribution, there are (at least) two main distributive options consistent with justice:<table-wrap id="Tabb"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">1</th><th align="left">2</th><th align="left">3</th><th align="left">4</th><th align="left">5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">A</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B</td><td align="left">25</td><td align="left">25</td><td align="left">25</td><td align="left">25</td><td align="left">0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
