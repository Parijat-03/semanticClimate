Digital technology and mechanization have helped to maintain and monitor agricultural production, adjust food supply chains, sustain transportation of agricultural inputs and products, and connect food producers and consumers. However, the general willingness and capacity to innovate in agri-food sectors is lower than in most other sectors of the economy in most countries. Much of the public agricultural research takes place in developed country regions. It is also an increasing focus of middle-income countries. However, in most developing countries the capacity of many national agricultural research systems is limited and profoundly underfunded (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Beintema and Echeverria, 2020</xref>). In a review of research and development in agriculture, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Fuglie (2018)</xref> highlights the importance of increasing investments in enabling further growth in agricultural productivity. Fostering innovation, technological transfer, and scaleup of sustainable practices during the recovery process will be essential if we are to build more resilient food systems.</p>
