Con&#64258;ict and changes in weather patterns can worsen conditions for people working in rainfed agriculture or subsistence farming, interrupting production systems, degrading land and vegetation further (Papaioannou 2016; Adano and Daudi 2012). In recent decades, droughts and other climatic stressors have compounded livelihood pressures in areas already torn by strife (Tessler et al. 2015; Raleigh et al. 2015), such as in the Horn of Africa. Seizing of agricultural land by competing factions, preventing food distribution in times of shortage have, in this region and others, contributed to a&#160;triad of food insecurity, humanitarian need, and large movements of people (Theisen et al. 2011; Mohmmed et al. 2018; Ayeb-Karlsson et al. 2016; von Uexkull et al. 2016; Gleick 2014; Maystadt and Ecker 2014). People &#64258;eeing complex situations may return if peaceful conditions can be established. Climate change and development responses induced by climate change in countries and regions are likely to exacerbate tensions over water and land, and its impact on agriculture, &#64257;sheries, livestock and drinking water downstream. Shared pastoral landscapes used by disadvantaged or otherwise vulnerable communities are particularly impacted on by con&#64258;icts that are likely to become more severe under future climate change (Salehyan and Hendrix 2014; Hendrix and Salehyan 2012).
