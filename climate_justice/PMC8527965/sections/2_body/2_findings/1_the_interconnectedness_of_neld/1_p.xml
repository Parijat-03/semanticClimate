Concerns for biodiversity and ecosystems were followed closely by losses and damages to human health and then intolerable losses to Indigenous knowledge, identity, and culture and heritage. Losses and damages related to mobility, social cohesion, sense of place, agency, life and territory were the least prominent losses according to stakeholders. The key finding here, however, is the interconnectedness between these seemingly disparate categories of NELD. The inherent interconnectedness became clear when participants were asked to identify which NELD they valued most. Responses included &#8220;All of them are important to our living&#8221; and &#8220;We cannot value one over the other and be more concerned about one at the expense of the other&#8212;all are linked to each other&#8221; (participants #17 and #15, 2020).</p>
