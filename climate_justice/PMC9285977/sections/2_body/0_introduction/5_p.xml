<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We identify five key themes in these two waves. First, the research has explored motivations for action asking why local governments and other responsible institutions in cities act on climate change. Second, scholars have been concerned with how to deliver such action. Third, as calls for coordination gave the research theme an international orientation, interest grew on how to govern the city within the international climate regime. Fourth, alongside these themes, there has been a consistent concern with the question of climate justice and how climate action addresses or fosters further urban discrimination and inequality. The increasing interest in justice&#8208;related themes has fostered interest in examining the inseparable nature of climate change and politics, issues of power and control, conflicts, and the inherently unjust nature of much climate policy. Fifth, while there is some research on the delivery of policy in practice, there remains a gap in terms of having a consistent and comparative body of research that addresses the everyday realities of climate action.</p>
