<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0260">This article has provided just a glimpse into what is at stake in challenging court injunctions designed to advance the narrowest ideas of &#8216;justice&#8217; as framed by the expanding fossil fuel industry. Diverse moments in the trials and sentencing hearings brought out different points of emphasis &#8211; moves of prosecutors and the judge toward denying the imminent threats of climate change, mocking Indigenous values and laws, aggressive word choices to characterise defendants, and arbitrary impositions based on ever-changing rationales of criminal versus civil contempt to inflict maximum distress to those courageous enough to stand up. Building on political ecology scholarship that scrutinizes the hegemony of oil and bitumen in contemporary political relations, particularly work by <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Simpson (2019)</xref> and <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt (2020)</xref>, I have argued that critical attention is needed to settler-court <italic>performances of power</italic> in criminalising land and water protectors, through both subtle and overt courthouse manoeuvres. While it is possible to argue that civil disobedience and direct action is now becoming increasingly &#8216;mainstreamed&#8217;, the efforts of land and water defence often remain poorly understood &#8211; and strategically misrepresented &#8211; by those watching from the sidelines. With growing numbers of people willing to put their bodies on the line in anti-colonial solidarity, courtroom ethnography generates spaces of contextual and intersectional interaction for viscerally understanding the <italic>ethos of collective care</italic> in the midst of violent processes of colonial &#8216;rule of law&#8217;, providing avenues for thinking carefully about geographies of justice and injustice, fossil fuels and spatial politics.</p>
