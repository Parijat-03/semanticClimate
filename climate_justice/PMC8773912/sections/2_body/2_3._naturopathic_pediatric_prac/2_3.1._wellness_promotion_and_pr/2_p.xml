<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Naturopathic students&#8212;like all healthcare trainees&#8212;are also trained to seek opportunities for surveillance and anticipatory guidance at every visit, and regular wellness-focused visits are often encouraged to more THOROUGHLY engage in health promotion and the sequential monitoring of healthy growth and development [<xref rid="B16-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Well-child checks are typically advised to be consistent with recommended immunization schedules. Although most guidelines recommend annual well-child visits after 2.5 years of age, thorough health promotion may be more effective if done semi-annually, quarterly, or more frequently if it appears to be necessary to address all concerns [<xref rid="B22-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Naturopathic doctors are trained to utilize evidence-informed guidelines for screening, well-child promotion, and primary prevention [<xref rid="B26-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to ensure key determinants of health are addressed. As they do for all primary healthcare providers, well-child visits consist of a thorough history, a comprehensive physical exam, any indicated objective screening measures, relevant labs, and anticipatory guidance, depending on scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors in some jurisdictions can and do offer the full scope of recommended childhood immunizations. NDs in other jurisdictions cannot provide this healthcare service, but may engage in discussions of immunization to encourage informed consent. </p>
