In the pre- and post-Paris era, however, China has actively engaged in considerable international cooperation to reach and implement the Paris Agreement, and at the same time has significantly increased domestic climate actions (Belis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). China has embraced international climate leadership (Engels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>; Tiberghien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>).</p>
