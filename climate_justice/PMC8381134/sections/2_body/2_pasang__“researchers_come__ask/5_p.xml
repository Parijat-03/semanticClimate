His speech in Nepali, translated into English, highlighted how Kathmandu-based experts visit the region, write their reports based on limited stay, and bring &#8220;solutions&#8221; to problems that do not necessarily fit local conditions or are effective in the long run. The next day, a professional cheesemaker from the same village echoed the official&#8217;s remarks and underscored the need for proper consultation with the villagers. He also pointed out, speaking in Nepali, that although he may not have an official university certificate, his long-term knowledge of the local environment is based on meticulous lifelong observation, first as a pastoralist and later as a cheesemaker.</p>
