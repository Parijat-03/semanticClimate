      <td>The Gulf Stream is part of two circulation patterns in the North Atlantic: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation (AMOC) and the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Based on models and theory, scientific studies\nindicate that, while the AMOC is expected to slow in a warming climate, the Gulf Stream will not change much\nand would not shut down totally, even if the AMOC did. Most climate models project that the AMOC slows in the\nlater 21st century under most emissions scenarios, with some models showing it slowing even sooner. The Gulf\nStream affects the weather and sea level, so if it slows, North America will see higher sea levels and Europe&#8217;s</td>

The rotation of the Earth causes the big currents in\nboth circulations to stay on the western side of their basin, which in the Atlantic means the circulations combine\nto form the Gulf Stream. Other large currents contribute to gyres, such as the Kuroshio in the North Pacific\nand the East Australian Current in the South Pacific, but the Gulf Stream is special in its dual role.
