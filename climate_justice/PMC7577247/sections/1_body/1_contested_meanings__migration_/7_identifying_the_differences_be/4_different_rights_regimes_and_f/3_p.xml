<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0085">We do not suggest MR is the ideal solution in all circumstances. Indeed, retreat can be expensive (<xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">Thomas and Benjamin, 2018</xref>), it is not widely accepted (<xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Arnall, 2019</xref>), may change people&#8217;s access to important natural resources such as land, water and plants (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Hammond, 2008</xref>), and outcomes may undermine livelihoods (<xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Kothari, 2014</xref>). For example, the resettlement sites for farmers in Rwanda were located on rocky soils not conducive for growing crops. This forced them to return to vulnerable riverside plots where they faced potential fines or jail time (<xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Gebauer and Doevenspeck, 2015</xref>). Despite these challenges, MR offers a chance for compensation of property loss due to climate change impacts compared to CM.</p>
