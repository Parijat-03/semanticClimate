<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par31">Transdisciplinary sciences have also begun developing relational approaches to knowing (Nicolescu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2002</xref>; Craps and Brugnach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Van Breda and Swilling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2018</xref>). Systems theory (incl. general systems theory, cybernetics, and complexity theory) is among the most prevalent discourses within these sciences (cf. Barile et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>; Preiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2018</xref>). According to Capra and Luisi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>), systems thinking developed in the 1920s by biologists, Gestalt psychologists, ecologists, and quantum physicists. It is characterized by several important shifts of perspective: from the parts to the whole; from disciplines to multidisciplinarity; from objects to relationships; from measuring to mapping; from quantities to qualities; from structures to processes; from objective to epistemic science; and from Cartesian certainty to approximate knowledge (pp. 80&#8211;82).</p>
