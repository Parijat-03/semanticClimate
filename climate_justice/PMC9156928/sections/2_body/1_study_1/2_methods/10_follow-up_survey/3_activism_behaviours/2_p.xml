She monitored how many climate activism events were attended by each participant. The events were held on Zoom during this period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She did so by comparing all sign-in names on Zoom calls with the names of the participants of our study, and if any match was found, one &#8216;event score&#8217; was added for each participant attending. This was repeated at every event so that for all participants of our experiment, there was a record showing which events they attended. Participants also self-reported their environmental education and leadership behaviours and their emissions reduction behaviours.</p>
