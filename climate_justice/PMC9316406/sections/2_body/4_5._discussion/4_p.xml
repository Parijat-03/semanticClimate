<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In non-disaster settings, macro-level social work strategies advocate for inclusive policies and programs to protect everyone when disasters hit [<xref rid="B81-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Since vulnerable and marginalized populations are always more detrimentally affected by extreme events, social workers should provide a particular focus on these groups in disaster settings. Furthermore, supporting the interdisciplinary collaboration enhances social workers&#8217; capacity to inform the related policies and programs that could improve multi-stakeholder community development. GSW requires social workers to advocate environmental and social justice in policy and program development [<xref rid="B75-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These policies and programs, in turn, should guarantee the education of more social workers and other professionals who can apply a holistic approach to address the individual and collective health and well-being. </p>
