Focusing on the latter in particular, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson (2018)</xref> proposes that questions of morality need to be seen as embedded in the very development of movement in any living organism. He links the ability to move and communicate to the development of moral reasoning as &#8220;mobility facilitates the development of the virtue of justice&#8221; (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson, 2018</xref>, page 225). Given that the boundaries between subjects and their environments are fluid, this means that both mobility and notions and practices of justice have to be understood as relational, co-constituted, historical and &#8211; we would add &#8211; geographical. In fact, a mobile ontology becomes a core precondition for the development of a predisposition towards justice that overcomes the limits of distributive approaches, which for many critical theorists are ultimately grounded in a masculinist, Euro-American/white, ableist, heterosexual understanding of being and the wider world.</p>
