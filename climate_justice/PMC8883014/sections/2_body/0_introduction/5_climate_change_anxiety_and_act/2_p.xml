Research indicates that CCA and pessimism related to climate change are more commonly endorsed in adolescence and young adulthood when compared both to childhood (Ojala, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>) and middle and late adulthood (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). In addition to elevated concerns about climate change specifically, emerging adults are more likely to meet criteria for a mental health disorder compared to other age groups (e.g., Henin &amp; Berman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>). MDD and GAD are particularly likely to develop in emerging adulthood (Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Of note, college students appear to have been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, showing increased anxiety and distress relative to the general population (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). Thus, while young adults may be particularly well-positioned to engage in climate activism and are increasingly taking on the mantle of responsibility to address this global threat, it is also important to better understand how this may relate to their mental health, both for their sakes individually and for sustainability of the social movement.</p>
