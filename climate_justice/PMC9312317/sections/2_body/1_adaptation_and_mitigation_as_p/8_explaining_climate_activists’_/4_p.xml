Specifically, a prioritization of adaptation is presumably related to more conservative views on climate action and a reluctance to support far-reaching, transformational climate action. Research suggests that the transformational views of adaptation discussed above have remained marginal compared to more conservative, mainstream approaches (cf. Simonet and Fatori&#263; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>; Bassett and Fogelman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). Research among climate movement leaders in particular suggests that this pattern is reflected as adaptation is often still understood as a conservative project&#8212;exceptions notwithstanding (de Moor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>). If transformational views on adaptation are rare even among movement leaders, who can be expected to have more specialized knowledge of climate politics, it is to be assumed that such views would be even more rare in the rank and file of the movement.</p>
