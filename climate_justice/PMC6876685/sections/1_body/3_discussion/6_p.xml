Participating students tended to enter the course thinking that climate change is not yet harming people&#8212;a finding consistent with other recent studies (Leiserowitz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Spence, Poortinga, &amp; Pidgeon, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). At the beginning of the course, only 33% of participants correctly identified that climate change is already harming people. Instead, at the beginning of the semester, these students thought climate change would not harm humans for at least another decade, and a quarter of them thought it would be at least 50&#160;years before climate change would start to harm people. The number who initially recognized that climate change is already harming people was surprisingly low, especially given these students' overall acceptance of climate change (see above). After all, existing research suggests that 39% of Americans think that climate change is harming people in the US now (Leiserowitz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). One important effect of instruction in the introductory biology course we examined was that, by the end of the semester, participants better understood that climate change is already harming people, with 63% correctly choosing &#8220;now&#8221; when asked to identify the point at which climate change would begin to harm people.</p>
