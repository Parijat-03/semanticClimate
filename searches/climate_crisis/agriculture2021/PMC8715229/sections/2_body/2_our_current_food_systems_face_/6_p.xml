<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0160">Our food systems are associated with large environmental externalities. The agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) sector contributes around 23% to net anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>). Agricultural activities and associated land use changes are major drivers of biodiversity loss and environmental degradation (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">D&#237;az et al., 2019</xref>). Agriculture has profoundly altered nutrient cycles and water and natural resource use, affecting terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems (<xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2019a</xref>). The increasing application of nitrogen fertilizer is contributing to a rise in atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide and thus to climate change, which calls for greater attention to mitigation options in global food systems (<xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). The accumulation of plastic waste in terrestrial and marine systems, requires also rethinking and innovation concerning the use of plastics in food packaging (<xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">WEF, 2016</xref>).</p>
