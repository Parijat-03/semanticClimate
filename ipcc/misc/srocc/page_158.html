However, regional trends in frequency and intensity of drought are evident in several parts of the world, particularly in low latitude land areas, such as the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East (Vicente-Serrano et&#160;al. 2014; Spinoni et&#160;al. 2015a; Dai and Zhao 2017; P&#225;scoa et&#160;al. 2017), many regions of sub-Saharan Africa (Masih&#160;et&#160;al. 2014; Dai and Zhao 2017), central China (Wang&#160;et&#160;al. 2017e), the southern Amazon (Fu et&#160;al. 2013; Espinoza&#160;et&#160;al. 2018), India (Ramarao et&#160;al. 2016), east and south Asia, parts of North America and eastern Australia (Dai and Zhao 2017). A recent analysis of 4500 meteorological droughts globally found increased drought frequency over the East Coast of the USA, Amazonia and north-eastern Brazil, Patagonia, the Mediterranean region, most of Africa and north-eastern China with decreased drought frequency over northern Argentina, Uruguay and northern Europe (Spinoni et&#160;al. 2019). The study also found drought intensity has become more severe over north-western USA, parts of Patagonia and southern Chile, the Sahel, the Congo River basin, southern Europe, north-eastern China, and south-eastern Australia, whereas the eastern USA, south-eastern Brazil, northern Europe, and central-northern Australia experienced less severe droughts.

Although trees are more resilient to heat stress than grasslands (Teuling et&#160;al. 2010), it has been observed that different types of forest (e.g., needleleaf vs broadleaf) respond differently to drought and heatwaves (Babst et&#160;al. 2012). For example, in the Turkish Anatolian forests net primary productivity (NPP) generally decreased during drought and heatwave events between 2000 and 2010 but in a few other regions, NPP of needle leaf forests increased (Er&#351;ahin et&#160;al. 2016). However, forests may become less resilient to heat stress in future due to the long recovery period required to replace lost biomass and the projected increased frequency of heat and drought events (Frank et&#160;al. 2015a; McDowell and Allen 2015; Johnstone et&#160;al. 2016; Stevens-Rumann et&#160;al. 2018). Additionally, widespread regional tree mortality may be triggered directly by drought and heat stress (including warm winters) and exacerbated by insect outbreak and &#64257;re (Neuvonen et&#160;al. 1999; Breshears et&#160;al. 2005; Berg et&#160;al. 2006; Soja et&#160;al. 2007; Kurz&#160;et&#160;al. 2008; Allen et&#160;al. 2010).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="495.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.87; y0: 495.56; y1: 505.06; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="495.56" x1="566.11">Gross primary production (GPP) and soil respiration form the &#64257;rst and second largest carbon &#64258;uxes from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in the global carbon cycle (Beer et&#160;al. 2010; Bond-Lamberty and Thomson 2010).

Compound heat and drought events result in a stronger carbon sink reduction compared to single-factor extremes as GPP is strongly reduced and ecosystem respiration less so (Reichstein et&#160;al. 2013; Von Buttlar et&#160;al. 2018). In forest biomes, however, GPP may increase temporarily as a result of increased insolation and photosynthetic activity as was seen during the 2015&#8211;2016 ENSO related drought over Amazonia (Zhu et&#160;al. 2018). Longer extreme events (heatwave or drought or both) result in a greater reduction in carbon sequestration and may also reverse long-term carbon sinks (Ciais et&#160;al. 2005; Phillips et&#160;al. 2009; Wolf et&#160;al. 2016b; Ummenhofer and Meehl 2017; Von&#160;Buttlar et&#160;al. 2018; Reichstein et&#160;al. 2013). Furthermore, extreme heat events may impact the carbon cycle beyond the lifetime of the event. These lagged effects can slow down or accelerate the carbon cycle: it will slow down if reduced vegetation productivity and/or widespread mortality after an extreme drought are not compensated by regeneration, or speed up if productive tree and shrub seedlings cause rapid regrowth after windthrow or &#64257;re (Frank et&#160;al. 2015a). Although some ecosystems may demonstrate resilience to a single heat climate stressor like drought (e.g., forests), compound effects of, for example, deforestation, &#64257;re and drought, potentially can result in changes to regional precipitation patterns and river discharge, losses of carbon storage and a transition to a disturbance-dominated regime (Davidson et&#160;al. 2012). Additionally, adaptation to seasonal drought may be overwhelmed by multi-year drought and their legacy effects (Brando et&#160;al. 2008; da Costa et&#160;al. 2010). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="111.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.67; y0: 111.56; y1: 121.06; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="111.56" x1="566.11">Under medium- and high-emission scenarios, global warming will exacerbate heat stress, thereby amplifying de&#64257;cits in soil moisture and runoff despite uncertain precipitation changes (Ficklin and Novick 2017; Berg and Shef&#64257;eld 2018; Cook et&#160;al. 2018; Dai et&#160;al.&#160;2018; Engelbrecht et&#160;al. 2015; Ramarao et&#160;al. 2015; Grillakis 2019).
