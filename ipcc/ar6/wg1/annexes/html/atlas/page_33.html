Figure Atlas.25:a shows 32 the trend of annual temperature for the period of 1980-2014. Most areas of East Asia have significant 33 warming trends exceeding 0.1&#176;C per decade, and the strongest warming (0.42-0.52&#176;C per decade) occurs in 34 the northern China. 35 36 The change in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) presents a clear interdecadal variation rather than a 37 linear trend since the 1900s (Zhang, 2015; Zhou et al., 2017b). Evidence indicates that the &#8220;southern flood 38 and northern drought&#8221; (SFND) anomalous pattern in eastern China after the 1970s has been changed with the 39 recovering EASM since the early 1990s. Summer flooding events have increased in the Huaihe River valley 40 and the monsoon rain belt has tended to move northward in eastern China (Liu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 41 2015). The summer rainfall daily frequency and intensity over East Asia show significantly decreasing and 42 increasing trends from 1961 to 2014, respectively (Zhou and Wang, 2017b). Accompanied by the recovery 43 of the summer monsoon, the summer rainfall characteristics exhibit enhanced trends from 1979 to 2014, 44 based on highly-resolved in-situ observations and eight current reanalysis products (Zhou and Wang, 2017a). 45 Mean and extreme rainfall and the number of rainy days during the Meiyu/Baiu/Changma period from June 46 to September have increased, and the dry spell has become shorter (Lee et al., 2017). Precipitation amounts 47 exhibited a substantial decrease at both the annual and seasonal scales in Japan for the period 1901&#8211;2012 48 (Duan et al., 2015).
