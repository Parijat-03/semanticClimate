Beck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>) also challenged the focus of conventional policy discourse on finding solutions, arguing that such discourse is blind to the fact that climate change has <italic>already</italic> changed the world. He emphasised that talking about &#8216;bads&#8217; would produce the new normative horizons of common goods&#8212;which he called the &#8216;hidden emancipatory side effect of global risk&#8217; (Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>). This is clearly evidenced by <italic>Fridays for Future</italic>, a climate justice movement led by the new generation. Young people are mobilised to walk out of school and onto the street not only by a sense of urgency of the climate crisis but due to moral and emphatic anger over the unfair treatment of the other (Antadze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). And yet, the slogan of this burgeoning youth activism is caught up in delivering the message of &#8216;listening to the science&#8217; (Evensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>).</p>
