<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Data on vulnerability indices were obtained from their respective websites [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We removed tracts that contained NA values for any of the indices; tracts received NA values from the score developers if they had insufficient or unreliable data for multiple variables or if their population was zero. For all indices, the highest percentile values indicated the most vulnerable census tracts. CES considers a tract vulnerable or &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; if its score is the 75th percentile or higher [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This threshold of vulnerability was employed for our analysis across all three indices. The number of indices under which a census tract could be considered vulnerable was then counted; we will refer to this metric as a census tract&#8217;s compound vulnerability score. Agreement of the three indices was further analyzed by grouping the census tracts into the nine climate regions defined by California&#8217;s Fourth Climate Change Assessment [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. If a tract straddled multiple regions it was assigned to the region in which it had greater area.</p>
