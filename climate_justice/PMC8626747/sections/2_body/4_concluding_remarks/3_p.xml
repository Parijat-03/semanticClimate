As Bj&#246;rkdahl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>) recall, &#8216;norms are concerned with the desirability of means and goals themselves&#8217;, which indicates that prescriptions that emphasize notions like responsibility, just transition and resilience through moral or ethical norms of behaviour must be analyzed more critically upon empirical scenarios of standard violations. From the analysis of the EU-Brazil and China-Brazil practices in this article, the harmonization of common interests presents great challenges for future climate norms and standards.</p>
