<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">There is a diversity of approaches for categorising countries on the basis of their level of development, and for defining terms such as âindustrialisedâ, âdevelopedâ or âdevelopingâ.</p>
<p>Several categorisations are used in this report. (1) In the United Nations (UN) system, there is no established convention for the designation of developed and developing countries or areas. (2) The UN Statistics Division specifies developed and developing regions based on common practice. In addition, specific countries are designated as Least Developed Countries, landlocked developing countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and transition economies. Many countries appear in more than one of these categories. (3) The World Bank uses income as the main criterion for classifying countries as low, lower middle, upper middle and high income. (4) The UN Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates indicators for life expectancy, educational attainment and income into a single composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify countries as low, medium, high or very high human development.</p>
