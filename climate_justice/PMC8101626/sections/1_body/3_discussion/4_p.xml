<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Despite the online format, important themes emerged from our topic modeling. Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 dominated much of the discourse on Twitter, with topics ranging from discussion surrounding airborne vs droplet transmission, emphasis on public health measures including nonpharmaceutical interventions, potential vaccine timelines and candidates, public health responses, and a path beyond the pandemic. However, other important topics were discussed, including the need to address health policy and disparities within Infectious Diseases, antibiotic stewardship, and clinical pearls. We believe the IDWeek organizers can use these data as a measure of success by understanding which topics or sessions were most commonly discussed. Similarly, if there were certain sessions they wished emphasized or highlighted through the program but these were not significantly discussed on Twitter, they could use this as an opportunity to promote these future sessions on Twitter to garner more interest.</p>
