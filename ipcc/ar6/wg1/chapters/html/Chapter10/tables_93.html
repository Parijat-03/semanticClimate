      <td>Box 10.3, Figure 1 | Urban warming compared to global GHG-induced warming. (a) Change in the annual mean surface air temperature over the period\n1950&#8211;2018 based on the local linear trend retrieved from CRU TS (&#176;C per 68 years). This background warming is compared to the local warming that has been\nreported during 1950&#8211;2018 in the literature from historical urbanization. The relative share of the total warming as percentage between the urban warming and\nthe surrounding warming is plotted in a circle for each city. This map has been compiled from a review study (Hamdi et al., 2020). (b) Low-pass filtered time series\nof the annual mean temperature (&#176;C) observed in the urban station of Tokyo (red line) and the rural reference station in Choshi (blue line) in Japan. The filter is the\nsame as the one used in Figure 10.10. (c) Uncertainties in the relative share of urban warming with respect to the total warming (%) related to the use of different\nglobal observational datasets: CRU TS (brown circles), Berkeley Earth (dark blue downward triangle), HadCRUT5 (cyan upward triangle), Cowtan Way (orange plus)\nand GISTEMP (purple squares). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 10.SM.11).</td>

Beside temperature, urbanization can\ninduce an urban dryness island, which refers to lower relative humidity in cities than in nearby rural locations (Lokoshchenko, 2017;\nBian et al., 2020) and the urban wind island, where slower wind speeds are observed in cities (Wu et al., 2017; Bader et al., 2018; Peng\net al., 2018).
