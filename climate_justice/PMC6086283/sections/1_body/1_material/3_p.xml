<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par11">The PA was the outcome of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21, November 30&#8211;December 12, 2015) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international environmental treaty negotiated in 1992 in order to achieve the &#8220;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&#8221; The framework convention does not contain any enforcement mechanisms nor does it impose binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries. Instead, the framework outlines how specific international treaties (&#8220;protocols&#8221; or &#8220;agreements&#8221;) may be negotiated to limit the increase of global average temperature. The PA is such a negotiated outcome. It will enter into force if joined by at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global greenhouse emissions. On 5 October 2016, this threshold was reached.</p>
