<p>The limit of shelf seas is conventionally considered as 200 m water depth at the continental shelf edge, where there is usually a steep slope to the deep <em>ocean</em> floor. During glacial periods, most shelf seas are lost since they become <em>land</em> as the build-up of <em>ice sheets</em> caused a decrease of global sea level.</p>
