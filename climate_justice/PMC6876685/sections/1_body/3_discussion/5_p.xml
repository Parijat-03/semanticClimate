<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Rather than devoting our efforts primarily or exclusively to cultivating a readerly climate literacy in students, the fact that many students come to our courses already accepting climate change means that science educators have a profound opportunity to help students develop a more writerly climate literacy, readying them to act responsively and responsibly on their developing climate change knowledge. Our task as instructors is not to &#8220;deposit&#8221; knowledge in students' heads (see Freire, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), but to support them in intervening in the very systems our courses help students to better understand. Some initial ideas for shifting the focus of climate pedagogy are discussed in greater depth later in this section.</p>
