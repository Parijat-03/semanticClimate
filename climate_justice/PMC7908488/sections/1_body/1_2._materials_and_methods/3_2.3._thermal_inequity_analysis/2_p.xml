<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We found spatial autocorrelation of LST in 19 out of our 20 metropolitan regions indicated by statistically significant values of Moran&#8217;s I [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The urban environment has a complex matrix of surface materials and surface geometry and the orientation of both [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] This plus local convection, conduction, and incident solar radiation can cause spatial autocorrelation in LST readings [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We controlled for this by running spatial error regression models. In total, we constructed 59 spatial error models to analyze how social indicators of neighborhood demographics influenced the UHI effect: 20 models for extreme heat in each metropolitan area as well as 20 models for average heat. We ran only 19 models for nighttime temperatures due to issues accessing nighttime temperatures for the Dallas metropolitan area.</p>
