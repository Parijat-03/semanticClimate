In part, this is because the dominant climate justice narrative in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> concerns the inter-state level. For over thirty years, the Chinese state has consistently emphasised the &#8216;common but differentiated responsibilities&#8217; (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1992</xref>, Art. 3.1) of developed and developing countries, including the responsibility of developed countries to provide financial assistance to developing countries (Bo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). This stance had greater bearing on China&#8217;s domestic climate finance during the years when external financing played a proportionately larger role (e.g. China was the largest recipient of finance under the Kyoto Protocol&#8217;s Clean Development Mechanism). It is less relevant to the current situation in which domestic financing dominates Chinese climate projects, while China has itself become a major outbound financier of mitigation and adaptation projects in third countries. Nevertheless, elements of &#8216;green finance&#8217; have targeted specific aspects of climate justice, including support for victims of disasters and poverty alleviation. More broadly, given China&#8217;s status as both the largest GHG emitter and a major international fossil fuel financer, aligning Chinese finance flows to the Article 2.1c goal can be seen as a prerequisite for climate-just outcomes internationally as well as domestically.</p>
