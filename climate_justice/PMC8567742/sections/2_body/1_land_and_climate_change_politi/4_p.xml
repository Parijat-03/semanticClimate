<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The definition separates, but at the same time binds together, politics and policies or projects &#8211; categories that are often muddled in the literature. Formally constituted and recognized climate change policies or projects are one of the components of climate change politics &#8211; the same relationship that land policies have to land politics. Labelled as climate change mitigation or adaptation measures, such policies and projects include &#8216;Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage&#8217; (BECCS) as well as officially recognized big forest conservation projects and REDD+ (Corbera, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). But as many scholars working from political economy and political ecology perspectives (e.g. Paprocki, <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) remind us these are not the only things that matter. Social relations of production and ecological and political conditions of nature (land, water, forest) could be significantly altered not only by climate change (e.g. droughts, floods) or formal climate change policies or projects, but also by wild speculations, rumours, gossip, spectacle or frenzy inspired or triggered by measures purported to address climate change. For example, many land brokers and speculators who have orchestrated the grabbing of land from ordinary villagers in diverse societies during the past decade have carried out their schemes by invoking the urgent need to address climate change through large-scale investments such as opening a plantation to cultivate feedstock for biofuel production &#8211; whether biofuel production actually takes place, is seriously planned, or is only wildly speculated (Fairhead et al., <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Franco &amp; Borras, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Hunsberger et al., <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
