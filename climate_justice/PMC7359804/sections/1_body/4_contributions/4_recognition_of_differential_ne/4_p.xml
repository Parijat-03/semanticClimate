<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Vecchio's (2020)</xref> account of micromobilities in Bogot&#225; shows the importance of recognising the strongly differentiated mobility needs and experiences of lower income residents. By narrating the struggles to access valued opportunities that the participants in his study experience because of spatial segregation and lack of public transport connections, Vecchio recognises mobility needs and habits that have so far remained unaddressed by Bogot&#225;'s often praised transport planning. He also draws attention to distributive justice as &#8220;every individual has different abilities to reach more or less varied opportunities&#8221; (p.7), with some participants forced to remain &#8220;shut-in&#8221; and others to be &#8220;forcedly mobile&#8221;.</p>
