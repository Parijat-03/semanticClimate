Moreover, land tenure security can lead to more investment in trees (Deininger and Jin 2006; Etongo et al. 2015). Land tenure recognition policies were found to lead to higher agricultural productivity and incomes, although with inter-regional variations, requiring an improved understanding of overlapping formal and informal land tenure rights (Lawry et al. 2017). For example, secure land tenure increased investments into SLM practices in Ghana, but without affecting farm productivity (Abdulai et al. 2011). Secure land tenure, especially for communally managed lands, helps reduce arbitrary appropriations of land for large-scale commercial farms (Aha and Ayitey 2017; Baumgartner 2017; Dell&#8217;Angelo et al. 2017). In contrast, privatisation of rangeland tenures in Botswana and Kenya led to the loss of communal grazing lands and actually increased rangeland degradation (Basupi et al. 2017; Kihiu 2016) as pastoralists needed to graze livestock on now smaller communal pastures.

More research is needed on the optimal tenure mix, including low-cost land certi&#64257;cation, redistribution reforms, market-assisted reforms and gender-responsive reforms, as well as collective forms of land tenure such as communal land tenure and cooperative land tenure (see Section&#160;7.6.5 for a&#160;broader discussion of land tenure security under climate change). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="224.38" top="243.58"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 243.58; y1: 253.08; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="243.58" x1="224.38">Payment for ecosystem services (PES) </span><span style="x0: 226.28; x1: 230.85; y0: 243.58; y1: 253.08; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="226.28" y0="243.58" x1="313.24">provides incentives for land restoration and SLM (</span><span style="x0: 162.57; x1: 169.43; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="162.57" y0="231.58" x1="233.36">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 233.36; x1: 236.0; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="233.36" y0="231.58" x1="313.24">) (Lambin et al. 2014; Li et al. 2018; Reed et al. 2015; Schiappacasse et al. 2012). Several studies illustrate that the social costs of deserti&#64257;cation are larger than its private cost (Costanza et al. 2014; Nkonya et al. 2016a). Therefore, although SLM can generate public goods in the form of provisioning ecosystem services, individual land custodians underinvest in SLM as they are unable to reap these bene&#64257;ts fully. Payment for ecosystem services provides a&#160;mechanism through which some of these bene&#64257;ts can be transferred to land users, thereby stimulating further investment in SLM. The effectiveness of PES schemes depends on land tenure security and appropriate design, taking into account speci&#64257;c local conditions (B&#246;rner et al. 2017). However, PES has not worked well in countries with fragile institutions (Karsenty and Ongolo 2012).

Yet, when reviewing the performance of PES programmes in the tropics, Calvet-Mir et al. (2015), found that they are generally effective in terms of environmental outcomes, despite being sometimes unfair in terms of payment distribution. It is suggested that the implementation of PES will be improved through decentralised approaches giving local communities a&#160;larger role in the decision-making process (He and Lang 2015).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.95" top="639.62"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 639.62; y1: 649.12; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="639.62" x1="571.95">Empowering local communities for decentralised natural resource management. </span><span style="x0: 420.25; x1: 424.12; y0: 627.62; y1: 637.12; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="420.25" y0="627.62" x1="571.77">Local institutions often play a&#160;vital role in implementing SLM initiatives and climate change adaptation measures (</span><span style="x0: 365.31; x1: 369.89; y0: 603.63; y1: 613.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="365.31" y0="603.63" x1="424.87">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 424.87; x1: 427.51; y0: 603.63; y1: 613.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="424.87" y0="603.63" x1="571.75">) (Gibson et al. 2005; Smucker et al. 2015). Pastoralists involved in community-based natural resource management in Mongolia had greater capacity to adapt to extreme winter frosts, resulting in less damage to their livestock (Fernandez-Gimenez et al. 2015). Decreasing the power and role of traditional community institutions, due to top-down public policies, resulted in lower success rates in community-based programmes focused on rangeland management in Dirre, Ethiopia (Abdu and Robinson 2017). Decentralised governance was found to lead to improved management in forested landscapes (Dressler et al. 2010; Ostrom and Nagendra 2006). However, there are also cases when local elites were placed in control and this decentralised natural resource management negatively impacted the livelihoods of the poorer and marginalised community members due to reduced access to natural resources (Andersson and Ostrom 2008; Cullman 2015; Dressler et al. 2010). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="399.64"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 399.64; y1: 409.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="399.64" x1="571.76">The success of decentralised natural resource management initiatives depends on increased participation and empowerment of a&#160;diverse set of community members, not only local leaders and elites, in the design and management of local resource management institutions (Kadirbeyoglu and &#214;zertan 2015; Umutoni et al. 2016), while considering the interactions between actors and institutions at different levels of governance (Andersson and Ostrom 2008; Carlisle and Gruby 2017; McCord et al. 2017). An example of such programmes where local communities played a&#160;major role in land restoration and rehabilitation activities is the cooperative project on The National Afforestation and Erosion Control Mobilization Action Plan in Turkey, initiated by the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (&#199;ali&#351;kan and Boydak 2017), with the investment of&#160;1.8&#160;billion USD between 2008 and 2012. The project mobilised local communities in cooperation with public institutions, municipalities, and non-governmental organisations, to implement afforestation, rehabilitation and erosion control measures, resulting in the afforestation and reforestation of&#160;1.5 Mha (Yurtoglu 2015). Moreover, some&#160;1.75 Mha of degraded forest and 37,880 ha of degraded rangelands were rehabilitated. Finally, the project provided employment opportunities for 300,000 rural residents for six months every year, combining land restoration and rehabilitation activities with measures to promote socio-economic development in rural areas (&#199;ali&#351;kan and Boydak 2017).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="496.2" top="99.68"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.36; y0: 99.68; y1: 109.18; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="99.68" x1="496.2">Investing in research and development. </span><span style="x0: 499.87; x1: 505.32; y0: 99.68; y1: 109.18; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="499.87" y0="99.68" x1="571.75">Deserti&#64257;cation has received substantial research attention over recent decades (Turner et al. 2007).
