      <td>Improved food processing and retailing involves\nseveral practices related to a) greening supply chains\n(e.g., utilising products and services with a reduced impact\non the environment and human health), b) adoption\nof specific sustainability instruments among agri-food\ncompanies (e.g., eco-innovation practices), c) adopting\nemission accounting tools (e.g., carbon and water\nfoot-printing), d) implementing &#8216;demand forecasting&#8217;\nstrategies (e.g., changes in consumer preference for\n&#8216;green&#8217; products) and, e) supporting polycentric supply-\nchain governance processes.</td>
      <td>Improved food processing and retailing can provide benefits\nfor climate mitigation since GHG-friendly foods can reduce\nagri-food GHG emissions from transportation, waste and\nenergy use. In cases where climate extremes and natural\ndisasters disrupt supply chain networks, improved food\nprocessing and retailing can benefit climate adaptation by\nbuffering the impacts of changing temperature and rainfall\npatterns on upstream agricultural production. It can provide\nbenefits for food security by supporting healthier diets and\nreducing food loss and waste. Successful implementation\nis dependent on organisational capacity, the agility and\nflexibility of business strategies, the strengthening of public-\nprivate policies and effectiveness of supply-chain governance.</td>

      <td>Improved energy\nuse in food systems</td>
      <td>Agriculture&#8217;s energy efficiency can be improved to\nreduce the dependency on non-renewable energy\nsources. This can be realised either by decreased\nenergy inputs, or through increased outputs per unit\nof input. In some countries, managerial inefficiency\n(rather than a technology gap) is the main source for\nenergy-efficiency loss. Heterogenous patterns of energy\nefficiency exist at the national scale and promoting\nenergy-efficient technologies along with managerial\ncapacity development can reduce the gap and provide\nlarge benefits for climate adaptation. Improvements in\ncarbon monitoring and calculation techniques such as\nthe foot-printing of agricultural products can enhance\nenergy-efficiency transition management and uptake\nin agricultural enterprises.</td>
      <td>Transformation to low-carbon technologies such as\nrenewable energy and energy efficiency can offer\nopportunities for significant climate change mitigation,\nfor example, by providing a substitute to transport fuel\nthat could benefit marginal agricultural resources, while\nsimultaneously contributing to long-term economic growth.\nIn poorer nations, increased energy efficiency in agricultural\nvalue-added production, in particular, can provide large\nmitigation benefits. Under certain scenarios, the efficiency of\nagricultural systems can stagnate and could exert pressure\non grasslands and rangelands, thereby impacting on land\ndegradation and desertification. Rebound effects can also\noccur, with adverse impacts on emissions.</td>

      <td>Unplanned urbanisation leading to sprawl and\nextensification of cities along the rural-urban fringe has\nbeen identified as a driver of forest and agricultural land\nloss and a threat to food production around cities. It\nhas been estimated that urban expansion will result in\na 1.8&#8211;2.4% loss of global croplands by 2030. This rapid\nurban expansion is especially strong in new emerging\ntowns and cities in Asia and Africa.
