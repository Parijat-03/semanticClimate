About 230&#160;million Indian people lack access to electricity, and around 800&#160;million still use solid fuels for cooking (Sharma, 2019). The average electricity access rate in South Asia was 74%, the equivalent of 417&#160;million people without electricity and accounting for more than a third of the global 1.2&#160;billion lacking the access (Shukla et&#160;al., 2017). With a total population of nearly 640&#160;million in ASEAN, an estimated 65&#160;million people remain without electricity and 250&#160;million rely on solid biomass for cooking fuel (IEA, 2017). Universal access to electricity is expected to be achieved by 2030, while 1.6&#160;billion people in Asia will still lack clean energy for cooking (UNESCAP, 2018b).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.66" top="546.6"><span x0="54.0" y0="546.6" x1="307.66" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 59.4; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 5.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asia faces an energy security problem even with the rapid growth in production and trade (IEEJ, 2018). Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high energy security risk (WEC, 2018). This will be a major challenge for the sustainable development of Asia due to the vulnerability to global energy supplies and price volatility (Nangia, 2019). Asia lacks natural energy resources and has the smallest oil reserve but largely relies on fossil fuels. The dependency on fossil fuels was as high as 88.3% in China, 72.3% in India, 89.6% in Japan and 82.8% in Republic of Korea in 2013 (BP, 2014). Many countries in South Asia rely on a single source to supply more than half of the electricity (i.e., 67.9% from coal for India, 99.9% from hydropower for Nepal, 91.5% from natural gas for Bangladesh and 50.2% from oil for Sri Lanka) (Shukla et&#160;al., 2017). Additionally, cooperation in Asia to create the integrated energy systems needed for enhancing overall security is still at a very preliminary stage due to countries having different strategic plans and lack of cooperation among them on the common concerns (Kimura and Phoumin, 2013).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="305.46" top="330.6"><span x0="54.0" y0="330.6" x1="305.46" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.4; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Even though energy efficiency is improving, the deployment of low-carbon energy, such as renewables, is not sufficient in Asia. To be consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, the share of renewables in total energy consumption needs to reach 35% in Asia by 2030. Moreover, the financing to deploy renewables presents another considerable challenge (UNESCAP, 2018b).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.75" top="246.61"><span x0="54.0" y0="246.61" x1="307.75" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 56.3; y0: 246.61; y1: 256.11; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In order to cope with climate change, renewable energy has become the core of energy development and transformation. Since the 1960s, the total solar radiation on the ground in Asia has shown a downwards trend as a whole, which is consistent with the change in global total solar radiation on the ground, and has experienced a phased change process of &#8216;first darkening and then brightening&#8217; (</span><span style="x0: 228.87; x1: 233.45; y0: 186.62; y1: 196.12; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="228.87" y0="186.62" x1="285.45">high confidence</span><span x0="285.45" y0="186.62" x1="307.72" style="x0: 285.45; x1: 288.09; y0: 186.62; y1: 196.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). This conclusion has been further confirmed by ground station observations, satellite remote sensing inversion data and model simulation research (Wang and Wild, 2016; Qin et&#160;al., 2018; Yang et&#160;al., 2018a).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.72" top="126.63"><span x0="54.0" y0="126.63" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 59.45; y0: 126.63; y1: 136.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">However, wind speed over most Asian regions is obviously decreasing (</span><span style="x0: 56.59; x1: 61.17; y0: 114.63; y1: 124.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="56.59" y0="114.63" x1="115.33">high confidence</span><span x0="115.33" y0="114.63" x1="307.79" style="x0: 115.33; x1: 117.97; y0: 114.63; y1: 124.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). Based on meteorological observation records or reanalysis data, many studies have analysed the variation of near-surface average wind speed in Asia. It is generally found that wind speed has declined since the 1970s, although the declining trend is different in different subregions. (Yang et&#160;al., 2012c; Lin et&#160;al., 2013; Liu et&#160;al., 2014b; Zha et&#160;al., 2016; Guo et&#160;al., 2017a; Torralba et&#160;al., 2017; </span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.87" top="714.64"><span x0="318.19" y0="714.64" x1="571.87" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 714.64; y1: 724.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asia is consistent with the general decline of global land-surface wind speeds, among which the frequency of strong winds and the decline of wind speed are more prominent (McVicar et&#160;al., 2012; Jiang et&#160;al., 2013; Blunden and Arndt, 2017; Wu et&#160;al., 2018c). Since the early 2010s, the average wind speed in the world and some parts of Asia has shown signs of increasing (Li et&#160;al., 2018d; Wu et&#160;al., 2018c; Zeng et&#160;al., 2019), which seems to be an inter-decadal variability. Whether this means a change in its trend needs the support of longer observation data.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.93" top="606.65"><span x0="318.19" y0="606.65" x1="571.93" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 606.65; y1: 616.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">At the same time, with the increase in the proportion of renewable energy in the power system, the power system will be more vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather and climate events, and the vulnerability and risk of the power system will greatly increase (</span><span style="x0: 320.83; x1: 327.69; y0: 558.66; y1: 568.16; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="320.83" y0="558.66" x1="391.18">medium confidence</span><span x0="391.18" y0="558.66" x1="396.1" style="x0: 391.18; x1: 393.82; y0: 558.66; y1: 568.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="432.13" top="534.48"><span x0="318.19" y0="534.48" x1="432.13" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.99; y0: 534.48; y1: 544.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.1.3 Adaptation Options</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.89" top="510.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="510.6" x1="571.89" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The overall solution would be to develop a resilient energy system and avoid the risk of unsustainable energy growth in developing Asia. This requires that strategic planning be consistent with the long-term climate projection, impact and adaptation (EUEI-PDF, 2017). Although no single policy package would be applicable for all the countries across the region, several measures could be addressed as the common options, including fortification of energy infrastructure and diversification of the sources by sufficient investment, improvement of energy efficiency for sector flexibility, and promotion of regional cooperation and integration for increasing energy security (UNESCAP, 2018b). Adaptation also includes promoting renewable energy resources, securing local natural gas resources, enhancing water production and adopting green-building technologies. These adaptation measures may help increase readiness for the anticipated impact of climate change.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.92" top="318.63"><span x0="318.19" y0="318.63" x1="571.92" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 318.63; y1: 328.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The improvement of energy efficiency and demand-side management can alleviate supply constraints and thus lower overall required-energy capacity. Energy storage, smart grids for the electricity network as well as other flexible management measures enable this energy demand shifting. Regional integration of energy markets drives productivity increase, cost reduction, new investment, human capability and diversity of energy sources (WEC, 2018). For example, better interconnection of natural gas supply networks among the ASEAN countries enhances gas security in the region. The development of the long-planned regional power grid would make large-scale renewable projects more viable and aid the integration of rising shares of wind and solar power (IEA, 2017).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.89" top="162.64"><span x0="318.19" y0="162.64" x1="571.89" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.76; y0: 162.64; y1: 172.14; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Providing enough investment in energy supply is a top priority to extend the connections to those without access to electricity and satisfy the soaring demand (IEA, 2017). The investment in non-fossil energies like renewables has been expanding to leverage the economic growth in China, India and Republic of Korea. According to the updated estimate of ADB, 14.7 trillion USD will be needed for the infrastructure development in the power sector of developing Asia over the 15&#160;years from 2016 to 2030 (ADB, 2017a). The cumulative investment needs of ASEAN for energy supply and efficiency up to 2040 is estimated at 2.7 to 2.9 trillion USD (IEA, 2017). Mobilising investment to such a </span></div></body></html>
