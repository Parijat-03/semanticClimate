Human activities driving deforestation and degradation have already turned the Brazilian Amazon into a carbon source (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and other tropical biomes may be moving toward a similar fate, compounded by the effects of higher temperatures and increased frequency of droughts on tree growth and mortality (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Global warming also increases risks of wildfires in temperate and boreal forests, which could flip Northern hemisphere ecosystems from sink to source in coming decades (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This has led to rising concerns that human activities risk triggering biosphere feedbacks that could set the planet on a trajectory away from Holocene conditions toward a much warmer state, with potentially catastrophic effects for societies and ecosystems (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
