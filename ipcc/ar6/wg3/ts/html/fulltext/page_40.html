Traced from a purely labour 4 movement, trade union space, the Just Transition framework emphasises that decent work and 5 environmental protection are not incompatible. During COP 24, with the Just Transition Silesia 6 Declaration, the concept gained in recognition and was signed by 56 Heads of State. 7 </span></div><div left="72.02" right="56.76" top="647.76"><span x0="72.02" y0="647.76" x1="56.76" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 75.7; y0: 647.76; y1: 658.8; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Implicit in a Just Transition is the notion of well-being, equity and justice &#8211; the realisation that 8 transitions are inherently disruptive and deliberate effort may be required to ensure communities 9 dependent on fossil-fuel based economies and industries do not suffer disproportionately {Chapter 4}. 10 &#8216;Just transitions&#8217; are integral to the European Union as mentioned in the EU Green Deal, the Scottish 11 Government&#8217;s development plans and other national low carbon transition strategies. The US Green 12 New Deal Resolution puts structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and &#8216;Just Transitions&#8217; at its centre. 13 There is a growing awareness of the need for shifting finance towards Just Transition in the context of 14 the COVID-19, in particular, public finance and governance have a major role in allowing Just 15 Transition broadly {Chapter 15}. 16 </span></div><div left="72.02" right="56.76" top="516.57"><span x0="72.02" y0="516.57" x1="56.76" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 75.7; y0: 516.57; y1: 527.61; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, low oil prices created additional financial 17 problems for fossil fuel producer countries faced with loss of revenue and reduced fiscal latitude and 18 space. Public spending and social safety nets associated with the proceeds from producer economies 19 can be affected as assets become stranded and spending on strategic sustainable development goals such 20 as free education and health care services are neglected.  Fiscal challenges are intricately linked to &#8216;Just 21 Transitions&#8217; and the management associated with sustainable energy transition. There is no certainty on 22 how energy systems will recover post-COVID-19. However, &#8216;Just Transitions&#8217; will have equity 23 implications if stimulus packages are implemented without due regard for the differentiated scales and 24 speeds and national and regional contexts, especially in the context of developing countries. 25 </span></div><div left="72.02" right="56.76" top="385.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="385.27" x1="56.76" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 385.27; y1: 396.31; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">A Just Transition entails targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and other non-26 state authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts of economy-27 wide transitions are minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected. 28 These proactive measures include eradication of poverty, regulating prosperity and creating jobs in 29 &#8220;green&#8221; sectors. In addition, governments, polluting industries, corporations, and those more able to 30 pay higher associated taxes, can pay for transition costs by providing a welfare safety net and adequate 31 compensation to people, communities, and regions that have been impacted by pollution, or are 32 marginalised, or are negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low- carbon economy and 33 society. There is, nonetheless, increased recognition that resources that can enable the transition, 34 international development institutions, as well as other transitional drivers such as tools, strategies and 35 finance, are scarce.
