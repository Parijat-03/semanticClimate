First, the field of research on climate change governance in urban areas is sensitive and responsive to policy debates. International political crises and agreements have supported the development of the field. Scholars have remained wedded to terminology developed in policy discussions, despite ongoing criticisms from some sectors within academia. For example, the language of &#8220;adaptation&#8221; and &#8220;mitigation,&#8221; which structures the delivery of the IPCC reports, remains consistently used in the papers reviewed. Despite their visibility, alternative conceptualizations of urban action (low carbon, resilient, smart) have been confined to disciplinary debates and appear much less frequently than the more generally accepted concepts of adaptation and mitigation.</p>
