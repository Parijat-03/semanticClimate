      <td>Pepin et al., 2015), leading to warming of 2&#176;C&#8211;2.5&#176;C at 5000 m over 1961&#8211;2006, but only 0.5&#176;C at sea level (Xu et al., 2016). However,\nEDW behaviour appears to depend on region, time period and elevation (D. Guo et al., 2019; b. Li et al., 2020) and understanding is limited\nby the sparse observational network (You et al., 2020). Observational and model analyses have attributed EDW to GHG and black carbon\nemissions, accelerating warming by snow-albedo feedback (Ming et al., 2012; Gautam et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016; Lau\nand Kim, 2018; Y. Zhang et al., 2018), or the more pronounced cooling effect of scattering aerosols at low elevations and stratospheric\nozone depletion (Guo and Wang, 2012; Zeng et al., 2015). There is high confidence that the eastern and central HKH has exhibited rising\ntemperatures (Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, Figure 1), with warming dependent on season and elevation. There is high confidence that much of\nthe warming can be attributed to GHGs, but the effect of albedo has only medium confidence. There is high confidence in more frequent\nextreme warm events and fewer extreme cold events over the eastern Himalayas in the last five decades.</td>

Observed datasets are Berkeley Earth (dark blue), CRU (brown),\nAPHRO-MA (light green) and JRA-55 (dark green). The filter is the same as that used in Figure 10.10.

Ensemble means are also shown. All trends are estimated using ordinary least-squares regression and box-and-whisker plots follow the\nmethodology used in Figure 10.6.
