The energy factor is the most important matter to manage climate-related carbon production. It is studied for the cases of energy-mix modeling which could give a mitigating method for global warming. Nuclear and renewable energies have very smaller carbon emissions in energy production. It is described in the modeling using event connections. However, there are side effects in these energies for mitigating carbon productions, which are analyzed by the modeling in this work such as the random number of generations decided by the expert&#8217;s judgments.</p>
