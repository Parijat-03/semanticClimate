<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0115">Addressing gender barriers and vulnerability that women face in their livelihoods pursuit is critical to establishing sustainable and resilient food systems, and their food security accordingly. The present paper put forward three important recommendations towards this endeavor. One, ensuring there is a strong gender lens in the food systems and food security paradigm by working with accurate sex-disaggregated data on individual level, and if possible disaggregated by other socio-economic characteristics such as age, race, class and geographical location. As indicated by <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Broussard (2019)</xref>, while there is a substantial amount of research on the different roles women play in food security nowadays, &#8216;relatively little attention has been paid to their own food security situation&#8217;. Many programme-based monitoring and evaluation approaches, as well as scientific research, don't go beyond collecting household data, if they even target households as a data-collection point. This is problematic as men remain heads of the household in many rural areas. Furthermore, those that make some effort remain largely instrumental - where a gender lens in projects and monitoring and evaluation is limited to numbers instead of context specifics. Women have a higher probability of being food insecure relative to men, therefore it is important to dive deeper into the factors that influence women's realities on an individual level, from both the perspectives of women being more food insecure and women being the primary local food producers.</p>
