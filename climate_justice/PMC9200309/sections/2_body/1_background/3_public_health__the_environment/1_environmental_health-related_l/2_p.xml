<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Relevant IEL statutes include &#8220;The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment&#8221; (the 1972 Stockholm Declaration) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and &#8220;The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development&#8221; (the Rio Earth Summit) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Inherent in both statutes is the legal mandate to prevent, wherever possible, the degradation or depletion of environmental resources needed to sustain planetary life. In both declarations, one can observe an anthropocentric focus on human health and the prevention of environmentally destructive actions which would be detrimental to it, namely those which interfere with life sustaining ecosystem services, as defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
