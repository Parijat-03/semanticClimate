<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The indices differentially prioritize urban versus rural vulnerabilities. Vulnerability in communities with low population densities is ranked the highest by SVI and the lowest by HHAI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240841.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, across indices, tracts with high population densities generally are more vulnerable. Among tracts in the top decile of population density, median vulnerability index percentile values are 75.0 (CES), 86.8 (HHAI) and 78.0 (SVI), while tracts in the bottom decile of population density have median vulnerability index percentile values of 35.7 (CES), 19.5 (HHAI), and 44.0 (SVI). HHAI includes three indicators that are important to characterizing urban-specific heat vulnerabilities but are less relevant for rural communities: impervious surface coverage, tree canopy coverage, and the change in urbanized land (<xref rid="pone.0240841.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SVI excludes environmental, pollution, and health related indicators, which may make it better able to characterize the drivers of vulnerability in low population density tracts (<xref rid="pone.0240841.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240841.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Beyond urban versus rural heat differences, the indices do not consider regional environmental and climatic differences that influence how communities experience heat and therefore how they should adapt. For example, prior work has shown that coastal winds can play a significant role in heat exposure for the inland tracts of the South Coast [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
