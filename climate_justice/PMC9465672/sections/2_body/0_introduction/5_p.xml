Furthermore, some of these vulnerable people are also negatively impacted by green grabbing (Fairhead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>). However, climate justice has been framed in diverse ways and no consensus has been achieved as to how and by whom prevention, mitigation, and adaptation costs must be paid to the most vulnerable populations (e.g., Schlosberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2012</xref>).</p>
