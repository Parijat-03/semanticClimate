<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par20">Within the identified literature, the majority of sources describe relational ontologies that can be broadly categorized as either undifferentiated or differentiated. Undifferentiated relational ontologies are monistic, viewing an entity as &#8220;an evolving expression of a metaphysical source&#8221; (Stout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2012</xref>, p. 389). Ecological holism is a form of undifferentiated relational ontology, for example, that dissolves the distinctions between mind, matter, and life in terms of more fundamental activities of the universe (Smuts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">1926</xref>). By contrast, differentiated relational ontologies view reality as an evolving unique expression of complex, relational, multidimensional sources (Stout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2012</xref>, p. 389). The latter conceives identity and difference in relation to each other, whereas the former assimilates differences in more fully encompassing forms of identity. The difference between undifferentiated and differentiated relational ontology is consequential for sustainability research. White et al.&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2016</xref>) comprehensive survey of hybrid theoretical approaches to society and nature demonstrates the importance of taking a differentiated relational approach, so as to understand the mutual relations between social and ecological systems without dichotomizing or subsuming one into the other.</p>
