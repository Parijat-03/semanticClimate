This updated framework has four main features. First, by expanding on and combining previously proposed frameworks, four major pathways driven by environmental changes generated by the climate crisis are described <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These pathways include extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, flooding, and heatwaves; sea level rise; changes in precipitation and temperature; and increased air pollution. Oftentimes, only the impact of extreme weather events on the delivery of HIV services is acknowledged as the main climate-related issue affecting HIV/AIDS, and other pathways are ignored. Second, the granular steps that connect major climate-related health phenomena and HIV/AIDs are identified in greater detail. As earlier mentioned, climate-related environmental phenomena do not have a direct effect on the virus or HIV/AIDS-related clinical outcomes. Instead, they create significant alterations in the proximal environment, social systems, and human behavior, which then lead to indirect effects on the HIV/AIDS epidemic <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While the diagram shows linear yet interconnected pathways for clarity, it is important to remember that in reality, these pathways and their different steps interact in complex and multidirectional ways.<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pathways Linking Climate Change and HIV/AIDS.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
