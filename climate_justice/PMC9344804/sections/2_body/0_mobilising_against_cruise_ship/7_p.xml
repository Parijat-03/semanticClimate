The entanglements between technical, political, and social fields can be seen in the case of Venice&#8217;s cruise protests. The concept of spatialization can be used to contextualize the power relations that manifest themselves in this process. Spatialization makes space its central focus and uses it to show the relationship between knowledge, power, discourse, and representation, which is also connected to the question of identity formation (cf. Kajetzke/Schroer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>: 10). Social conditions are constructed, shaped, and expressed in space. Space establishes order but is also characterized by action (Lefebvre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1991</xref>). Therefore, spatialization takes into account not only material dimensions and practices but also the ways in which these are discursively negotiated. My ethnographic research draws on participant observation during regular visits to Venice, analyses of press coverage and gray literature from the protest network, and informal conversations and interviews with activists, citizen campaigners, and the local population more broadly.</p>
