These features are often linked to physical and social-ecological processes that, although not unique to mountain regions, typify many of the special aspects of these regions. Due to their higher elevation compared with the surrounding landscape, mountains often feature cryosphere components, such as glaciers, snow cover and permafrost, with a signi&#64257;cant in&#64258;uence on surrounding lowland areas even far from the mountains (Huggel et al., 2015a). Hence the mountain cryosphere plays a major role in large parts of the world. Considering the close relationship between mountains and the cryosphere, high mountain areas are addressed in a dedicated chapter within this special report.
