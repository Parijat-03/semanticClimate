This lack of progress shows the impact of non-decision and delay and the invisibility of alternatives. The case thus reveals how MBMs can be used as a delaying tactic, knowing that the discussion will continue through several rounds of debate and technical argument about the form of the mechanisms. It could even be argued that the proposed 2 USD levy has created further delay, becoming a diversionary focus of discussion and even leading to a split among MBM proponents who fear that its adoption could replace the possibility of a tax at any significant level.</p>
