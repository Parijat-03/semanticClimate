The SUHI intensity for White prevalent tracts averaged and grouped by the city is over 1 K cooler than Black and Hispanic groupings, which is observable through the dot plots in <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. New Orleans, LA, has the highest mean yearly summertime SUHI intensity for both White and Black prevalent tracts. New Orleans is the second-ranked city for Hispanic communities, which are nearly 1 K warmer than their White or Black prevalent counterparts. However, as the city-averaged temperature for White prevalent groupings rapidly decreases, Black prevalent groupings do not. Seven cities are listed as more than 3 K hotter than their background temperature for associated White communities but there are more than 30 cities for Black, 50 for Hispanic, and 16 for Asian communities surpassing this 3 K threshold.</p>
