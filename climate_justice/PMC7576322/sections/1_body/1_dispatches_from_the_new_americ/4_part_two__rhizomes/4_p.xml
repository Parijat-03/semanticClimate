The account of Marilynn Wiggins illustrates an example of what it means to be a vulnerable citizen in the climate crisis. She details how the neighborhood in Pensacola, Florida that she resides, The Tanyard, is not only prone to floods, but is also home to an old sewage treatment plant and a mosquito control chemical plant. She explains how the neighborhood park was poisoned, and black dust comes from the water faucets in homes. Rush then discusses how this vulnerability becomes translated into risk by government agencies, researchers, and insurance companies. When the climate strikes and destroys homes, government regulations often force residents to rebuild new homes in the same vulnerable location as before, essentially throwing good money after bad.</p>
