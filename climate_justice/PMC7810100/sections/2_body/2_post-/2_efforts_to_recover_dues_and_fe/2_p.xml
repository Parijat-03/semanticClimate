The employees argue that they joined the union because the difference between union dues and fees was small and they chose membership in order to be able to access benefits available to members, for which fee payers were ineligible (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 11). Accordingly, these employees claim that they would not have joined the union if they were not otherwise required to pay fees for representation (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 11<italic>.</italic>) Again, courts have rejected the cases, both based on the good faith defense and because these employees voluntarily joined the union and accepted the benefits of that membership (Hodges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>, 11). They cannot now be heard to complain.</p>
