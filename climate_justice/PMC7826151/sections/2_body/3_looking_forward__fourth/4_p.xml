Today, these institutions are engaging in the promotion of dialogue and participation among visitors (Mazda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>); embracing socio-scientific issues as part of their exhibition practices (Kollmann&#160;et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>); creating more equitable relationships between visitors and museum professionals (Aguirre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>); and fostering scientific citizenship (Hine &amp; Medvecky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). Science museums that employ a range of science communication and public engagement models open up possibilities for creating spaces and practices that are critical and agential in both form and function.</p>
