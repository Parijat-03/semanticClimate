In May 2020 the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that without alternative income sources such as cash transfers by governments, the income loss from unemployment or underemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in an increase in relative poverty for informal workers and their families of more than 21 percentage points in upper-middle-income countries, almost 52 points in high-income countries, and 56 points in low-income countries (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">ILO, 2020</xref>). In an updated assessment released in January 2021, the ILO concluded that an equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs (based on a 48-h work week) were lost during 2020 (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">ILO, 2021</xref>).</p>
