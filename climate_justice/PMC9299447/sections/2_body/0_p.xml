<italic toggle="yes">Aboriginal people are the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we walk, work and live. It's important that we recognise their continued connection to the land, sea and community and acknowledge that this connection has extended over 60&#8201;000&#8201;years. Aboriginal people and their culture have continued to survive despite their ongoing trauma and experience by invasion and colonisation. For Aboriginal people in their communities, the impacts of climate change resembles the experiences of colonisation. When the first settlers [Europeans] invaded Australia, falsely and disrespectfully calling it terra nullius, no one's land, they bought with them many strangers carrying many diseases. Today, the man&#8208;made impacts of climate change are bringing a new form of disease to our country</italic> (Ronda Clarke in Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia hearing of the WA climate health public inquiry).<xref rid="jpc15649-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">
