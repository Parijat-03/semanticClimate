Recognition by the local state of already disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities or children from poor or ethnic minority backgrounds, is particularly challenging. The implication is that either state bodies need to change their routines and techniques significantly, or other organisations (charities, activists, etc.) that can offer the required recognition &#8211; and procedures &#8211; to enhance the capabilities to cycle and walk across <italic>all</italic> Londoners need strong support.</p>
