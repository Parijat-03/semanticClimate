      <td>Management of harmful air pollutants such as fine\nparticulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) also mitigate\nthe impacts of incomplete fossil fuel combustion and GHG\nemissions. In addition, management of pollutants such as\ntropospheric O3 has beneficial impacts on food production,\nsince O3 decreases crop production. Control of urban and\nindustrial air pollution would also mitigate the harmful\neffects of pollution and provide adaptation co-benefits via\nimproved human health. Management of pollution contrib-\nutes to aquatic ecosystem conservation since controlling\nair pollution, rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, acid\ndeposition, and industrial waste will reduce acidification\nof marine and freshwater ecosystems.</td>

      <td>Management of\ninvasive species/\nencroachment</td>
      <td>Agriculture and forests can be diverse, but often\nmuch of the diversity is non-native. Invasive species\nin different biomes have been introduced intentionally\nor unintentionally through export of ornamental plants\nor animals, and through the promotion of modern\nagriculture and forestry. Non-native species tend to\nbe more numerous in larger than in smaller human-\nmodified landscapes (e.g., over 50% of species in an\nurbanised area or extensive agricultural fields can be\nnon-native). Invasive alien species in the USA cause major\nenvironmental damage amounting to almost 120 billion\nUSD yr&#8211;1. There are approximately 50,000 foreign species\nand the number is increasing. About 42% of the species\non the Threatened or Endangered species lists are at\nrisk primarily because of alien-invasive species. Invasive\nspecies can be managed through manual clearance of\ninvasive species, while in some areas, natural enemies\nof the invasive species are introduced to control them.</td>
      <td>Exotic species are used in forestry where local indigenous\nforests cannot produce the type, quantity and quality of\nforest products required. Planted forests of exotic tree\nspecies make significant contributions to the economy\nand provide multiple products and Nature&#8217;s Contributions\nto People. In general, exotic species are selected to have\nhigher growth rates than native species and produce more\nwood per unit of area and time. In 2015, the total area of\nplanted forest with non-native tree species was estimated\nto be around 0.5 Mkm2. Introduced species were dominant\nin South America, Oceania and Eastern and Southern Africa,\nwhere industrial forestry is dominant. The use of exotic\ntree species has played an important role in the production\nof roundwood, fibre, firewood and other forest products.\nThe challenge is to manage existing and future plantation\nforests of alien trees to maximise current benefits, while\nminimising present and future risks and negative impacts,\nand without compromising future benefits. In many countries\nor regions, non-native trees planted for production or other\npurposes often lead to sharp conflicts of interest when\nthey become invasive, and to negative impacts on Nature&#8217;s\nContributions to People and nature conservation.</td>

      <td>Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded/\ndamaged coastal wetlands, including mangroves, salt\nmarshes and seagrass ecosystems.</td>
      <td>Coastal wetland restoration and avoided coastal wetland\nimpacts have the capacity to increase carbon sinks and can\nprovide benefits by regulating water flow and preventing\ndownstream flooding. Coastal wetlands provide a natural\ndefence against coastal flooding and storm surges by\ndissipating wave energy, reducing erosion and by helping to\nstabilise shore sediments. Since large areas of global coastal\nwetlands are degraded, restoration could provide benefits\nland degradation. Since some areas of coastal wetlands\nare used for food production, restoration could displace\nfood production and damage local food supply (Section\n6.3.4), though some forms (e.g., mangrove restoration)\ncan improve local fisheries.</td>

      <td>Restoration and\nreduced conversion\nof peatlands</td>
      <td>Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded/\ndamaged peatlands, which both increases carbon sinks,\nbut also avoids ongoing CO2 emissions from degraded\npeatlands. So, as well as protecting biodiversity, it both\nprevents future emissions and creates a sink.</td>
      <td>Avoided peat impacts and peatland restoration can provide\nsignificant mitigation, though restoration can lead to an\nincrease in methane emissions, particularly in nutrient rich\nfens. There may also be benefits for climate adaptation by\nregulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding.\nConsidering that large areas of global peatlands are\ndegraded, peatland restoration is a key tool in addressing\nland degradation. Since large areas of tropical peatlands\nand some northern peatlands have been drained and\ncleared for food production, their restoration could displace\nfood production and damage local food supply, potentially\nleading to adverse impacts on food security locally, though\nthe global impact would be limited due to the relatively\nsmall areas affected.</td>
