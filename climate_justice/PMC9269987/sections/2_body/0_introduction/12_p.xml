(2017)</xref> found that when people anticipated feeling <italic>pride</italic> due to their pro-environmental behavior, they had a higher pro-environmental intention than individuals without this anticipation. Additional to this direct effect, anticipated pride also mediated the effect of personal moral norms on pro-environmental intentions. Experienced pride in environmental behavior increased an individual&#8217;s engagement in pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Bissing-Olson et al., 2016</xref>). However, two types of pride can and should be distinguished: <italic>authentic</italic> and <italic>hubristic pride</italic>. Authentic pride, on the one hand, focuses on the &#8220;self-in-action,&#8221; e.g., pro-environmental behavior, and is therefore tied to specific situations. Hubristic pride, on the other hand, focuses on the &#8220;self-as-actor&#8221; and generalizes across situations. This difference impacts behavior: whereas authentic pride positively predicted moral behavior, hubristic pride was negatively related to it (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Krettenauer and Casey, 2015</xref>).</p>
