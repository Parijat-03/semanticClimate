It emerges when nutritional and food accessibility is not attainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Afghanistan has been struggling with acute and chronic food insecurity where 90% of its population live below the poverty line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), about 35% of its total population required urgent food and agricultural aid in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This deteriorating situation of food security is not the result of a single cause but numerous challenges and factors including conflict, natural disasters and climate changes, economic downturn, and now COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As COVID-19 has become the major public health concern of our time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is crucial to analyze its impact on socio-economic and food status besides health implications on the Afghan population. This paper aims to highlight the efforts of Afghanistan in alleviating food insecurity with a particular emphasis on the impact of COVID-19 on this issue. The paper also provides recommendations that may help improve the country&#8217;s food security during and after the pandemic.</p>
