To illustrate, the Koch Brothers spent some of their $80 billion in wealth on an extensive media campaign to discredit scientific research on environmental pollution (Mayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2017</xref>). Furthermore, during the 2019&#8211;2020 federal election cycle, the Koch Brothers&#8217; Super PAC, Americans for Prosperity Action, spent more than $47.7 million on federal elections in disclosed contributions compared to less than $41.5 million&#160;for all contributions by the largest 20 environmental organizations (Open Secrets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2020b</xref>). Moreover, historically, Americans for Prosperity Action has spent much more on undisclosed contributions (i.e., dark money), which reached $407 million during the 2012 federal election (Fang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>).</p>
