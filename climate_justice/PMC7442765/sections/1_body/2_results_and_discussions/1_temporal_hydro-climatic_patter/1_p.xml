<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">The mean monthly lake levels and their standard deviations from 1899 to 2017 are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The lake levels peak at the end of the rain season between March and May (about 474.25 m ASVD). This peak is followed by a recession with minimum levels occurring between October and December (about 473.36 m ASVD). These two extremes give lake level range of about 1 m. The standard deviation pattern closely follows the mean lake levels.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Monthly mean levels of Lake Malawi and their standard deviations during 1899 to 2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
