Access to healthy food options can help populations maintain health in a preventative fashion [<xref rid="B85-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and Hilmers, Hilmers, and Dave identified potential public health hazards for &#8220;low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations&#8221; with regard to their ability to make health dietary decisions and to manage a healthy body weight due to a lack of access [<xref rid="B85-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] (p. 1652). As food production shifts locally, nationally, and globally due to temperature and precipitation changes, costs and accessibility of quality foods for all communities may be stressed even further. This stress will likely put an additional burden on low-income, minority, and remote communities to acquire healthy and affordable nutritional options. </p>
