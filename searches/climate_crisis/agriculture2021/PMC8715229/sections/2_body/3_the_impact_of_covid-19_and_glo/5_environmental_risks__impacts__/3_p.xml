<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0320">COVID-19 is part of a growing list of zoonotic diseases that includes HIV, SARS, MERS, and Ebola, among others. The race to increase agricultural production has led to an intensification and homogenization of agricultural activities. This together with other environmental changes plays in important role in the risk of emerging zoonotic diseases (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013</xref>). Demographic changes, urbanization, and land-use changes have pushed further into natural frontiers and fragmented habitats (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">IPBES, 2019</xref>). While the relationship between biodiversity and emerging diseases is complex (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2017</xref>), habitat degradation by human land-uses have broken down barriers, and together with the increase in livestock units and their concentration have allowed viruses and bacteria to spill over more easily from wildlife to domestic animals and/or humans (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). The consumption and trade of wildlife further aid the spread of zoonotic diseases (<xref rid="bb0640" ref-type="bibr">Walzer, 2020</xref>).</p>
