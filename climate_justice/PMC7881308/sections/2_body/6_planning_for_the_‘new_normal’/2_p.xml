Clinics should prioritise the delivery of services to groups who have limited opportunities to advocate effectively for themselves. Clinics also have an important role to play in educating our communities about the legal dimensions of effectively responding to issues raised by the pandemic. Street Law and community legal education initiatives will be important in developing legal literacy across communities that have been heavily impacted by COVID19.</p>
