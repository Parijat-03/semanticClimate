<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Exposure to other extreme weather events, such as storms or floods, can have direct effects such as injuries and deaths, although these effects are currently less frequent in urban environments with a Mediterranean climate. These events can also produce post-traumatic stress, acute stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health problems, often leading to more than one problem at a time [<xref rid="B78-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These mental health problems can, moreover, increase medication use, intake of other substances, such as alcohol, and the number of suicides [<xref rid="B79-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. For example, in several Mediterranean climate areas, including Italy, Greece and California, an increase in psychiatric consultations and suicides was observed in relation to high extreme temperatures [<xref rid="B80-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Social cohesion and social support networks can also be affected, impairing mental health and wellbeing [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B83-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Finally, extreme climate events can increase respiratory problems (for example, due to exposure to mould in flood-damaged buildings) and diarrhoea.</p>
