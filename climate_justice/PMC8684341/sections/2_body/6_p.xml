I get the point. We need to find solutions in all of the &#8220;loaded guns&#8221; (Fajardo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>: 1)&#8212;the legal weaponry where struggles might find leverage over power. But, as a rule (one might say, &#8220;as a rule of law&#8221;), human rights will not save us. Neither will the UN. I am influenced, here, by my own empirical studies with my colleague Stefanie (Khoury and Whyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>), but also by the outcome of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, which is coming to a close as I write this. Despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report published before the conference (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2021</xref>) reasserting the need for outcomes that tie the big carbon producers to measures that can keep the world to a 1.5&#160;&#176;C rise by 2100&#8212;and despite the International Energy Agency (IEA) stressing the need to abandon all exploration and all new fossil fuel projects (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>)&#8212;COP26 got nowhere near the measures needed to achieve this. Instead, the best estimates predict that we are heading for a catastrophic rise of 2.4 &#176;C by 2100 (and this is even if we manage to meet <italic>all</italic> of the Glasgow targets). Glasgow did little more than consolidate a market definition of &#8220;zero&#8221; carbon that will keep fossil fuels being produced well beyond 2050 (Whyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>). This is the UN.</p>
