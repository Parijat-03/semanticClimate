<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0165">In countries with no dedicated structures and laws to address CM and MR, the need for a transformative justice approach is even more necessary. For some countries, this may mean creating two separate legal structures or a robust one to handle both MR and CM. For example, New Zealand plans to create a new law and funding structure for MR (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Daalder, 2020</xref>) while also considering &#8220;an experimental humanitarian visa&#8221; category for climate migrants seeking entrance into their country (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Fiennes, 2019</xref>). Australia and New Zealand also have in place international labor migration programs which may be expanded to include climate-related migration. In the US, Representative Nydia Vel&#225;zquez (D-NY) has proposed &#8220;The Climate Displaced Person&#8217;s Act&#8221; (H.R. 4732) which aims to welcome up to 50,000 CDPs per year to the United States (<xref rid="b0630" ref-type="bibr">Vel&#225;quez, 2019</xref>). These examples show different institutional arrangements and proposed pathways to achieving climate justice for frontline communities. Should these efforts fail, the world may have to create a new legally-binding multilateral convention with comprehensive rights that supports the migration, relocation, and resettlement of CDPs. Ideally, this treaty will have similar recognition and impact as the 1951 Refugee Convention. For this to happen, current politics of fear and securitization of migration must give way to bold leadership, collective action, and transnational solidarity.</p>
