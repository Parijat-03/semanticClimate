For example, supply chains of developing countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia rely heavily on human capital and access to local and informal markets. Hence, containment measures can represent a considerable threat to the supply of food staples and lead to rising local food prices in these regions. Food price volatility in the past has been recognized as trigger for food insecurity, political instability and unrest, and hence flagged as a national security concern (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix, 2016</xref>). In 2020, price spikes were observed locally due to the impact of travel bans, closure of markets, and other measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, as <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al. (2020)</xref> highlight for example in their discussion of the situation in West Africa.</p>
