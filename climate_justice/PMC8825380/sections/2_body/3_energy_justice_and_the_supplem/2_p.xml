Recall that Sen discussed the capability approach as providing opportunities substantial to achieve freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>). Energy consumption per capita relates to infant mortality, female life expectancy, and political freedom, in addition to HDI (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 347), which all affects agents&#8217; capabilities. While the relation between energy use and HDI most likely requires taking other components into consideration, for the sake of simplicity we will limit the discussion to energy use as a prerequisite for capabilities.</p>
