<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">On the day of sentencing, an Indigenous elder argued to the judge that the boy standing on unceded aboriginal land did not constitute a criminal act. The &#8220;<italic>crime scene</italic>,&#8221; she contended, was the one unfolding in the courtroom &#8211; defying the rights of Indigenous people to preserve and protect land and water, which was the boy's stated intent. The judge did not take issue with the claim that the boy was only praying peacefully, but asserted that being on this road constituted &#8220;criminal contempt&#8221; of his injunction. He added that he could not fathom a successful challenge and that there can be no Indigenous rights defence because white people of European descent had also been arrested under the injunction; this nullified, for him, the idea that Indigenous rights needed any particular attention here. The elder argued that the boy should not be deemed &#8220;guilty&#8221; of anything, that forced appearance at nine court proceedings, causing repeated sleepless nights and anxiety, was already more than enough punishment, and that the &#8220;criminal contempt&#8221; label needed to be appealed, with the pipeline violating Indigenous people's rights on land never ceded to the British colonisers before the creation of Canada nor to any Canadian government thereafter. She added that the boy did not know what an &#8220;injunction&#8221; even was at the time of arrest, should not have been tried in adult court, and should not be punished for opposing a violation of Indigenous laws and values.</p>
