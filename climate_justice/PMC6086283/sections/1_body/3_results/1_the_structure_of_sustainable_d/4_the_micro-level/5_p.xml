<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par29">This latter aspect is reinforced in the Encyclical. Pope Francis &#8220;calls for greater attention to local cultures when studying environmental problems, favoring a dialogue between scientific-technical language and the language of the people. Culture is [&#8230;] a living, dynamic and participatory present reality, which cannot be excluded as we rethink the relationship between human beings and the environment&#8221; (Enc., 143). Thus, micro-level norms rely not only on &#8220;scientific information&#8221; (Enc., 210) but considerably on &#8220;ecological conversion&#8221; (Enc., 216-221). The individual &#8220;desire to change&#8221; does not depend on top-down dissemination of information from the &#8220;global stocktake&#8221;. Rather micro-level norms in the Encyclical express the individual exigency &#8220;to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it&#8221; (Enc.,19). Nevertheless, the Encyclical acknowledges the need for &#8220;objective&#8221; and &#8220;new information&#8221; and non-ideological assessment (Enc., 186, 187). But its complementary approach to scientific findings remains a deeply individual and ethical knowledge of individual responsibility. Hence the Encyclical does not lay emphasis on &#8220;infinite capacities for activism&#8221; (SDGs, 51) based on global information. Instead it highlights relative to the UN norms a provoking and subversive ethics, which &#8220;protects human action from becoming empty activism&#8221; (Enc., 237).</p>
