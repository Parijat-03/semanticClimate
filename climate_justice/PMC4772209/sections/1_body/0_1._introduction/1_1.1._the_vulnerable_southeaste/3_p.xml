There are varying definitions of what it means to be &#8220;rural.&#8221; The U.S. Census Bureau identifies a rural area to consist of all &#8220;territories, populations, and housing units located outside urbanized areas and urban clusters (<italic>i.e.</italic>, densely populated areas containing more than 50,000 or more than 2500 people, respectively)&#8221; [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At least one-third of the populations in 7 out of the 10 states comprising the Southeastern U.S. live in an area considered rural by the U.S. Census Bureau [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Southeastern U.S. is comprised of over 90% rural land area [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. People who live in rural areas in the Southeast currently do and will continue to experience climate change in unique ways by virtue of regional changes in temperature, precipitation, and severe weather events and their vulnerable status [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p>
