<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Many governments, non-governmental actors, and communities are interested in addressing disparities in climate impacts and supporting adaptation for those most at risk. In some places, there are emerging efforts to implement equity-oriented adaptation policies. The state of California is one such example. Currently, the state is mandated by law to delegate 25% of its funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities identified through a vulnerability index called CalEnviroScreen 3.0 (CES) [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because equity-oriented climate adaptation is an emerging priority, this is an especially important moment to evaluate the state&#8217;s approach and consider alternatives. We explore the implications of using vulnerability indices to guide equity-oriented adaptation by considering three key issues: 1) how assessed vulnerability differs depending on the vulnerability index used, 2) how extreme heat risk compares among communities across definitions of exposure and vulnerability, and 3) how adaptation projects are distributed across communities at risk from extreme heat.</p>
