The absence of adequate governance in many countries can lead to harsh working conditions and unregulated disposal of electronic waste. Digitalisation also affects firms&#8217; competitiveness, the demand for skills, and the distribution of, and access to resources. The existing digital divide, especially in developing countries, and the lack of appropriate governance of the digital revolution can hamper the role that digitalisation could play in supporting the achievement of stringent mitigation targets. At present, the understanding of both the direct and indirect impacts of digitalisation on energy use, carbon emissions and potential mitigation is limited (</span><span style="x0: 466.2; x1: 473.06; y0: 582.61; y1: 592.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="466.2" y0="582.61" x1="536.51">medium&#160;confidence</span><span x0="536.51" y0="582.61" x1="543.36" style="x0: 536.51; x1: 539.16; y0: 582.61; y1: 592.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.4" top="558.62"><span x0="65.2" y0="558.62" x1="543.4" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The digital transformation is a&#160;megatrend that is fundamentally changing all economies and societies, albeit in very different ways depending on the level of development of a&#160;given country and on the nature of its economic system. Digital technologies have significant potential to contribute to decarbonisation due to their ability to increase energy and material efficiency, make transport and building systems less wasteful, and improve the access to services for consumers and citizens. Yet, if left unmanaged, the digital transformation will probably increase energy demand, exacerbate inequities and the concentration of power, leaving developing economies with less access to digital technologies behind, raise ethical issues, reduce labour demand and compromise citizens&#8217; welfare. Appropriate governance of the digital transformation can ensure that digitalisation works as an enabler, rather than as a&#160;barrier and further strain in decarbonisation pathways. Governance can ensure that digitalisation not only reduces GHG emissions intensity but also contributes to reducing absolute GHG emission, constraining run-away consumption. {Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11 in Chapter&#160;16, 16.2} </span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.43" top="426.63"><span x0="65.2" y0="426.63" x1="543.43" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 426.63; y1: 436.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Digital technologies have the potential to reduce energy demand in all end-use sectors through steep improvements in energy efficiency. This includes material input savings and increased coordination as they allow the use of fewer inputs to perform a&#160;given task. Smart appliances and energy management, supported by choice architectures, economic incentives and social norms, effectively reduce energy demand and associated GHG emissions by 5&#8211;10% while maintaining equal service levels. Data centres can also play a&#160;role in energy-system management, for example by waste-heat utilisation where district heat systems are close by; temporal and spatial scheduling of electricity demand can provide about 6% of the total potential demand response. {5.5, Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11, Table&#160;1 in Chapter&#160;16}</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.46" top="330.65"><span x0="65.2" y0="330.65" x1="543.46" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 330.65; y1: 340.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Digital technologies, analytics and connectivity consume large amounts of energy, implying higher direct energy demand and related carbon emissions. Global energy demand from digital appliances reached 7.14 EJ in 2018. The demand for computing services increased by 550% between 2010 and 2018 and is now estimated at 1% of global electricity consumption. Due to efficiency improvements, the associated energy demand increased only modestly, by about 6% from 2000 to 2018. {Box&#160;9.5}</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.37" top="270.65"><span x0="65.2" y0="270.65" x1="543.37" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 270.65; y1: 280.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">System-wide effects endanger energy and GHG-emission savings. Rising demand can diminish energy savings, and also produce run-away effects associated with additional consumption and GHG emissions if left unregulated. Savings are varied in smart and shared mobility systems, as ride-hailing increases GHG emissions due to deadheading, whereas shared pooled mobility and shared cycling reduce GHG emissions, as occupancy levels and/or weight per person kilometre transported improve. Systemic effects have wider boundaries of analysis and are more difficult to quantify and investigate but are nonetheless very relevant. Systemic effects tend to have negative impacts, but policies and adequate infrastructures and choice architectures can help manage and contain these. {5.3, 5.4, 5.6}</span></div></body></html>
