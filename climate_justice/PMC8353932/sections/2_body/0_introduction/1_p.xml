Since its establishment in 1988, the IPCC has evolved over time from something like an ad hoc, small panel of government-appointed scientists into a full-fledged 'international bureaucracy' (De Pryck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>) that carries out multi-year cycle, comprehensive assessments about scientific knowledge on climate change. IPCC reports are now arguably considered the most authoritative voice of climate science. The IPCC has built its epistemic authority through painstaking efforts for the making of intergovernmental expert consensus (De Pryck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>), which is guided by its own institutional mantra of so-called &#8216;policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive&#8217; advice. Such consensus-making and the guise of political neutrality renders to the IPCC a <italic>symbolic</italic> power&#8212;the power to make people see and believe, and hence act on, the world (Hughes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>; see also Beck and Mahony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>).</p>
