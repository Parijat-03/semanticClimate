Under a 2&#160;&#176;C warming scenario, accumulated costs of damages from warming to global aggregate economic growth may be as high as USD 69 trillion by 2100.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> This remains as high as USD 54 trillion under a 1.5&#160;&#176;C warming scenario (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). Overall, the global economy could be impacted by an additional 10% loss in GDP by 2050 if commitments in the Paris agreement are not met (Swiss Re Institute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>). Impact related costs fall disproportionately on developing countries (Black <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>). Economies in south and southeast Asia are particularly vulnerable to adverse climate related effects&#8212;for example, analysis by Swiss Re points to losses of 33&#8211;36% of GDP by 2048 for Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines under a 2&#8211;2.6&#160;&#176;C warming scenario. By contrast, many advanced economies are less vulnerable, characterised by lower exposure levels and higher capacities to respond (Swiss Re Institute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>). Kikstra et al.&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>) analysis projects deteriorating growth trajectories in Africa, Latin America and South Asia as a result of climate change. Further, Cevik and Jalles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2022</xref>) report that vulnerability and resilience to climate change have a significant impact on the cost of government borrowing, all else being equal, further exacerbating risks for countries in the global south.</p>
