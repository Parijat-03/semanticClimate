<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Chilean air quality (AQ) monitoring network (<uri xlink:href="https://sinca.mma.gob.cl">https://sinca.mma.gob.cl</uri>, accessed on 24 May 2021) has a total of 28 stations with PM<sub>2.</sub><sub>5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> data available for the year 2016. The location of the stations varies from completely urban to small isolated cities, and their latitudes range between 45&#176; S and 33&#176; S. The annual PM<sub>2.</sub><sub>5</sub> concentrations for the available stations range from 11 to 67 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>, being higher for the higher latitudes where firewood heating is predominantly used and where maximum daily values can reach up to 500 &#956;g/m<sup>3</sup>. For PM<sub>10</sub>, the observed concentrations range from 20 to 87 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> and maximum daily averages reach up to 530 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>. Contrary to PM<sub>2.</sub><sub>5</sub> which, in general, shows a gradient of increasing concentrations with increasing latitude, PM<sub>10</sub> does not present the same variability, suggesting different emission profiles among cities in central and southern Chile.</p>
