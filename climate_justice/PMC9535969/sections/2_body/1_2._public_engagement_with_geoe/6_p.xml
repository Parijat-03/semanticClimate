There is limited public knowledge about these technologies: according to <xref rid="bibr20-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Mercer et al. (2011)</xref>, who conducted the first large-scale international survey of public perception of geoengineering in 2010 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, only 8% of respondents could define &#8216;geoengineering&#8217;. <xref rid="bibr21-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Merk et al. (2015)</xref> confirmed this tendency in Germany, noting that public awareness of geoengineering &#8216;remains low&#8217; (p. 300). Hence, ignorance plays a significant role in lay discussions. Participants often use analogies or compare geoengineering with more familiar technologies, emphasizing their ignorance and unease (<xref rid="bibr34-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2017</xref>), arguing that research seems uncertain, doubting whether scientists will ever have enough knowledge to justify these interventions (<xref rid="bibr9-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
