We calculate the climate change-attributed portion of depths and damages by subtracting flooding data from the scenarios with less precipitation from the baseline flood that occurred. Here, we present results for the two &#8220;best estimates&#8221;; a lower scenario of 20% less precipitation without climate change (the &#8220;best estimate&#8221; from ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and similar to the multigroup best estimate average of 19% from ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>), and a higher one of 38% less precipitation (the &#8220;best small-region estimate&#8221; from ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). Results for the other five scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Information in Tables&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref>.
