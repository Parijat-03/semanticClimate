In fact, it is a huge honor that five of my colleagues, who are all doing vital work in this area, have actually read it. The idea of this multiple review format was originally proposed as a virtual &#8220;author-meets-critics&#8221; forum. As Avi Brisman, the Editor-in-Chief of this journal said, if not for COVID 19, we would be meeting and debating things like this face-to-face. Having this discussion on those pages is, for me, a very special second best.</p>
