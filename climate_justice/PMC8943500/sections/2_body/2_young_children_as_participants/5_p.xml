Early childhood education could and should be at the very centre of a dialogue between various generations, stakeholders, and groups in society (Elliott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Education in the early years is a powerful arena for development of values, attitudes, and behaviours. It holds a space for creating understandings of ourselves in the world, our relationships to ourselves, other humans, but also to the more-than-human world (Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>; Wals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>). Thus, it can shape both our contemporary world and our future. When approaching ECEfS, the environmental dimension is often the starting point but also the main priority (Engdahl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>). The social, cultural, and economic as well as political dimensions are addressed to a lesser degree. Studies show that there is still uncertainty among staff in ECEC considering the implementation of ECEfS (Huggins &amp; Evans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Against this background, this special issue seeks to promote the dialogue by making visible research that is conducted in a variety of contexts and thus contributes to the knowledge on ECEfS in relation to the SDGs.</p>
