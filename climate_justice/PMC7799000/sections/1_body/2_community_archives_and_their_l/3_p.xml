<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">My last point is an example from my research. White Rock Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, was a pivotal black church. They had begun North Carolina Central Farmers Mechanics Bank and other black social and business institutions. If the church created a community archive and maintained those things for a little while and then built a relationship with wherever those items finally wind up, that's a different type of relationship, a different perspective on the narrative. And there's an engagement with the community. The only way to build that trust is to teach the community how to collect and archive items themselves.</p>
