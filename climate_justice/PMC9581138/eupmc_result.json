Many projects and initiatives have produced high quality scientific results by mobilizing peoples' interest in science to volunteer for the public good. Few studies have attempted to map citizen science as a field, and assess its impact on science, society and ways to sustain its future practice. To better understand CS activities and characteristics, CS Track employs an analytics and analysis framework for monitoring the citizen science landscape. Within this framework, CS Track collates and processes information from project websites, platforms and social media and generates insights on key issues of concern to the CS community, such as participation patterns or impact on science learning. In this paper, we present the operationalization of the CS Track framework and its three-level analysis approach (micro-meso-macro) for applying analytics techniques to external data sources. We present three case studies investigating the CS landscape using these analytical levels and discuss the strengths and limitations of combining web-analytics with quantitative and qualitative research methods. This framework aims to complement existing methods for evaluating CS, address gaps in current observations of the citizen science landscape and integrate findings from multiple studies and methodologies. Through this work, CS Track intends to contribute to the creation of a measurement and evaluation scheme for CS and improve our understanding about the potential of analytics for the evaluation of CS.", "affiliation": "MOFET Institute - Research Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["brief-report", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Content analysis", "Citizen Science", "Social Networks Analysis", "Social Science Analysis", "Web-Based Analytics"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2022.988544"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9581138"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9581138?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2022-10-24", "firstIndexDate": "2022-10-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-10-21", "dateOfRevision": "2022-10-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-10-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-10-05"}
