Chinese &#8216;green finance&#8217; policies have built upon collaborative studies between Chinese institutions and international, including European, partners. These included the China&#8217;s Green Finance Task Force (GFTF), a collaboration of the PBOC and the UNEP Inquiry, which culminated in 2015 (Elliott and Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>, 396&#8211;97), and the collaboration between State Council researchers, the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the UNEP Inquiry and Norway&#8217;s Fridtjof Nansen Institute (Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2019</xref>, 216&#8211;17). The PBoC/UNEP report itemised various EU and Member State laws and initiatives as positive examples (PBoC/UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>, 8ff). Elliott and Zhang, who analysed the network of Chinese and foreign actors participating in these collaborations, concluded that the GFTF process &#8216;facilitated transnational policy diffusion via collaborative social construction &#8230; and learning&#8217; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>, 397).</p>
