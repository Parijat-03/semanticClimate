As faculty at a land grant institution, I can engage in public dialogue with Extension leadership and Extension agents about values and partners, including writing this essay, and work with them to discuss possibilities for alternative programs and implementation; organize forums with participants representing different Extension institutions, interested faculty, and community partners to discuss Extension&#8217;s contradictory history and its potential as a platform for transformative engagement; work through shared governance, faculty alliances, and community networks to build a coalition to institutionalize a new vision for Extension; and lobby university administrators, local, regional, state, and national political leaders to embrace a liberatory vision.</p>
