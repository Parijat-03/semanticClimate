After five months, one participant had become a sustained activist in a local organization. The interviews suggested that poor participation was overwhelmingly due to Zoom fatigue and the participants' perception that the Zoom format precluded typical social interactions. This opened the question of whether the intervention was weak due to this lack of social interaction or to the absence of change in the other eight psychological factors. Therefore, after the Registered Report Stage 1 In-Principle Acceptance and with the editor's permission, we ran an exploratory follow-up study with an in-person intervention where participants watched the videos in a social setting and could participate in on-campus activism events.</p>
