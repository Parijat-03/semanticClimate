We then examine the extent to which these drivers overlap with those affecting ethnic Bengali women from poor and middle-income groups and assess the implications of relatively greater personal freedoms &#8211; for example, strong mobility experienced by Santal women &#8211; for their ability to reach out to ethnic Bengali women and help them collectively seize control over development processes.</p>
