Adaptation can be either anticipatory (occurring prior to experiencing effects of climate change) or responsive (resultant from climate change effects already occurring) [<xref rid="B96-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Local climate change mitigation efforts may include fundraising for and installation of solar panel farms in support of low-emission, clean-energy power sources. An example of a local adaptive measure to reduce flooding related to climate change is the creation of a sea wall along a beach-front property. Where mitigation approaches naturally take place at all levels <italic>(i.e</italic>., local, regional, national, international), oftentimes adaptation to climate change occurs at the local or regional level [<xref rid="B97-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that mitigation and adaptation are not mutually exclusive as the two are inherently linked [<xref rid="B97-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].</p>
