SI&#160;in intensively farmed areas may require a&#160;reduction in production in favour of increasing sustainability in the broad sense (Buckwell et al. 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;6 in Chapter 5). Hence, moving towards sustainability may imply lower yield growth rates than those maximally attainable in such situations. For areas that contain valuable natural ecosystems, such as the primary forest in the Congo basin, intensi&#64257;cation of agriculture is one of the pillars of the strategy to conserve forest (Vanlauwe et al. 2014). Intensi&#64257;cation in agriculture is recognised as one of the pathways to meet food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation goals (Sapkota et al. 2017c). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="231.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 231.54; y1: 241.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="231.54" x1="307.6">However, SI does not always confer co-bene&#64257;ts in terms of food security and climate change adaption/mitigation. For example, in the case of Vietnam, intensi&#64257;ed production of rice and pigs reduced GHG emissions in the short term through land sparing, but after two decades, the emissions associated with higher inputs were likely to outweigh the savings from land sparing (Thu Thuy et al. 2009). Intensi&#64257;cation needs to be sustainable in all components of food system by curbing agricultural sprawl, rebuilding soils, restoring degraded lands, reducing agricultural pollution, increasing water use ef&#64257;ciency, and decreasing the use of external inputs (Cook et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="99.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 99.56; y1: 109.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="99.56" x1="307.57">A study conducted by Palm et al.

Further, adoption of high-input forms of agriculture under the guise of simultaneously improving yields and environmental performance will attract more investment leading to higher rate of adoption but with the environmental component of SI quickly abandoned (Godfray 2015). Where adopted, SI needs to engage with the sustainable development agenda to (i) identify SI agricultural practices that strengthen rural communities, improve smallholder livelihoods and employment, and avoid negative social and cultural impacts, including loss of land tenure and forced migration; (ii) invest in the social, &#64257;nancial, natural, and physical capital needed to facilitate SI implementation; and (iii) develop mechanisms to pay poor farmers for undertaking sustainability measures (e.g.,&#160;GHG emissions mitigation or biodiversity protection) that may carry economic costs (Garnett et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="123.61"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 123.61; y1: 133.11; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="123.61" x1="566.09">In summary, integrated agricultural systems and practices can enhance food system resilience to climate change and reduce GHG emissions, while helping to achieve sustainability (</span><span style="x0: 499.34; x1: 503.92; y0: 99.61; y1: 109.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="499.34" y0="99.61" x1="556.34">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 556.34; x1: 558.98; y0: 99.61; y1: 109.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="556.34" y0="99.61" x1="563.19">). </span></div><div left="374.57" right="246.97" top="492.93"><span style="x0: 374.57; x1: 377.07; y0: 492.93; y1: 501.9; width: 2.49; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.294, 0.234, 0.228, 0.12]; font-family: ACEKPB+FrutigerLTStd-BoldCn;" x0="374.57" y0="492.93" x1="246.97">Intensi&#64257;cationExtensi&#64257;cation</span></div><div left="272.51" right="352.99" top="579.24"><span style="x0: 272.51; x1: 276.49; y0: 579.24; y1: 588.21; width: 3.98; font-size: 8.96; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.294, 0.234, 0.228, 0.12]; font-family: ACCPHD+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="272.51" y0="579.24" x1="352.99">The size of the window of opportunity for SI is system speci&#64257;c and may shift over time</span></div></body></html>
