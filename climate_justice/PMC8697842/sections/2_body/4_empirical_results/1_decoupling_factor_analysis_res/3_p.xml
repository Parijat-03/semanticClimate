Only in the periods 1990&#8211;1991, 1991&#8211;1992, 1994&#8211;1995, 2000&#8211;2001, and 2014&#8211;2015, did re-coupling of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income occur in the country. Australia&#8217;s real income increased annually, by an average of 3.1% between 1990 and 2017. In addition, the annual average increase in its emissions was calculated as 1.5% for the same period. Therefore, a relative decoupling was observed between the country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> and real income in the studied period. In the periods where re-coupling was experienced, the economic growth rate was smaller than that of emissions. The decoupling factor results between Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income are presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Decoupling factor results of Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> and real income over 1990&#8211;2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12053_2021_10014_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
