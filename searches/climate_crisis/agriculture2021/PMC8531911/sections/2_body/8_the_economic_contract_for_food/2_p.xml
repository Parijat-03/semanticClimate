This vision began to erode as the US organized the Cold War world order&#8212;reconstructing post-war Western Europe with commercial agro-technologies, overriding UN proposals to establish a World Food Board by developing its own bilateral food aid programmes in the 1950s, and exporting green revolution technology to select Third World states in the 1960s (Canfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>).</p>
