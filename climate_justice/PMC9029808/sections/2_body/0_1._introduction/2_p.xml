People&#8217;s vulnerability to climate change is highly dependent on the contextual challenges of certain regions and population groups, due to continuing historical patterns of inequity linked to gender, age, ethnicity, low income, and colonialism [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the IPCC, &#8220;global hotspots of high human vulnerability are found in particular in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, Small Island Developing States and the Arctic&#8221;, as well as in locations of high poverty and limited access to basic services and resources [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evidence shows that &#8220;between 2010&#8211;2020, human mortality from floods, droughts, and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability&#8221; [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These regions are also where the largest absolute number of people displaced by climate change can be found [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies show that poorer households are often more likely to live in locations highly exposed to extreme heat and air pollution, and are more likely to be forced to migrate [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
