<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A set of <em>well-mixed greenhouse gases</em> with long atmospheric <em>lifetimes</em>.</p>
<p>This set of compounds includes <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> and <em>nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</em>, together with some halogenated compounds. They have a warming effect on <em>climate</em>. These compounds accumulate in the <em>atmosphere</em> at decadal to centennial time scales, and their effect on climate hence persists for decades to centuries after their emission. On time scales of decades to a century, already emitted emissions of long-lived climate forcers can only be abated by greenhouse gas removal.</p>
