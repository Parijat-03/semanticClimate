Spencer and Brooks have found that &#8216;reflective writing is not innate and that it must be taught. It is not enough to merely ask students to reflect without defining what is actually required in that process.&#8217;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn42">42</xref> They have used a &#8216;Critical Incident Report&#8217; to introduce students to reflective writing.
