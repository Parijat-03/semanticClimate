As we outlined in the Introduction, we expected gratitude for privileges to be a generalized emotion shaping behavior (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Landmann, 2020</xref>). Currently, there is not much literature on the role of gratitude in pro-environmental behavior. Yet, this finding potentially challenges a recent finding on the positive effect of gratitude on pro-environmental intention (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Tam, 2022</xref>). This may be rooted in Tam&#8217;s concept of gratitude, which can also be regarded as a trait but directly refers to gratitude toward nature rather than one&#8217;s own privileges in the face of climate injustice. Gratitude toward nature is similar to and associated with connectedness to nature, which also is a positive predictor of pro-environmental behavior (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kals and Maes, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Tam, 2022</xref>). Contrary to gratitude toward nature, gratitude toward one&#8217;s own privileges requires a high level of reflectiveness as one has to not take comfortable benefits for granted (e.g., mobile devices whose batteries are manufactured under exploitative working conditions and water pollution; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Wanger, 2011</xref>).</p>
