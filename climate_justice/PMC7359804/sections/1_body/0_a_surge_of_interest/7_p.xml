(2020)</xref> call state-centric to society-centric research on justice in transport and mobilities. The former concentrates on planning and policy as well as questions of equity, or the distribution of benefits and costs, harms, and risks associated with particular decisions, actions, and changes by state actors. The latter tends to consider a broader range of actors, practices, and knowledges. It expands the idea of what planning is outside the traditional institutional domain and considers social movements, community organisations, NGOs and charities, activism, participatory action research, and processes in which citizen collectives actively shape planning, either through collaboration with official planning actors such as state organisations and/or the private sector, or by contesting their actions and initiating alternative planning processes (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Nixon and Schwanen, 2019</xref>). Society-centric studies recognise that states have a critical role to play in achieving transport/mobility justice but are mindful of the myriad ways in which state action generates or furthers injustices.</p>
