When conducting eco-social and equity informed research, it becomes clear that in order to advance work which connects climate change adaptation and mitigation, community resilience building and the provision of supports and interventions for the mental health of children and youth, collaborations between a range of new and unusual allies is required. Asset-based Community Development (ABCD) approaches offer one way to engage in this work as it focuses on identifying and leveraging community priorities and assets, conducting research, generating new knowledge, and repeating the process while engaging with the community and building relationships throughout.</p>
