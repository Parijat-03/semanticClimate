[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:15:39
Beautiful. Oh, beautiful transcript. No, okay. Oh, okay.

[Nitika Baghel] 11:15:43
Yeah. Right, so on the bottom you'll see your same transcript. You'll have to click on that when the meeting is about to end just before you end the meeting.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:15:45
Let's do that. Let's see. That's fine. View.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:15:47
Good.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:15:55
Brilliant. That's absolutely what we want. Okay. So we need a discipline at the end that we save our transcription.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:04
That we save our recording. And then we, Close to screen sharing and then we end the session, right?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:14
Okay. Right, this is hopefully the last, major bit that I'm going to create.

[Renu Kumari] 11:16:17
Okay. Yeah.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:22
All this. document. I just want to

[Renu Kumari] 11:16:24
Okay.

[Renu Kumari] 11:16:27
Peter, you've not switched on the recording.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:30
Oh, is it not switched on? Oh, okay.

[Renu Kumari] 11:16:32
No, no.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:45
Okay. Right, well done. Excellent. Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:16:52
So this is, Apart which will come probably partly at the end. And partly at the beginning.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:02
And he wants to, it's going to deal with the technology of creating, semantic material automatically from non-smantic material.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:14
But I just want to say a little bit about the history and, where what we're doing fits into.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:23
The general development of information. Now, what we are doing is actually quite Revolution. But, it built from a concept which was popularized by Vannevar Bush.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:44
1,945. So that's, 80 years ago.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:48
You can see my screen, can't you?

[Renu Kumari] 11:17:53
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:17:54
Right, okay. And he came up with the idea of a device called the Memex. Which would store everything that went on books records communications as fast as possible.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:18:11
And it was an automatic personal filing system. Have any of you ever, use filing cards?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:18:22
So I think I'll just show you. This, we don't use them anymore.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:18:29
A

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:18:39
But this is a, convenient, file card system. Can you see a bit of that?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:18:50
And within it individual cards that you write on okay that's called a filing card system And this is called a file.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:19:04
And That is how, library catalogues were organized. And how many of them still are.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:19:16
Organized. So if you go into some libraries you'll find massive cabinets which consist of file cards and that's really influenced Rangap in his faceted.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:19:31
Classification. Now, Bush was later, 1945, and he came up with the idea of something which would record everything you did.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:19:45
That was a, Hi, for, some, time, but then, and he came up with a fanciful machine.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:19:57
So this is a typical example. Of what the machine might look like. You can see it's got various tablets on the top, so that's very, advanced And, it's got, I think these are recording on tape.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:20:18
This is, I think. Computer tape at that stage, magnetic tape. Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:20:30
So, So the idea here is to come up with something that records everything and makes it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:20:41
He and natural to find anything you want. And people been working on this for 50. Or more years.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:20:55
Now. The other thing I want to talk about is recording at source. So what we do, is we use something called Open Notebook science.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:21:08
And I will.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:21:20
This was pioneered by Donco Bradley. And it is the practice of making the entire primary record of a research project.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:21:31
Publicly available online. As it is recorded. So. It was promoted by, Jean Claude Bradley, and actually, he was going to call it open science, but I persuaded him to call it open notebook science.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:21:53
And Here's a picture of John Code. And, this was so important, that, He was honored by President Obama.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:22:09
He died tragically young? And I and others organized a memorial. Symposium in Cambridge to honor his legacy.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:22:23
So. Hey, his idea is that everything you do is available to the whole world as you do it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:22:30
And we have been, taking that idea, and trying to put it into practice. It's difficult mainly because the tools don't exist and because the culture needs changing.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:22:47
People are trained in universities very often to keep everything. To themselves, particularly if they're going to be assessed.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:22:56
And, researchers, have the culture that they, the primary purpose of research is to compete against other researchers.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:23:06
So open notebook science It's taking a long time. Develop. But at least the preprint culture is part of the way the towards it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:23:20
The problem we have in publication at the moment and Ranganison would undoubtedly have had, things to say about this is that you create your primary record let's say in a laboratory notebook where you write it in or type it in and you collect data off a an instrument.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:23:46
And then. You transcribe this to, paper. Often with loss of information both mistakes and omissions and then you published the paper which is a snapshot of that research.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:24:04
Now we know that what we're doing is dynamic. So we are doing this day by day. We're capturing it day by day.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:24:14
And a snapshot does not give the totality. So, current message of static publication do not capture the full dynamic range of what we're doing.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:24:30
So having said that, I now want to move on to the technical details as to how we create, semantic information.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:24:41
We are not doing experiments. We are, creating recordings. Talks. Software and so on and as far as possible we're doing that under the open notebook for philosophy.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:24:57
That is that people have access to it as soon as it is created. Github has that, facility so that as soon as you create.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:25:09
A piece of software. You, Up, load it to a public repository.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:25:16
Usually with only a a delay of about. You know, a day or something of that sort. And that was very much the ethos of the human genome project, which, worked on the basis that all sequences they collected were uploaded to sample repositories by the end of the day.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:25:40
And that's 1 of the great, examples of open the notebook science. It's actually predated the term.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:25:52
It was called the Bermuda protocol. And it's a milestone.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:25:58
And open source. And it's a great pity that we have moved to the situation where people are obsessed with measuring their performance.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:26:11
With metrics and those metrics are controlled by the publishers and the publishers have no interest.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:26:17
In open notebook science or anything open. So. That's something which will need to be built into the system in the future.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:26:31
So when Doing what we can with that, but our main activity of semantic output. Is, the different windows we have on climate.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:26:45
We have, PYGET papers and dock analysis. Which allow us to search the literature recently this has been extended with open Alex.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:26:59
And, we can search. Tens of millions of scholarly articles for climate information

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:27:13
We can normally retrieve the metadata for that, and in some cases we can automatically record the PDF or in cases where it's been published fully open in the

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:27:33
Pubmed Central System, we're able to read the XML as well.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:27:39
That's semi semantic in that the document has semantic structure, but for the body of the work.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:27:48
It doesn't have semantic labeling, on the components.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:27:54
But we are working on, making that more and more semantic labeling paragraphs, so on and that's available in the output of dock analysis, and Aimee.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:28:08
So that's a fully semantic. Structure but not necessarily annotated with a schema which is universal.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:28:23
Then we have, the, FCC reports. And again, that's lower priority than the IPCC material at the moment.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:28:34
But the FCC reports are. A list of several 100 I think several 100.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:28:48
Pdf. Documents. They are not semantic.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:28:56
They have no markup and no annotation, but they are written in a consistent format. So we're able to essentially build a template.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:29:06
Or the IPCC. And turn that into something with. A considerable degree of That's semantic.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:29:17
Macro and micro structure and with some of the terms. Identified and labeled. But the main enhancement of that comes with our ability to search the generated HTML.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:29:37
And to link that into. Our glossary system. So we'll come to the IPCC glossary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:29:46
Now glossary is absolutely essential to and adding, and understanding and markup. The terms that are used are glossary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:30:01
Dictionary. And sometimes. And so on. But, We use the word dictionary, but it is a very loose term.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:30:13
And it allows

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:30:17
Supportive glossary operations. So the IPCC call that. Now, the IPCC glossary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:30:28
Is available in EDF form. I think I have to check that. But it's available in a rather inaccessible, HTML, form.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:30:44
It has. Entries for each term, which are separate downloads. So I'll just have a look and see if we can find IPCC.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:31:09
Right. So this is it. It's got these terms here. And you can click on this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:31:15
So if we were interested in which we saw earlier today. You click on that and it gives the definition and the parent.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:31:26
At 10. But this is in HTML which is not easily downloadable and because it's served by a servant.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:31:43
Which requires some. Intelligence on the research. Receiving and So, IS, G, again, was able to, write, headless browser tool that allows us to download all of this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:03
Automatically. And the results of this are about 700 terms, which, are available in that sort of form.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:15
I'm which have been put into the glossary that Simon, Worthington has transformed into semantic HTML.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:26
So that's glossary. Now that glossary is a universal glossary for all the reports.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:36
But there are also individual glossaries. Chap. No, each working group. So if I go into.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:48
Hi PCC. Kamliji 3.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:32:58
We have an annex. And this glossary here. Is a PDF file. So that you see, it's got to be transformed.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:33:10
Into something more useful and it does not overlap. It's overlaps a lot with that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:33:18
Communal glossary, but it does have terms which are not in the communal gloss. So by downloading all the glossaries or the individual chapters we can.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:33:32
Enhance that central glossary. And we're doing so as well. And then the other thing that some of the.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:33:49
Reports but not all of them do. Is they give abbreviations. Annexes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:33:59
Okay, I'm sorry. Johnloads and I think that's PDF. Acronyms, that's it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:09
So if we look at acronyms. Downloads.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:13
Yeah, we got that. And this is PDF. And these are the acronyms which are particularly relevant to W 3.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:26
So.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:32
50 acronyms a page. And we've got about 7 or 8 pages. So we've got a few 100 acronyms.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:41
And if we collect together all the acronyms. That we've got from the various working groups.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:51
Then. We'll be able to have something which is much larger.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:34:59
But you see this act this one WG 3 doesn't have a marker in it. I'll have a quick look and see whether anything in WG.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:35:12
One.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:35:18
But page not found, I expected that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:35:25
I won't spend time. Going working group. And

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:35:34
Yeah. This is, I find extremely difficult to navigate.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:35:44
Here's physical science.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:02
I don't see anything there about acronyms at all. So each report is different.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:12
But, we can hopefully between us now, collect all that together. So I expect at our glossary consists of Probably about

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:26
I'm going to guess about 1,500 terms, that, there will be probably an additional, 3 or 400.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:36
Acronyms which are not. In those terms. And so we're going to end up with somewhere around about 2,000 and entries in this glossary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:46
And we will automatically look them up in Wikipedia and weiki data wherever possible.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:36:55
So that's a glossary. The glossary is there to inform us, but it's also there to create search terms.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:04
So that, we will probably, go through the process of, adding regular expression search terms.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:12
To many of the terms in the glossary. The good thing is it's a static glossary, so we probably only need to do it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:22
Okay, that's, the glossary. Then. I've talked about the FCC, haven't I?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:33
I just to say that we can use the glossary to search the FCC. And, add, semantic meaning to the term.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:43
So if it contains something like I don't know. In there anywhere then, we can link this to.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:37:56
And then finally we come to the IPCC chapters. The IPCC chapters are primarily made available.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:05
In PDF.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:10
So if we go into let's say WG one. Yeah, and we've got something that says

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:25
We're on the chances.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:34
I think we have to go into reports.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:38
Read the report.

[Nitika Baghel] 11:38:39
Maybe I put.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:43
I think this will do it for us. So yes, so we go into. This, and we go to downloads.

[Nitika Baghel] 11:38:45
Thank you.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:38:52
And these are chapter in PDF. But if you go to the Explore button here this is the HTML and you will see it contains expand and contract.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:39:10
Sections. Now. To get that down, we have to use a headless browser, which our, created and it's possible to download all those reports in full, with the headless browser.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:39:28
Technology. So we work mainly from the. Html and not from the PDF.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:39:42
When we've got the HTML, what we then, need to do is to make it semantic.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:39:50
You will see here that if I go into this section, one dot one. Then it has a subsection.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:00
Oh, this is probably a subsection. This is section one. No, this. What's this number?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:13
I think this is chapter one. Chapter one. Section one.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:21
Subsection one. And sometimes we go down to

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:29
Sub sub sections. I don't know if it does it here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:38
Some of them are more deeply nested than others. And this is. A bot?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:45
This is a figure. So we can get down the figures and the captions to the figures are really important here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:40:53
And one or 2 other things to note. Is that there are some hyperlinks here. So pointing into sections.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:01
And at the end of some of them.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:08
There are links to other.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:16
These are links, sometimes 2 references. Cross chapter box. And here you can see we've actually got a link to another section.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:27
One dot 2 dot.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:34
Not very easy to navigate, is it? So we try and honor all of these sections here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:44
And make it easy to navigate. So we have semantic. Labelling for all of the parts and if I go into on these here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:41:59
It's not a good example going to this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:06
Yeah, this one contains 1. 2 3 4

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:12
Powerographs and a box.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:19
And 5. 6, 7. So the paragraphs will be numbered paragraph one to 7, and the box will be, labeled with its particular identity, fire here, which should be universal across the system.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:37
So, what we're immediately offering is a navigation system. That. As far as I know, nobody else.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:46
Offered and it will should be much easier to use. Than the HTML you've got here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:42:55
We've got some work to do on that because, this is, if we open this up.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:02
In Come back here, open it up. And

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:12
This you will see that this has got. Gatsby display markup. So that doesn't have any semantic meaning.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:24
Gatsby focus wrapper. Has no meaning in terms of climate change. And so on and many of these can probably be ignored.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:37
But when we finally come down to

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:44
Sections here. We've got, titles here which That tells what the various sections are.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:43:54
So we will have a semi-smantic. A set of components from the IPCC chapters and that's probably.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:44:06
That and the glossary are our main. Thrusts at the moment. The pie get paper stuff.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:44:12
Will come. And but, the drawback to that is. And that we have to do more work on the actual content.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:44:22
To So I think I've said most of what I want to say. In all of this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:44:33
We've got 3. Main sections. We've got the introduction about climate change and, Oh, we've got a main body about, and all of the components.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:44:49
What they are and then at the end we've got a technical section on how we analyze this and make these a magnification.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:45:00
Automatic. Simon is talking about all the social aspects of semantic climate. So are there.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:45:09
Comments or questions in particular what have I missed out?

[Renu Kumari] 11:45:19
So basically, you're not just, talked about the.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:45:25
Yep, well done. We're going to, we're going to talk about that. So we talked about what we were going to do but not how we were going to do it.

[Renu Kumari] 11:45:27
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:45:35
Very good thinking indeed. So. Our software, so this is another section, our software, is developed in a modular fashion.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:45:51
And here I'm going to show my pie chum. Display of this. There is a general component called Amy Lib.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:46:02
Yeah. And, is a collection of libraries. Which are generally useful for documents.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:46:15
And analysis classification, cementification. Reuse and republicate. So they apply to any set of documents.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:46:26
In principle. Without going through all of them We have something that deals with the bibliography.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:46:36
Tools that deal with CSV. I've recently added a tool which supports dictionaries so that we can create dictionaries easily and we can used it for annotation.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:46:50
The library for HTML. Library on natural language processing routines. Library on converting PDF.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:01
Which is a key thing since we get so much PDF. Small one on SVG.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:08
So we're possible. We convert the graphics to SVG, which is a semantically structured.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:16
Tool. We got utilities, headless browser driver. Rounding boxes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:27
File utilities at this browser game. Various. Things for the command line, HTML logs and Yeah, fogs.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:37
And we were allowed one for dictionary. And various HTML tools. And then look up for Wikimedia and libraries for XML.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:50
Many of these are convenience libraries, which means that, we have a wrap around some of the more.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:47:59
Difficult parts of Python. So how do I join a list? With, commerce.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:48:09
And then Formal way of doing that is very arcane for people just learning computer science, computer.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:48:20
Systems. And so on. So that's Amy Lib. And then with each.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:48:26
L, we have an extensive set of tests. So These are the tests. We've just started to include and so for example, yes test.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:48:43
Set of dictionary tests. And I go here and press. And so.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:48:55
Yeah. Is a class with all the tests and and I think it's got nearly 60 tests.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:03
So here you see. Look up missing wiki data IDs by term. Debug chapter dictionaries.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:15
This, ambiguate wiki data IDs. Create dictionary from a list of strings you will all be doing that because you're creating a list of terms you're interested in.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:29
Some of them are just, addiction, so, ethnobotanics and So on.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:40
Some of them maybe.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:45
Skipped if there are too many of them but this actually runs quite quickly. Add second list of entries.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:49:55
I don't think we would term. Get wiki data of 1st entry. And sound a whole lot of tests.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:04
So let me run this.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:09
A good thing about running it is If it doesn't work, then.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:16
I have an incentive to do this, but hopefully.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:26
Well, it's still red, which means it's running.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:37
Tests. So that's our test should run. There's no very little download in this. We've got 86 tests.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:47
It's finished in 21 seconds for me. 7 tests failed. And I can have a look and see why those tests failed.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:50:59
They're yellow.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:08
But, file should exist. So. There is a test file in my previous incarnation. Of this called pi for Amy.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:20
I haven't copied it over so that's very clear.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:24
Files that exist.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:33
Right cannot open. I've got a software error there. I've got to mend that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:41
File should exist.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:44
Miles should exist.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:51:53
This is an error which you should recognize non-type object as no attributes get or create.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:02
Something or other. What it means is you created an object which you're going to do something with.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:08
And it turned out that that object didn't get created. And so you had a none object instead.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:15
So. Okay, get used to that. And that's so we got 5 did not exist. I have to mend that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:25
We've got one, Well, we've got none object. I've got to debug that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:29
And then we've got some other I've got to men. So I'm feeling quite optimistic about that when I get some time.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:40
I will mend that and commit it. No, in this that we

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:49
We have down here, GET.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:52:52
And I'm on TMR Dick's at the moment. So I've got several branches.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:01
PMR test is where I was, developing some of the Amy, staff, the dict is something, related to dictionary so you can develop different things at the same time.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:16
And none of this will cause problems for Nitica who's got her own branch. Which is called, nitica test or something of that sort.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:29
And which she can commit up to the, the main. If necessary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:38
At some stage we need to merge this. Merging it's easy if you do it frequently and it's a nightmare.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:47
If you take months, before you do it. So at some stage, I will merge this back.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:53:53
You will then find that, your, tests have errors, and we have to then mendows.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:05
And commit a greater a larger and enhanced main first.st But that's Oh yes, remote.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:18
Nitica test, they are.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:21
So, so. All of that works, very nicely. Or. I.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:29
And then the next thing. I'm going to show you is.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:35
Hey, climate.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:40
Recent projects, in climate. So here is. And time it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:49
And here again, we work it by having tests. There's a whole lot of test data here.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:54:56
So you can see I've got captors in here to read. And in particular one called, content.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:55:04
Which should approximate the final versions of the particular I think so, it's not.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:55:14
Comprehensive but I probably will make it comprehensive so so that those people who got chapters will have a semantic version of their chapter because at the moment there's some problem about headless browsers with some of you.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:55:32
So we will create that. It doesn't. Logically fit in test. I should.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:55:41
It possible to put it somewhere in the system. What I'm likely to do, is to create a dictionary.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:55:50
Direct for somewhere in the system. And we might ask everybody to have a directory under their home directory called dictionary where the dictionaries are put.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:56:07
Or we'll probably call it, . Something of that sort. It's, always difficult because it depends on people.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:56:20
How people use things, but you may need to check out separate repository with all this stuff in.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:56:27
And we will probably call it semantic time. I think we've got a semantic climate dictionary somewhere.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:56:34
So, Amy Climate, will look at the, Tests. So. Let's look at test IPCC.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:56:47
Here is our structure. And here we've got about. 30 tests. And you can see things like remove cats being mark up.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:00
Remove wordpress mark up At 6 WT 3 and index chapters with IDs. So that looks like a pretty important one because.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:12
Let's see what it does. We chapter, search for words and return a list of paragraphs in which they're So.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:26
Hey, we're looking for these phrases. We're reading in WT. 3 chapter 3.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:34
With the HTML with IDs, which is our, more or less final version.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:39
And then we will end up with some paragraphs here. Now, what we probably want to do is to save those.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:52
To file. Although some of these others.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:57:58
This one I think actually creates. Files. Not well documented. I certainly don't want to go through to at the moment, but we'll do that in our next debug system.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:58:10
So you can see how the tests develop here relate to the operations we want to carry out. So well done, Renault 4.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:58:20
Bringing that up. So we have 2 main libraries for Amy the general Amy Lib, which you generally won't do very much with, and the Emmy climate library, where you can develop it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:58:35
Researching the climate literature. I should also mention that we have

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:58:54
I get papers here. So Iish as recently updated PIE get papers. And, so there's a repository here about, get papers.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:08
And. Somewhere or other we should have a

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:29
One for dockanellas.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:38
Yeah, we are.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:42
So this is docanalysis. Dark analysis. Doesn't have any, tests on it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:51
It should do. And that's something which may be some of you can help.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 11:59:59
By writings and tests for. Dock analysis. Very well. Got very good documentation.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:06
But I don't think it's got any tests. And so having tests is valuable because it's a way of making sure that it continues to work.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:20
Even if you do things like upgrade, Python and so forth. So does that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:28
We've also got dictionaries in the system. I will mention Try and find them.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:42
See if they're not.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:47
So I just mentioned this. We got dictionaries here under CEV open we've got things like compounds and genus and plant parts and things like that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:00:59
And there are other ones which we've created. Which will do things like poverty and goodness knows what we've got a lot of Dixon is a pretty the very variable in form and so on.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:01:17
And what we need to do is to come up with a good way of creating those dictionaries, rapidly, automating as much of the process as possible and then using them to search and classify the material.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:01:34
We've got and to understand it when we've read it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:01:38
So, Reno, thank you for that. Have we covered nearly everything?

[Renu Kumari] 12:01:43
Yes, we do.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:01:46
Good. Any questions from? Anyone.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:01:54
They can be as simple as possible, don't worry.

[Renu Kumari] 12:01:56
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:03
You understand all of it or your brain is completely frazzled because we've gone on for too long.

[Renu Kumari] 12:02:06
Okay. Maybe they are tired enough.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:11
And date. Absolutely. Okay, so let's make sure we know save things okay. We are going to we're going to close the recording 1st of all.

[Renu Kumari] 12:02:13
Yes.

[Renu Kumari] 12:02:24
It's not.

[Renu Kumari] 12:02:27
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:27
Is that right?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:30
Oh, stop recording.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:34
Right.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:37
What I'm going to do. I'm always very reluctant to. Visit these things before I posted them.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:02:52
The recording should be converting. At the moment we've still got captions on. So I'm going to save the transcript, right?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:03:02
So we've got to remember. It's still recording the transcript, but, Gotcha.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:03:13
So. We've got to remember that the Saving the transcript is different from saving your recording, even though they both happen under Zoom.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:03:25
I think.

[Nitika Baghel] 12:03:27
Yeah, so if you save the, Be asked if you want to, the folder where the transcript is to you.

[Renu Kumari] 12:03:42
So in a folder, when you stop, save the transcript, then it will show the options.

[Renu Kumari] 12:03:49
It's in the documents. I think they've shaped in the

[Nitika Baghel] 12:03:52
Yeah, that's the

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:03:52
Is, is that, is that the transcript close caption? Yeah.

[Renu Kumari] 12:03:56
No, This is for Zoom. This is for Zoom. Yes, maybe that is the close.

[Nitika Baghel] 12:03:57
Yeah, you can check it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:05
So what it's doing at the moment, I believe. It is actually converting these.

[Renu Kumari] 12:04:08
You can click on.

[Renu Kumari] 12:04:15
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:16
I hope it's converting them. If I click them, they will disappear.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:22
So I'm not going to do. Anything there.

[Nitika Baghel] 12:04:26
Yeah, no, I still have the backup. Thank you.

[Renu Kumari] 12:04:26
Hmm.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:31
Right.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:37
Let me look at my activity. I at this stage I'm always very careful. Zoom.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:44
Dot us. I've got 37% of the CPU. So I think it is converting the recording.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:04:52
From these things called double. The thing is, if it hasn't converted them, then you can double click them.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:05:03
But I'm going to kill all my windows here. Okay, so something going on.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:05:18
It's Zoom. Working on something.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:05:27
I'm not gonna kill any of my Zoom windows.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:05:51
She is something called BTT, which is the video transcript.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:06:55
Still running.

[Renu Kumari] 12:07:37
If you didn't double click to convert, do you have to click on that? Or it's automatically done.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:07:42
So

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:07:45
Yes, if it is not converting them, but now if it is converting them, that's the trouble.

[Renu Kumari] 12:07:53
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:07:53
So it's if I click on it now I may destroy everything.

[Renu Kumari] 12:07:57
Hmm

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:08:03
I'm just cleaning up some of my windows.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:08:14
And we also have to decide where to put these things.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:09:15
It's quite a long session, so it might take some time.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:09:31
Okay, I'm going to copy the closed caption over to.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:09:38
Slack that can't do any harm.

[Renu Kumari] 12:10:01
So, MYTHICA has shared the.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:10:09
Give me 1 min while I sort myself out.

[Renu Kumari] 12:10:21
Let me see. Okay.

[Nitika Baghel] 12:10:21
Yeah.

[Renu Kumari] 12:10:26
Yes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:10:28
I just don't know whether this. Hi, I don't think, I don't think this,

[Renu Kumari] 12:10:34
Because it's already there, so that is why I'm asking. So, Peter, you.

[Nitika Baghel] 12:10:38
It's a screen share. Where it should be screen sharing. Bye.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:10:39
Right.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:10:45
I will stop screen sharing.

[Renu Kumari] 12:10:58
Okay.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:11:03
I should say, you know, we're spending lots of time on these sessions. It will get less after we send this manuscript off, won't it?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:11:45
She what I got from the last one is I got Oh, audio, closed caption, etc, etc.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:11:53
I think.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:02
Oh, Zoom has gone up to, 73. So it's Zoom is doing something.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:10
I hope it isn't in a. Closed loop or whatever.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:16
I mean, it may just be that.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:19
Is due to our activity but I doubt it.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:27
Okay. Let's give it. 5 more minutes.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:34
And then we will end the session.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:38
So any Comments or thoughts before we do that. I'm going to post my, the one transcript I have got.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:12:49
Into

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:13:04
And, resources.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:13:36
So this is my

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:13:45
Those caption right?

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:13:54
You seen the one before I had video VTT.

[Peter Murray-Rust] 12:14:08
So, oh, wait a minute. Maybe this is because I'm still recording the transcripts.

[Renu Kumari] 12:14:19
Because
