China&#8217;s climate leadership has received a degree of international recognition. For instance, Charles Parker&#8217;s research shows that China&#8217;s climate leadership has received increasingly more recognitions from international negotiators and representatives of all delegations from 2009 to 2015 (Parker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017</xref>). The EU&#8217;s Commissioner for climate action&#8212;Miguel Arias Ca&#241;ete&#8212;also emphasized that the shared leadership of the EU and China in GCG is needed more than ever (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>). An EU climate official pointed out that &#8216;China is transiting from a developing country to a leading actor in climate governance&#8217; (Interview 2018). An EU principal climate advisor concluded that &#8216;China is showing leadership by taking on more responsibilities&#8217; (Interview 2018). China&#8217;s embrace of a shared leadership is quite similar to the EU&#8217;s new approach since Paris that the EU acknowledged different pathways towards climate justice and wielded leadership through a more interactive way, i.e. being open to others&#8217; suggestions and negotiating their consent (von Lucke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2021</xref>).</p>
