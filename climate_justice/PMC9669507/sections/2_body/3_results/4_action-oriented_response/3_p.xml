<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our analysis revealed three main types of actions referenced in readers&#8217;
comments: political, economic, and health-related actions.
<italic toggle="yes">Political</italic> actions are best described in terms of comments
requesting actions that are political in nature such as voting the president out
(e.g. &#8220;Call them out on it . . . and vote them out on it.&#8221;) or calling for
collective action (e.g. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the people to organize and demand action&#8221;).
<italic toggle="yes">Economic</italic> actions include comments calling for the
distribution of economic relief packages to support individuals, families, and
businesses impacted by the virus (e.g. &#8220;$1000 a month would go a long way to
helping millions of Americans who will lose their jobs in the coming months from
an economy grinding to a halt.&#8221;). Finally, <italic toggle="yes">health-related</italic>
actions were expressed through comments encouraging the adoption of health
measures on the individual or societal levels, such as social distancing, to
slow down the rising number of COVID-19 cases and protect vulnerable groups in
the medical profession (e.g. &#8220;social distancing will matter greatly to avoid the
peak happening too quickly.. Let&#8217;s do all we can to flatten the curve, to care
for the high risk and our medical professionals.).</p>
