This is &#8216;disaster capitalism&#8217; (Klein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). There is an element of this &#8216;disaster capitalism&#8217; response in the staging of the UN&#8217;s Food Systems Summit (UNFSS). But the Summit has a <italic>global</italic> institutional dimension insofar as the World Economic Forum (WEF) has enlisted the United Nations in a Faustian bargain. Here member states&#8217; collective institutional representative has surrendered the principle and practice of multilateralism<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> to a crudely sophisticated smokescreen called &#8216;stakeholderism.&#8217; This highly selective ruse enables corporate capture. And in a system of multi-stakeholder governance, there are &#8216;no recognized standards governing the internal decision-making process of MSGs or ones that clarify the obligations, responsibilities, and liabilities of these new &#8216;governors&#8217;&#8217; (Gleckman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>: 102).</p>
