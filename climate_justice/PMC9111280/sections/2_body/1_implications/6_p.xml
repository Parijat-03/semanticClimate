<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Though disproportionate racial exposure to urban heat is well&#8208;established in the literature (Hsu et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), our ongoing research in Atlanta, Georgia has established the term &#8220;racialized urban heat island (R&#8208;UHI)&#8221; to describe the phenomenon. In collaboration with scholars at University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University, and North Carolina A and T State University, we have also explored radical new concepts for engineering cities for thermal justice. Liu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) confirm that the waste heat term will need to be central to those efforts going forward.</p>
