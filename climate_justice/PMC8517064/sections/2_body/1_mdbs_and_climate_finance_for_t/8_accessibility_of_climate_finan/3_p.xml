The ASAP program consisted of a separate and dedicated fund to provide grants for adaptation actions that accompanied IFAD project loans. Since ASAP was implemented jointly with IFAD lending activities, there was a rigorous process of ensuring safeguards were in place and fiduciary standards met at the country level as part of the loan process which ASAP then piggy-backed upon. The application for the grant itself was then relatively simple. While this approach reduced transactions costs for accessing climate finance, it also picked up the problems inherent in the development lending process. This includes delays in approvals and disbursements as well as constraints in the beneficiary selection. IFAD lends only to national governments and is thus unable to channel funds to other entities that could be effective actors in the adaptation sector.</p>
