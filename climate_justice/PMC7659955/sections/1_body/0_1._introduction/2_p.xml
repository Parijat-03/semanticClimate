<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To effectively play its role in smart villages, precision agriculture covers smart and climate smart agriculture (CSA) techniques, and other aspects that are capable of ensuring higher agricultural production output in an environment-friendly manner, provides optimum income for the farmer, and is able to feed a growing population. Many studies showed that these processes can be realized through the adoption of ultra-modern agricultural techniques such as bio and nano technologies [<xref rid="B6-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], IoT and blockchain-based methods [<xref rid="B7-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and drone technologies [<xref rid="B8-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], among other climate smart ideas. On the basis of this argument, efforts that tend to reduce farming losses, increase yield, as well as monitor, detect, and potentially prevent plant and animal diseases are now being automated, finding growing applications, and offering optimal solutions. Based on the forgone explanations, the current study attempts to establish smart and CSA trends in smart village research, in order to see how much they are useful for smart village development. </p>
