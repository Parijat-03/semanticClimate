The project evolved in two ways: into community archiving and into a vibrant discussion about ethics and social media and the importance of requesting permission. We felt that journalists and other researchers putting these tweets into their articles, or their dissertations, or their books without permission from the creator was an ethical violation. We also knew that when Washington University started the <italic>Documenting Ferguson</italic> archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digital.wustl/edu/ferguson/">http://digital.wustl/edu/ferguson/</ext-link>), allowing people to upload whatever they wanted related to the racial unrest and the protests, police forces were using the materials for surveillance, and they were taking images from the archive and arresting people a year or two later, which was not how the archive was intended to be used. So, from the Ferguson situation, we realized the importance of ethics. We realized that it was important to protect the creators, anonymous or not, and to protect the activists and others involved, whether or not they wanted to be.</p>
