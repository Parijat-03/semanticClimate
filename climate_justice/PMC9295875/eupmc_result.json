These factors of the pandemic, global warming, and energy-mix are able to be related to each other in the analysis. The simulations are performed by the modeling which has the quantifications of energy-mix study as mitigations, pandemic, and global-warming. Carbon neutrality is connected to global warming via energy-mix and mitigations. In the case of mitigations, energy-mix case oscillated much higher than the non-energy-mix case. In the case of global warming, the relative impact value is higher in the non-energy-mix case. So, global warming is mitigated when the energy-mix is performed. In figure, the 9.875th year has the biggest difference between the two cases when the energy-mix has the highest effect on the global warming aspect. After this pandemic, the leverage of carbon neutrality could be made.", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, The Cyber University of Korea, 106 Bukchon-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03051 Republic of Korea.", "publicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Global warming", "Nuclear", "Pandemic", "Renewable", "Energy-Mix"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02551-9"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9295875"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9295875?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2022-07-25", "firstIndexDate": "2022-07-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-07-25", "dateOfRevision": "2022-07-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-07-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-07-19"}
