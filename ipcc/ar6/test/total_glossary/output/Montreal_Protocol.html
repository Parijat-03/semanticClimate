<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in Montreal in 1987, and subsequently adjusted and amended (including London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997), Beijing (1999) and Kigali(2016)).</p>
<p>It controls the consumption and production of chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals that destroy <em>stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</em>, such as <em>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</em>, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and many others. Since the Kigali Amendment in 2016, <em>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</em>, which were used as alternatives to <em>ozone-depleting substances (ODSs)</em>, have been targeted for a phase-down due to their <em>climate</em> effect as <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em>.</p>
