In 2012, Dominelli initiated the green social work (GSW) framework under the general social work umbrella, which contextualizes social work interventions in the global context of climate change, disasters, and other diverse crises [<xref rid="B2-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. GSW aims to enhance social workers&#8217; holistic understanding of various societal dimensions that jointly shape human behaviors and impact their health and well-being, individually and collectively, in disaster settings [<xref rid="B2-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite gaining recent attention, GSW has been slow to develop in the social work curriculum and professional training in Canadian social work education and practice [<xref rid="B3-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This deficit has jeopardized the integration of environmental justice and sustainability into social work research and practice in the Canadian context and delayed Canadian social work professionals&#8217; collaboration with their international peers from diverse backgrounds in addressing one of the most urgent issues of extreme events that threaten global sustainability [<xref rid="B4-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These impacts eventually weaken the social workers&#8217; advocacy in the domestic and international realms of social justice, human rights, health, and well-being.</p>
