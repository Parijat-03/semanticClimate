The COVID&#8208;19 cases had a small peak during this period. With some businesses (e.g., public parks, green space, and national parks) reopened as early as June, people might have started to loosen the stay&#8208;at&#8208;home restrictions and travel to parks or natural open spaces for outdoor recreation following the social distancing practice. The NPI policies and strategies in different states can also affect the spatial variations of COVID&#8208;19 impacts on human mobility to parks. For example, with the limited access to national parks and continued restrictive NPI strategies in Wyoming and Utah during June and July, our results indicated the negative relationship between the COVID&#8208;19 cases and park visitation (HuschBlackwell,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, with the slowly reopening parks and more loosened NPI strategies in the southwestern states during June to September, our results showed a positive correlation between COVID&#8208;19 cases and park visitation (HuschBlackwell,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>
