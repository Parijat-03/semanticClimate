Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas is a&#160;reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and integrity of rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a&#160;process or combination of processes, including processes arising from human activities and habitation patterns, such as (i) soil erosion caused by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical, biological, or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation&#8217; (UNCCD 1994, Article&#160;1).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.43" top="483.54"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.29; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="483.54" x1="307.43">For this report, the SRCCL de&#64257;nition is intended to complement the more detailed UNCCD de&#64257;nition above, expanding the scope to all regions, not just drylands, providing an operational de&#64257;nition that emphasises the relationship between land degradation and climate. Through its attention to the three aspects&#160;&#8211; biological productivity, ecological integrity and value to humans&#160;&#8211; the SRCCL de&#64257;nition is consistent with the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) concept, which aims to maintain or enhance the land-based natural capital, and the ecosystem services that &#64258;ow from it (Cowie et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.43" top="363.55"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 61.54; y0: 363.55; y1: 373.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="363.55" x1="307.43">In the SRCCL de&#64257;nition of land degradation, changes in land condition resulting solely from natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis) are not considered land degradation, as these are not direct or indirect human-induced processes. Climate variability exacerbated by human-induced climate change can contribute to land degradation.

The interpretation of a&#160;negative trend in land condition is somewhat subjective, especially where there is a&#160;trade-off between ecological integrity and value to humans. The de&#64257;nition also does not consider the magnitude of the negative trend or the possibility that a&#160;negative trend in one criterion may be an acceptable trade-off for a&#160;positive trend in another criterion. For example, reducing timber yields to safeguard biodiversity by leaving on site more wood that can provide habitat, or vice versa, is a&#160;trade-off that needs to be evaluated based on context (i.e.&#160;the broader landscape) and society&#8217;s priorities.

As Warren (2002) explained: land degradation is contextual. Further, a&#160;decline in biomass carbon stock does not always signify degradation, such as when caused by periodic forest harvest.

Especially in biomes characterised by seasonal and interannual variability, the baseline values of the indicators to be assessed should be determined by averaging data over a&#160;number of years prior to the commencement of the assessment period (Orr et al. 2017) (Section 4.2.4). </span></div><div left="317.91" right="566.12" top="507.63"><span style="x0: 317.91; x1: 321.96; y0: 507.63; y1: 517.13; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.91" y0="507.63" x1="566.12">Forest degradation is land degradation in forest remaining forest. In contrast, deforestation refers to the conversion of forest to non-forest that involves a&#160;loss of tree cover and a&#160;change in land use. Internationally accepted de&#64257;nitions of forest (FAO 2015; UNFCCC 2006) include lands where tree cover has been lost temporarily, due to disturbance or harvest, with an expectation of forest regrowth.

In AR5 WGI, soil carbon was discussed comprehensively but not in the context of land degradation, except forest degradation (Ciais et al. 2013) and permafrost degradation (Vaughan et al. 2013). Climate change impacts were discussed comprehensively in AR5 WGII, but land degradation was not prominent. Land-use and land-cover changes were treated comprehensively in terms of effects on the terrestrial carbon stocks and &#64258;ows (Settele et al. 2015) but links to land degradation were, to a&#160;large extent, missing. Land degradation was discussed in relation to human security as one factor which, in combination with extreme weather events, has been proposed to contribute to human migration (Adger et al. 2014), an issue discussed more comprehensively in this chapter (Section&#160;4.7.3). Drivers and processes of degradation by which land-based carbon is released to the atmosphere and/or the long-term reduction in the capacity of the land to remove atmospheric carbon and to store this in biomass and soil carbon, have been discussed in the methodological reports of IPCC (IPCC 2006, 2014a) but less so in the assessment reports.</span></div><div left="317.91" right="566.1" top="111.56"><span style="x0: 317.91; x1: 322.12; y0: 111.56; y1: 121.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.91" y0="111.56" x1="566.1">The Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (SR-LULUCF) (Watson et al. 2000) focused on the role of the biosphere in the global cycles of GHG.
