However, if you took that commute by public transit, you would reduce your emissions by more than 4800 lbs a year (American Public Transportation Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). The bus carries other people too, so if your bus replaced the commutes of twenty people in single occupancy vehicles, then together you would avoid 96,000 lbs (44 t) of CO<sub>2</sub>. That is 58 times more CO<sub>2</sub> avoided than upgrading your own car.</p>
