<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">I had a couple of personal reflections of my own family, my kids, and an environmental incident that happened up here at the end of 2019, where the big fires happened in the edge of national park areas and putting houses under threat. My kids started to freak out that very first afternoon because of their access to social media, and where they got their news from, their information from. And the doses of it, and the continuous and the particular perspective or points of view that were being portrayed and that they had easy access to. And it wasn't until their mum and I&#8230; were able to have a constructive conversation with the kids, where I could provide some different points of view about the physical land that they live on, where that fire was travelling through, what climatic conditions were going to come through, and that the fire actually wasn't going to touch their houses, but actually your friend's house over there, they need not to be there in 2&#8201;days' time; they need to be gone. That house will be under threat. You guys can come and stay here, you know it's easy, it's closer to school, you are away from that fire, your asthma does not get messed up with the smoke and whatnot.</p>
