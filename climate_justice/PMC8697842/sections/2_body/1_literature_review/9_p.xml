(2018) focused on the factors affecting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 23 countries, including Australia, for the period between 1985 and 2011. Adopting the LMDI method, the researchers focused on the impact of six factors on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions &#8212; namely, carbon trade intensity, the trade of fossil fuels effect, fossil fuels intensity, renewable sources productivity, the electricity financial power effect, and the financial development effect. The researchers concluded that the productivity of renewable sources and the financial development effect in renewable electricity production per GDP were the two leading determinants of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In addition, they reported that the fossil fuel energy consumption effect increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the research countries.</p>
