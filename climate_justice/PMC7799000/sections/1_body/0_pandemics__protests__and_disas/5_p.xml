<bold>M<sc>Eredith</sc> E<sc>Vans</sc>:</bold> I am the director of the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, the past president of the Society of American Archivists (<sc>Saa</sc>), and the former director of special collections at Washington University in St. Louis. We're not collecting COVID-19-related items, but we do share property with the Carter Center, which has decided to start doing local programming, so we'll participate in that. It will be more about creating safe spaces and educating people on COVID-19 or voting rights.</p>
