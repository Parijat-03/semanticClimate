For instance, Yu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2021</xref>) provided a decoupling factor analysis and decomposition analysis for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from China&#8217;s residential buildings utilizing Tapio&#8217;s approach for the decoupling factor analysis and the LMDI approach for the decomposition analysis. Yu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2021</xref>) focused on four different factors, including residential building CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, residential carbon intensity, and per capita GDP across 30 provinces of China over the period 2000&#8211;2015. The results of the study confirmed that the decoupling trend between per capita GDP and carbon intensity transformed from weak decoupling to strong decoupling in 30 Chinese provinces during the study period.</p>
