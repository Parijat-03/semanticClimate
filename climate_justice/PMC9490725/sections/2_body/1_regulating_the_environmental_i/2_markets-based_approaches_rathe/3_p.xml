Green and Denniss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>: 75) argue that &#8220;climate policies themselves, by (re-)allocating resources, creating institutions, incentivising investments and influencing culture, also affect patterns of politics and power relations in subtle but crucial ways, in turn shaping what becomes feasible in the future&#8221;. Therefore, strong climate policies can themselves influence politics and increase the acceptability of more stringent policies in the future. These points speak to the issue of policy feedback which is a large topic in its own right beyond the scope of this paper (cf. Jordan &amp; Matt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>).</p>
