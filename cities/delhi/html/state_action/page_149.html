This situation is likely to worsen due to increasing population and economic growth. However the daily transport demand is expected to grow from 139 lakh in 2001 to 279 lakh passenger trips by the year 2021. To cater to this demand, the mass transport system will need to be augmented substantially and the road infrastructure, traffic management and associated amenities improved substantively. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.1" top="621.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="621.27" x1="526.1" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 621.27; y1: 633.27; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are several factors responsible for the prevailing road congestion, pollution and lack of road safety. The basic cause, however, is the imbalance in the modal mix of passenger traffic carried by various modes of transport. There is a preponderance of low capacity vehicles such as two wheelers and cars. This is induced by increasing inadequacy of mass transport to cater to travel demand both in quantity and quality. Some of the key issues in transport sector that Delhi city is facing are: </span></div><div left="72.02" right="81.25" top="526.82"><span x0="72.02" y0="526.82" x1="81.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.75; y0: 526.82; y1: 535.82; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="90.02" y0="526.08" x1="322.36" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 98.69; y0: 526.08; y1: 538.08; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">High growth rate of vehicles and heavy vehicular volumes on road causing congestion, delay and pollution </span></div><div left="72.02" right="81.25" top="473.18"><span x0="72.02" y0="473.18" x1="81.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.75; y0: 473.18; y1: 482.18; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="90.02" y0="472.44" x1="322.33" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 98.69; y0: 472.44; y1: 484.44; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Non- intensive land utilization with respect to major transport corridors </span></div><div left="72.02" right="81.25" top="435.5"><span x0="72.02" y0="435.5" x1="81.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.75; y0: 435.5; y1: 444.5; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="90.02" y0="434.76" x1="322.31" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 96.7; y0: 434.76; y1: 446.76; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Parking mix.

The large influx of vehicles from outside and especially the transit truck traffic cause enormous pollution and negate the effect of local pollution control efforts. The night time pollution is also very high in Delhi because of movement of truck traffic. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="81.25" top="274.68"><span x0="72.02" y0="274.68" x1="81.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.75; y0: 274.68; y1: 283.68; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="90.02" y0="273.94" x1="526.2" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 97.36; y0: 273.94; y1: 285.94; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The travel characteristics and modal share of Delhi is unfortunately not reflected in either the allocation of road space to the different users or the design of the Roads themselves.

Very large block sizes and limited permeability, particularly at the tertiary level, have, in turn, resulted in an overdependence on the City&#8217;s Arterial network for all mobility needs, both local and otherwise. This not only results in limited route options for the commuter but also greater travel time and increased congestion on the roads. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="81.25" top="103.88"><span x0="72.02" y0="103.88" x1="81.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.75; y0: 103.88; y1: 112.88; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="90.02" y0="103.13" x1="526.21" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 97.36; y0: 103.13; y1: 115.13; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The multi-modal public transport system of the city is not integrated.
