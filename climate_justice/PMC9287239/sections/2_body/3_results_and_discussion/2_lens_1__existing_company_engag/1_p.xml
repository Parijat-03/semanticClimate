Of these target-setting companies, those with higher emissions, higher perceived business risk from climate change, experience setting and achieving ambitious targets, and higher reputation for managing climate impacts are more likely to set SBTs. Findings that companies set SBTs to ensure sufficiently ambitious targets, confer legitimacy on climate efforts, and mitigate business risk from climate change suggest both substantive and symbolic motives. There is mixed evidence as to whether SBTs lead to more ambitious targets, but companies with SBTs report higher investments in emission reduction initiatives. There is some evidence that climate-related investments may not be sufficiently leveraged to achieve SBTs. Nonetheless, companies are making good progress towards achieving their scope 1 and 2 SBTs. Achievement of scope 3 SBTs has proven more challenging, likely due to the lack of control companies have over these emissions.</p>
