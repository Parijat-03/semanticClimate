<p>For us, this critical positioning informs the importance of creating a &#8216;Community of
Learners&#8217; in the classroom where we work with students to co-construct safe and
supported learning spaces. We draw on the idea of co-creating &#8216;brave spaces&#8217;
which <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Arao and Clemens (2013)</xref> describe as
&#8216;intentional places for activating curiosity, critical thinking and pursue
&#8220;challenging dialogues&#8221; about power, oppression, privilege and justice&#8217;
(p. 149) within the learning environment. Our approach also seeks to empower students to
challenge injustices such as racism and sexism in their future practices as social workers.
Writing in the context of neoliberal policies and structures in India, <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Yvas (2021)</xref> argues that pedagogies that reignite political analysis are
urgently needed to respond to issues facing communities such as poverty, internal displacement
and migration. Likewise, we seek to demonstrate how critical and intellectual engagement in the
classroom can lead to practical actions for social change (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Forde and Lynch, 2015</xref>). Methodologies such as political story telling underpinned by a
critical pedagogy offer tools for educators (see <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bay,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Marlowe and Chubb, 2021</xref>).</p>
