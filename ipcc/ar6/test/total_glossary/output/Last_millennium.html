<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The interval of the <em>Common Era (CE)</em> between 1001 and 2000 CE.</p>
<p>Encompasses the Little Ice Age, a roughly defined period characterized by multiple expansions of mountain <em>glaciers</em> worldwide, the timing of which differs among regions but generally occurred between 1400 CE and 1900 CE. The last millennium also mostly encompasses the Medieval Warm Period (also called the Medieval Climate Anomaly), a roughly defined period of relatively warm conditions or other <em>climate</em> excursions such as extensive <em>drought</em>, the timing and magnitude of which differ among regions, but generally occurred between 900 and 1400 CE. Transient <em>climate model</em> experiments by the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) for the last millennium extend from 850–1849 CE.</p>
