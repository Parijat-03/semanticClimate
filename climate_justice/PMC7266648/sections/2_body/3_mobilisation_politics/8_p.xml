As Uldam and Vestergaard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>) argue, there is a need to refocus on civic participation beyond movement-based and protest-focused analysis. Image is not action, and considerable over-attention to visible movement action raises questions about the extent to which the transition from expressive politics to agenda building to policy design, implementation and monitoring occurs. This saw considerable interest from post-war social movement &#8220;pracademics&#8221; (academics engaged in instrumental and action research), asking questions about &#8220;realising wins&#8221; and the problem of follow-through post demobilisation (see, for example, the practical work of Moyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>, see in the MAP model for social movements).</p>
