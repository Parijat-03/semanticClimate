Particular challenges arose in relation to maintaining the intensity of the student experience, ensuring the programme continued to provide opportunities for students to accept responsibility and be involved in meaningful work on behalf of clients. Interviewing clients remotely, via telephone or using a platform like Zoom, raised security concerns regarding preserving client confidentiality and security of client files. These issues were addressed by changing the interview arrangements, giving supervisors a more active role in the conduct of interviews and in providing advice to clients. Students were required to take more of an observer role than before. This diminution of student responsibility was addressed through the development of more intensive processes of post-interview discussion between supervisors and students, with students continuing to take responsibility for continuing client work.</p>
