There were 281 wards in Delhi based on census data which the city&#8217;s two municipal governments had grouped into 13 zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-04800-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, 272 wards under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) were classified into 12 zones, and the 9 wards of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) were grouped as the New Delhi zone. The Cantonment (Delhi Cantt) is a separate administrative unit under military jurisdiction and was not utilized for our statistical analysis due to lack of Census data.</p>
