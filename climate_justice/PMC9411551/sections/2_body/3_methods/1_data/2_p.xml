To determine the effect of climate change on this baseline flood, seven scenarios of the percentage increase in precipitation based on peer-reviewed research were used to calculate the spatial extent of flooding: 7% (the lowest precipitation change-attribution level as set by the Clausius&#8211;Clapeyron scaling as noted by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>); 8% (the lower bound of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>); 13% (the lower bound of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>); 19% (the likely lower bound of the small region of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the upper bound of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>); 20% (best estimate by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>); 24% (best estimate of the large region by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>), and 38% (the best estimate of the small region by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and near&#160;the upper bound of the estimate by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>).</p>
