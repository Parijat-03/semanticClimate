One problem with resource-egalitarian theories is that they don&#8217;t have the theoretical resources to even ask whether procreation is special. That is because their dichotomous theoretical framework forces us to categorize each factor affecting a person&#8217;s disadvantage as an ambition (or a preference) or a factor beyond one&#8217;s control. The distribution of resources will be sensitive to the latter, but not to the former. All factors that impose a cost (including nonmonetary costs and opportunity costs) on the relevant person, or on third parties, or on society at large have to be conceptualized as resulting from that person&#8217;s preference and ensuing choice or from a factor beyond her control.</p>
