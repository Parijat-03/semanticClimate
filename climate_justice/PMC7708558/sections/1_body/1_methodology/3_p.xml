As such, the categorization schema is a fuzzy set<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> which assigns discourses membership to a primary category while acknowledging that they relate to more than their assigned category.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> We separate discourses to highlight specific relationships that could prove helpful in further developing relational approaches to sustainability, whilst we recognize that discourses could be differently categorized, allowing new relationships to become visible. What we construct is therefore one potential functional assemblage that may be explored in future sustainability research. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents a tanglegram (Hodder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>), highlighting the identified entanglements of the 26 most prominent discourses outlined in our analysis (&#8220;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Ontology</xref>&#8221;, &#8220;<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Epistemology</xref>&#8221; and &#8220;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Relational Approaches to Ethics</xref>&#8221;).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> The tri-partite categorization offers a functional framework for developing relational approaches to sustainability in concert with each other, drawing upon the diversity of discourses while respecting both their distinctions and intra-relations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>Functional assemblage of twenty-six relational discourses relevant to sustainability with connections to ontology, epistemology, and ethics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13280_2020_1322_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
