<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par34">On the other hand, annual rainfall over the lake from 1958 to 2012 (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) had a mean of 1236.1 mm (Stdev = 200 mm) and a relatively low coefficient of variation (CV) of 16.0%. The CV is actually slightly higher than that reported by others (e.g., Lyons et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>, Sene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). At the individual stations, the rainfall peaks around Nkhata Bay and Nkhotakota area whereas Karonga and Monkey Bay to the extreme north and south respectively had the lowest mean annual rainfall. In addition, the CV indicated that the rainfall pattern varies more inter-annually at the individual stations as compared with the basin-wide mean rainfall. The mean annual rainfall pattern across the catchment also shows a generally decreasing trend during the period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), although no change point was detected by the Mann-Whitney-Pettit test. However, the MK trends were not statistically significant at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05 level, for both the spatial rainfall as well as the individual stations.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Summary of rainfall in Lake Malawi basin during 1958 to 2012</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Station</th><th>Mean (mm)</th><th>Stdv (mm)</th><th>CV (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Karonga</td><td>969.86</td><td>178.56</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>Mangochi</td><td>974.36</td><td>201.64</td><td>0.21</td></tr><tr><td>Monke Bay</td><td>963.40</td><td>180.57</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>Nkhata Bay</td><td>1766.15</td><td>394.97</td><td>0.22</td></tr><tr><td>Nkhotakota</td><td>1601.53</td><td>307.62</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>Salima</td><td>1140.98</td><td>200.48</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>1236.05</td><td>201.55</td><td>0.16</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Temporal pattern of mean annual rainfall in the Lake Malawi basin during 1958 to 2012</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
