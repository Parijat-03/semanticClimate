<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre, CIMMYT, has a strong presence in Bangladesh. In our case study, CIMMYT has partnered with a large NGO, Rangpur Dinajpur Rural Service (RDRS). RDRS is active in hundreds of communities across northern Bangladesh and forms farmer clubs through which it can introduce new agricultural technologies. CIMMYT piloted wheat&#8211;maize innovations through the Kalipara branch of RDRS in 2013 and rolled out the project in 2014/2015 to more farmers. The innovations included improved wheat and maize varieties, inorganic fertiliser and machinery including the power tiller operated seeder (PTOS). The PTOS is attached to a small two-wheeled tractor to simultaneously drill, sow and fertilise crops in lines.</p>
