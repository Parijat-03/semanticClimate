<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par36">In the context of science museums, productive struggle implies that visitors and museum professionals are engaged, think critically, and probably experience some emotional disequilibrium (D&#8217;Mello&#160;et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>; Kapur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016</xref>). This can be problematic and uncomfortable as museum staff negotiate, for example, new exhibitions or other educational initiatives that approach controversial terrains (consider, for example, topics such as sex, race, or mental health). It can be equally disorienting and uncomfortable for visitors. What decisions should be made around content to be included/excluded? What knowledges are being privileged/not privileged, and why? How do institutions deal with issues imposed by sponsors and funders? And what about the public gaze? We argue that moments of productive struggle are necessary and provide opportunities for institutional growth, re-prioritizing of goals, and re-branding.</p>
