In many cases, institutions will need to create new systems for measurement and enable a shift to a more sustainable working culture (e.g. embracing virtual meetings over frequent travel). Yet this evolution should be considered as a core pillar of building a strong, effective global health programme that does not contribute to climate change and poorer global health.</p>
