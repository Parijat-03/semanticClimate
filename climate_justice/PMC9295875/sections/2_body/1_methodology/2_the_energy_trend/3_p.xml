As is seen in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> where the list of electricity-mix in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic era is shown (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>), the energy productions are affected by the pandemic state. So, the logical algorithm such as the system dynamics (SD) could be applied to this study where the feedback is used for the quantifications (Woo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). This tool could give the randomly sampled values are constructed for the designed scenarios where the dynamic and feedback logic is supplied to the analysis.</p>
