<bold>Mary:</bold> We cannot wait for conditions to be perfect before moving ahead with ambitious climate action. Whilst countries like the US, Brazil, Australia and others are impeding globally coordinated action, many people from these countries are demanding something different. Working with subnational authorities and the private sector as they respond to the demands of their constituents and clients can be a way to increase ambition. Changing the financial system to value nature, climate and biodiversity properly can help clear the way for progress. Public bodies must be held accountable for how public money is spent &#8211; it is not acceptable for countries to support the Paris Agreement and continue to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure at home or around the world.</p>
