We found evidence for multiplicative interaction. The adjusted ORs (aORs) for the association of heavy rainfall were greater for prevalent HIV in rural areas (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.20-1.30), in adults aged 30 years or older (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22), and in younger adults (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16). Similarly, the odds for the association of heavy rainfall with STIs were greater in rural areas (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19), in adults aged 30 years or older (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23), or younger adults (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12). Heavy rainfall was associated with a higher number of sexual partners in adults aged 30 years or older (aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.26) and in younger adults (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.14). We did not find evidence for effect modification of heavy rainfall by sex in the association with HIV prevalence, STIs, or number of sexual partners.</p>
