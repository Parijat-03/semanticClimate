(a) Mechanisms and\nfeedbacks involved in enhanced Mediterranean summer warming. (b) Locations of observing stations from different datasets. (c) Distribution of 1960&#8211;2014 summer\ntemperature trends (&#176;C per decade) for observations (black crosses), CMIP5 (blue circles), CMIP6 (red circles), HighResMIP (orange circles), CORDEX EUR-44 (light\nblue circles), CORDEX EUR-11 (green circles), and selected single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs; grey boxplots, MIROC6, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, MPI-ESM\nand d4PDF). (d) Time series of area averaged (25&#176;N&#8211;50&#176;N, 10&#176;W&#8211;40&#176;E) land point summer temperature anomalies (&#176;C, baseline period is 1995&#8211;2014): the boxplot\nshows long term (2081&#8211;2100) temperature changes of different CMIP6 scenarios in respect to the baseline period. (e) Projected Mediterranean summer warming\nin comparison to global annual mean warming of CMIP5 (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) and CMIP6 (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) ensemble\nmeans (lines) and spread (shading). {Figure 10.20, Figure 10.21, Figure Atlas.8}</td>
