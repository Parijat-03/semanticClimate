For example, implementation research, a core approach in HPSR, could help improve and accelerate the development and roll-out of these policies (<xref rid="czaa165-B15" ref-type="bibr">Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It could also help codify, document and share lessons applicable for other countries. This could also help address climate justice (<xref rid="czaa165-B16" ref-type="bibr">Pratt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Linking health justice, social justice and climate justice is an integral part to addressing the climate crisis and is another place where HPSR could help foster deeper understanding of the needed policy changes (<xref rid="czaa165-B18" ref-type="bibr">Rouf and Wainwright, 2020</xref>). In doing so, the HPSR community can play a catalytic role empowering researchers and communities to make informed decisions and influence political action (<xref rid="czaa165-B20" ref-type="bibr">Theobald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
