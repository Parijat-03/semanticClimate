<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0025">For the past forty years, much has been accomplished by the HIV scientific community and activist movement. Unfortunately, as presented above, climate change threatens to undermine the global progress that has been achieved when it comes to curbing the HIV epidemic worldwide. Moreover, climate change, whose impacts are unevenly distributed across populations, can further widen these longstanding inequalities in terms of HIV susceptibility, access to care, clinical outcomes, and quality of life. Hence, in mounting joined-up solutions to both the HIV and climate crisis, it is imperative that a strong equity and justice lens is embraced. The human rights framework, which is embraced by both the HIV and climate movements, also provides a strong foundation for collective action. Considering the HIV-climate nexus while in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, future health systems will need to be not only pandemic-resistant but also responsive to the healthcare needs of people affected by HIV/AIDS while also resilient to the long-term changes brought about by the climate crisis. The framework described above will serve as a guide for the next generation of researchers and practitioners who will tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the face of a warming planet. Ultimately, the HIV/AIDS and climate justice movements must join forces in calling for accelerated worldwide decline in greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors in order to stabilize the global climate - this will benefit not just people affected by HIV/AIDS but everyone.</p>
