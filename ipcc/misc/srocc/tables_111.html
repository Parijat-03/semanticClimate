      <td>Reforestation with mixes of native species, especially in areas that retain fragments of native forest, can support ecosystem services\nand biodiversity recovery, with positive social and environmental co-benefits (Cunningham et al. 2015a; Dendy et al. 2015; Chaudhary\nand Kastner 2016; Huang et al. 2018; Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Section 4.5). Even though species diversity in re-growing forests is typically\nlower than in primary forests, planting native or mixed species can have positive effects on biodiversity (Brockerhoff et al. 2013;\nPawson et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2014). Reforestation has been shown to improve links among existing remnant forest patches,\nincreasing species movement, and fostering gene flow between otherwise isolated populations (Gilbert-Norton et al. 2010; Barlow\net al. 2007; Lindenmayer and Hobbs 2004).</td>

These social benefits could be most successfully achieved if\nlocal communities&#8217; concerns are considered (Le et al. 2012).

      <td>Industrial forest management can be in conflict with the needs of forest-dependent people and community-based forest management\nover access to natural resources (Gerber 2011; Baral et al. 2016) and/or loss of customary rights over land use (Malkam&#228;ki et al. 2018;\nCotula et al. 2014). A common result is out-migration from rural areas and diminishing local uses of ecosystems (Gerber 2011). Policies\npromoting large-scale tree plantations gain traction if these are reappraised in view of potential co-benefits with several ecosystem\nservices and local societies (Bull et al. 2006; Le et al. 2012).</td>

      <td>Sequestration of CO from the atmosphere through forest area expansion has become a fundamental part of stringent climate change\n2\nmitigation scenarios (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Fuss et al. 2018) (e.g., Sections 2.5, 4.5 and 6.2). The estimated mitigation potential ranges\nfrom about 0.5 to 10 GtCO yr&#8211;1 (robust evidence, medium agreement), and depends on assumptions regarding available land and\n2\nforest carbon uptake potential (Houghton 2013; Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Griscom et al. 2017; Lenton 2014; Fuss et al. 2018;\nSmith 2016) (Section 2.5.1). In climate change mitigation scenarios, typically, no differentiation is made between reforestation and\nafforestation despite different overall environmental impacts between these two measures. Likewise, biodiversity conservation,\nimpacts on water balances, other ecosystem services, or land-ownership &#8211; as constraints when simulating forest area expansion\n(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) &#8211; tend not to be included as constraints when simulating forest area expansion.</td>

      <td>Projected forest area increases, relative to today&#8217;s forest area, range from approximately 25% in 2050 and increase to nearly 50% by\n2100 (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Humpenoder et al. 2014). Potential adverse side-effects of such large-scale measures,\nespecially for low-income countries, could be increasing food prices from the increased competition for land (Kreidenweis et al. 2016;\nHasegawa et al. 2015, 2018; Boysen et al. 2017) (Section 5.5). Forests also emit large amounts of biogenic volatile compounds\nthat under some conditions contribute to the formation of atmospherically short-lived climate forcing compounds, which are also\ndetrimental to health (Ashworth et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2013). Recent analyses argued for an upper limit of about 5 million km2\nof land globally available for climate change mitigation through reforestation, mostly in the tropics (Houghton 2013) &#8211; with potential\nregional co-benefits.</td>

      <td>Since forest growth competes for land with bioenergy crops (Harper et al. 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6), global area\nestimates need to be assessed in light of alternative mitigation measures at a given location. In all forest-based mitigation efforts,\nthe sequestration potential will eventually saturate unless the area keeps expanding, or harvested wood is either used for long-term\nstorage products or for carbon capture and storage (Fuss et al. 2018; Houghton et al. 2015) (Section 2.5.1). Considerable uncertainty in\nforest carbon uptake estimates is further introduced by potential forest losses from fire or pest outbreaks (Allen et al. 2010; Anderegg\net al. 2015) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2). And like all land-based mitigation measures, benefits may be diminshed by land-use\ndisplacement, and through trade of land-based products, especially in poor countries that experience forest loss (e.g., Africa) (Bhojvaid\net al. 2016; Jadin et al. 2016).</td>
