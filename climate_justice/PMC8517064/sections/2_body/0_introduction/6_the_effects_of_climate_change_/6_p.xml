Steiner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>) identify key priorities for transforming food systems under a changing climate and they too include improvements in resilience, sustainability and productivity of rural livelihoods including small-scale agriculture in developing countries as a key priority. De-risking food value chains through early warning systems, adaptive safety nets and climate advisory systems is another priority as is realigning policies and financing to build sustainable food systems that enhance equity while also attracting a major expansion in private sector investments (Steiner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>).</p>
