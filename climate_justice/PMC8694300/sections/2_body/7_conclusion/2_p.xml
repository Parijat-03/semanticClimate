While expressing disappointment that the previous goal of US$100 billion per year by 2020 had not been met, representatives at the meeting approved doubling such financial assistance for climate change adaptation by 2025. On a more controversial topic, funding for climate-related &#8220;loss and damage&#8221; currently suffered by low-income countries was acknowledged for the first time (in article VI of the final draft document), calling for &#8220;dialogue among parties, relevant organizations, and stakeholders to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p>
