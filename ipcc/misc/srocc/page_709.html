A large portfolio of measures is available to shape outcomes in these areas from the use of tariffs or subsidies, to payments for production practices (OECD 2018). In the past, efforts to increase food production through signi&#64257;cant investment in agricultural research, including crop improvement, have bene&#64257;ted farmers by increasing yields and reducing losses, and have helped consumers by lowering food prices (Pingali 2012, 2015; Alston and Pardey 2014; Popp et al. 2013). Public spending on agriculture research and development (R&amp;D) has been more effective at raising sustainable agriculture productivity than irrigation or fertiliser subsidies (OECD 2018). Yet, on average, between 2015 and 2017, governments spent only around 14% of total agricultural support on services, including physical and knowledge infrastructure, transport and information and communications technology.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="351.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 351.56; y1: 361.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="351.56" x1="313.24">In terms of increasing food availability and supply, producer support, including policies mandating subsidies or payments, have been used to boost production of certain commodities or protect ES. Incentives can distort markets and farm business decisions in both negative and positive ways. For example, the European Union promotes meat and dairy production through voluntary coupled direct payments. These do not yet internalise external damage to climate, health, and groundwater (Velthof et al. 2014; Bryngelsson et al. 2016). In most countries, producer support has been declining since the mid-1990s (OECD 2018).

However over-exploitation and degradation of rivers has resulted in a decreasing trend in the contribution of capture &#64257;sheries to protein security in comparison to managed aquaculture (Welcomme et al. 2010). Aquaculture, however, competes for land and water resources with many negative ecological and environmental impacts (Verdegem and Bosma 2009; Tidwell and Allan 2001). Inland capture &#64257;sheries are undervalued in national and regional food security, ES and economy, are data de&#64257;cient and are neglected in terms of supportive policies at national levels, and absent in SDGs (Cooke et al. 2016; Hall et al. 2013; Lynch et al. 2016). Revival of sustainable capture &#64257;sheries and converting aquaculture to environmentally less-damaging management regimes, is likely to succeed with the following measures: investment in recognition of their importance, improved valuation and assessment, secure tenure and adoption of social, ecological and technological guidelines, upstream-downstream river basin cooperation, and maintenance of ecological &#64258;ow regimes in rivers (Youn et al. 2014; Mostert et al. 2007; Ziv et al. 2012; Hurlbert and Gupta 2016; Poff et al. 2003; Thomas 1996; FAO 2015a).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="471.63"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 471.63; y1: 481.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="471.63" x1="571.77">Extension services, and policies supporting agricultural extension systems, are also critical. Smallholder farmer-dominated agriculture is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Without education and incentives to manage land and forest resources in a manner that allows regeneration of both the soils and wood stocks, smallholder farmers tend to generate income through inappropriate land management practices, engage in agricultural production on unsuitable land and use fertile soils, timber and &#64257;rewood for brick production and construction. Also, they engage in charcoal production (deforestation) as a coping mechanism (increasing income) against food de&#64257;ciency (Munthali and Murayama 2013). Through extension services, governments can play a proactive role in providing information on climate and market risks, animal and plant health. Farmers with greater access to extension training retain more crop residues for mulch on their &#64257;elds (Jaleta et al. 2015, 2013; Baudron et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="267.66"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.77; y0: 267.66; y1: 277.16; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="267.66" x1="571.74">Food security cannot be achieved by increasing food availability alone. Policy instruments, which increase access to food at the household level, include safety-net programming and universal basic income. The graduation approach, developed and tested over the past decade using randomised control trials in six countries, has lasting positive impacts on income, as well as food and nutrition security (Banerjee et&#160;al. 2015; Raza and Poel 2016) (</span><span style="x0: 510.44; x1: 513.25; y0: 195.67; y1: 205.17; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="510.44" y0="195.67" x1="567.21">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 567.21; x1: 569.49; y0: 195.67; y1: 205.17; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="567.21" y0="195.67" x1="571.77">, </span><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.3; y0: 183.67; y1: 193.17; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.72" y0="183.67" x1="382.67">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 382.67; x1: 385.31; y0: 183.67; y1: 193.17; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="382.67" y0="183.67" x1="571.76">). The graduation approach layers and integrates a&#160;series of interventions designed to help the poorest: consumption support in the form of cash or food assistance, transfer of an income-generating asset (such as a&#160;livestock) and training on how to maintain the asset, assistance with savings and coaching or mentoring over a period of time to reinforce learning and provide support. Due to its success, the graduation approach is now being scaled up, and is now used in more than 38 countries and included by an increasing number of governments in social safety-net programmes (Hashemi and de&#160;Montesquiou 2011).</span></div></body></html>
