<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0090">Each Just Transition program grapples with financing the planning and implementation of efforts&#8212;especially necessary worker and social supports. Although locally driven initiatives are emerging as preferred practices, sufficient revenues typically are not available within the local rural economies most impacted by pending loss of extractive industry. European efforts mainly rely upon establishment of massive, multi-governmental European Union funding initiatives and mechanisms, such as the European Commission&#8217;s Structural Reform Support Service, to channel funding to programs, workers and communities <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In the United States, initiatives contemplate layered governmental funding from federal, state and regional agencies, combined with available non-governmental philanthropic and private industry funding <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Examples include the Just Transition Fund and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Strategic alignment and timing deployment of funding for initiatives, in concert with phases of transition in regions, efficiently maximizes investments, as different funding needs exist throughout transition life cycles.</p>
