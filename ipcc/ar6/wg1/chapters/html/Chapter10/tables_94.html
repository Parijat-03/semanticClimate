There is very high confidence\n(robust evidence and high agreement) for the combination of future urban development and more frequent occurrence of extreme\nclimatic events, such as heatwaves (Hamdi et al., 2016; Bader et al., 2018; He et al., 2021).</td>

      <td>The choice of urban planning scenarios and RCM projections shows a large sensitivity during nighttime, up to 0.6&#176;C (Kusaka et al., 2016).\nThe sensitivity is significantly less than the uncertainties arising from global emissions scenarios or global model projections. However,\nthere is a large difference between RCM simulations with and without urban land use, indicating that this impact is comparable to\nthe uncertainties related to the use of different global model projections (Hamdi et al., 2014; Kusaka et al., 2016; Daniel et al., 2019).\nTherefore, impact assessments and adaptation plans for urban areas require high spatial resolution climate projections along with\nmodels that represent urban processes, ensemble dynamical and statistical downscaling, and local-impact models (Masson et al.,\n2014; Baklanov et al., 2018, 2020; Duch&#234;ne et al., 2020; Schoetter et al., 2020; Le Roy et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021).</td>

      <td>The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside the poles and provides the headwaters for several\nmajor rivers (Sharma et al., 2019). Since the 1960s, the HKH has experienced significant trends in the mean and extremes of temperature\nand precipitation, accompanied by glacier mass loss and retreat, snowmelt and permafrost degradation (Yao et al., 2012a, b; Azam\net al., 2018; Bolch et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019a, b; Chug et al., 2020; Sabin et al., 2020). Observational uncertainty and lack\nof consistent, high-quality datasets hamper reliable assessments of climate change and model evaluation over several mountain\nareas, including the HKH (Section 10.2.2). This box assesses observed and projected climate change in the extended HKH (outline in\nCross-Chapter Box 10.4, Figure 1a), in which we include the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Pamir mountains.</td>

The SROCC assessed that HKH (named High Mountain Asia) surface-air temperature has warmed\nmore rapidly than the global mean over recent decades (high confidence). Annual mean HKH surface air temperature increased\nsignificantly (about 0.1&#176;C per decade) over 1901&#8211;2014 (Ren et al., 2017), although Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, Figure 1d shows an\nobservational range of 0.20&#176;C&#8211;0.25&#176;C per decade over 1961&#8211;2014. There is a rising trend of extreme warm events and fewer extreme\ncold events over 1961&#8211;2015 (Krishnan et al., 2019b; Wester et al., 2019). However, summer cooling over the Karakoram (western\nHKH) was reported for 1960&#8211;2010 (Forsythe et al., 2017). A key relevant process is elevation-dependent warming (EDW; reviewed in</td>
