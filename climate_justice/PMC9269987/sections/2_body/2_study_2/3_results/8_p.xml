<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A mediation analysis in line with <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> was performed to test Hypothesis 4a, i.e., whether the prediction of beneficiary sensitivity for pro-environmental intention would be mediated by guilt-proneness. In step 1 of the mediation model, the regression of pro-environmental intention on beneficiary sensitivity, ignoring the mediator, was significant, &#946; = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 2 showed that the regression of the mediator (guilt) on beneficiary sensitivity was also significant, &#946; = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 3 of the mediation analysis showed that the mediator (guilt), controlling for beneficiary sensitivity, significantly predicted pro-environmental intention, &#946; = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Step 4 of the analysis revealed that controlling for the mediator (guilt), beneficiary sensitivity was not a significant predictor of pro-environmental intention, &#946; = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = 0.708. According to a Sobel test (<italic>z</italic> = 7.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), guilt fully mediated the relationship between beneficiary sensitivity and pro-environmental intention. This mediation is illustrated in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
