It is a significant component\nof desertification processes in drylands. Practices to\nreduce soil salinisation include improvement of water\nmanagement (e.g., water-use efficiency and irrigation/\ndrainage technology in arid/semi-arid areas, surface\nand groundwater management), improvement of soil\nhealth (through increase in soil organic matter content)\nand improved cropland, grazing land and livestock\nmanagement, agroforestry and conservation agriculture.</td>

These techniques may benefit adaptation and food\nsecurity by maintaining existing crop systems and closing\nyield gaps for rainfed crops.

      <td>The use of biochar, a solid product of the pyrolysis\nprocess, as a soil amendment increases the water-holding\ncapacity of soil. It may therefore provide better access\nto water and nutrients for crops and other vegetation\ntypes (so can form part of cropland, grazing land and\nforest management).</td>
      <td>The use of biochar increases carbon stocks in the soil. It\ncan enhance yields in the tropics (but less so in temperate\nregions), thereby benefitting both adaptation and food\nsecurity. Since it can improve soil water-holding capacity\nand nutrient-use efficiency, and can ameliorate heavy metal\npollution and other impacts, it can benefit desertification and\nland degradation. The positive impacts could be tempered by\nadditional pressure on land if large quantities of biomass are\nrequired as feedstock for biochar production.</td>

      <td>The frequency and severity of large wildfires have\nincreased around the globe in recent decades, which has\nimpacted on forest carbon budgets. Fire can cause various\nGHG emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane\n(CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and others such as carbon\nmonoxide (CO), volatile organic carbon, and smoke aerosols.\nFire management can reduce GHG emissions and can reduce\nhaze pollution, which has significant health and economic\nimpacts. Fire management helps to prevent soil erosion and\nland degradation and is used in rangelands to conserve\nbiodiversity and to enhance forage quality.</td>

      <td>Reduced pollution\nincluding\nacidification</td>
      <td>Management of air pollution is connected to climate\nchange by emission sources of air-polluting materials and\ntheir impacts on climate, human health and ecosystems,\nincluding agriculture. Acid deposition is one of the many\nconsequences of air pollution, harming trees and other\nvegetation, as well as being a significant driver of land\ndegradation. Practices that reduce acid deposition include\nprevention of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and\nsulphur dioxide (SO2), which also reduce GHG emissions\nand other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Reductions\nof SLCPs reduce warming in the near term and the overall\nrate of warming, which can be crucial for plants that are\nsensitive to even small increases in temperature.</td>
      <td>There are a few potential adverse side effects of reduction in\nair pollution to carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems,\nbecause some forms of air pollutants can enhance crop\nproductivity by increasing diffuse sunlight, compared to direct\nsunlight. Reactive nitrogen deposition could also enhance\nCO2 uptake in boreal forests and increase soil carbon pools\nto some extent. Air pollutants have different impacts on\nclimate depending primarily on the composition, with\nsome aerosols (and clouds seeded by them) increasing the\nreflection of solar radiation to space leading to net cooling,\nwhile others (e.g., black carbon and tropospheric ozone)\nhaving a net warming effect. Therefore, control of these\ndifferent pollutants will have both positive and negative\nimpacts on climate mitigation.</td>
