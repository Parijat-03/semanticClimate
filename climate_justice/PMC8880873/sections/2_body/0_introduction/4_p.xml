<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Many tribes are located in areas with high wind power potential. According to the analysis conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), tribal lands that represent 5.8% of the land area in the contiguous United States have substantial renewable energy technical potential, including 7.8% for utility-scale wind [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Intertribal Council on Utility Policy assessed that Great Plains tribes could supply energy to 50 million homes based on wind energy alone [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, Bronin [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggests that there is sufficient renewable energy potential on tribal land to meet the electricity needs of the entire United States. Thus, the key variable of interest is the technical wind potential. All wind turbines in the U.S. require Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval. We use FAA&#8217;s Obstruction Analysis/ Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) dataset to access the precise location of all built turbines.</p>
