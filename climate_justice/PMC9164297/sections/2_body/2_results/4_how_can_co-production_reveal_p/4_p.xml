In a study in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, methodologies for engaging stakeholders in planning process in ways that addressed asymmetrical social relations and poverty was developed. Stakeholders were engaged separately and measures to manage problems tied to poverty and uneven power relations were implemented during workshops (Butler et al., 2015).
