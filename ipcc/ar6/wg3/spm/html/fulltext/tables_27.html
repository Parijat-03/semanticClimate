      <td>These updated methods affect the categorisation of some scenarios. On average across scenarios, peak global warming is\nprojected to be lower by up to about 0.05 [&#177;0.1] &#176;C than if the same scenarios were evaluated using the SR1.5 methodology,\nand global warming in 2100 is projected to be lower by about 0.1 [&#177;0.1] &#176;C. {Annex III.II.2.5.1, Annex III Figure II.3}</td>

      <td>Resulting changes to the emission characteristics of scenario categories described in Table SPM.2 interact with changes in\nthe characteristics of the wider range of emission scenarios published since the SR1.5. Proportionally more scenarios assessed\nin AR6 are designed to limit temperature overshoot and more scenarios limit large-scale net negative CO emissions than in\n2\nSR1.5. As a result, AR6 scenarios in the lowest temperature category (C1) generally reach net zero GHG emissions later in the\n21st century than scenarios in the same category assessed in SR1.5, and about half do not reach net zero GHG by 2100. The rate\nof decline of GHG emissions in the near term by 2030 in category C1 scenarios is very similar to the assessed rate in SR1.5, but\nabsolute GHG emissions of category C1 scenarios in AR6 are slightly higher in 2030 than in SR1.5, since the reductions start from\na higher emissions level in 2020.

      <td>The large number of global emissions scenarios assessed, including 1202 scenarios with projected global warming outcomes\nusing climate emulators, come from a wide range of modelling approaches. They include the five illustrative scenarios (Shared\nSocio-economic Pathways; SSPs) assessed by WGI for their climate outcomes but cover a wider and more varied set in terms\nof assumptions and modelled outcomes. For this assessment, Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) were selected from this\nlarger set to illustrate a range of different mitigation strategies that would be consistent with different warming levels. The IMPs\nillustrate pathways that achieve deep and rapid emissions reductions through different combinations of mitigation strategies.\nThe IMPs are not intended to be comprehensive and do not address all possible themes in the underlying report. They differ in\nterms of their focus, for example, placing greater emphasis on renewables (IMP-Ren), deployment of carbon dioxide removal\nthat results in net negative global GHG emissions (IMP-Neg), and efficient resource use as well as shifts in consumption patterns\nglobally, leading to low demand for resources, while ensuring a high level of services and satisfying basic needs (IMP-LD) (Figure\nSPM.5). Other IMPs illustrate the implications of a less rapid introduction of mitigation measures followed by a subsequent\ngradual strengthening (IMP-GS), and how shifting global pathways towards sustainable development, including by reducing\ninequality, can lead to mitigation (IMP-SP). The IMPs reach different climate goals as indicated in Table SPM.2 and Box SPM.1,\nFigure 1. {1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, Figure 3.7, Figure 3.8, Box 3.4, Annex III.II.2.4}</td>
