Nevertheless, an introduction of the smart village concept comes with new opportunities brought about by technology, which is currently touted as the major economic driver of the 21st century. The current study, therefore, tries to adopt the technological ideas of CSA in creating a foundational path for smart village development. To do this, the study carefully analyzes the framework of CSA and proposes that the same be adopted for developing smart villages. It is observed that certain fundamental aspects of technological innovation; productivity, new knowledge, new technology, capacity building, vulnerability reduction, increased profits, etc., are fundamental to the building of smart villages. Nevertheless, these fundamental terms cannot be embedded immediately. Rather, it must follow gradual process that gives priority to the important aspects.</p>
