<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">First, a market liberal approach builds on neoclassical economics and the assumption of individual rational behavior to argue that economic growth and higher incomes are essential for effective planetary stewardship. This way of thinking prompts market liberals to propose and support market-based interventions, often with a limited role for governments, as a key tool for global environmental protection. Their notion of justice is often captured in using aggregate social welfare as a yardstick for policy choices, with hypothetical possibilities of redistribution, which are rarely considered in practice. In this view, achieving justice through market processes relies on theories of trickle-down economics that suggest that prosperity fostered by unfettered market operations will lift all boats eventually, including the lot of the global poor. Critics have pointed out that these theoretical assumptions do not lead to assumed results in practice. For example, income growth over the last few decades in the United States has <italic>lowered</italic> the wellbeing of large parts of the population while supporting growing profligate consumption among the wealthiest citizens (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Greenwood and Holt, 2010</xref>). At a planetary scale, it is highly doubtful whether market liberalism will eventually help the lot of the global poor.</p>
