The conceptual framework of IPPA is an ideal-type approach which is difficult to fulfil in real-world science practice. The continuous need to compromise leaves room for inadequate results and thus for frustration. Challenges that arise during process implementation include: first, harmonizing timelines and time periods between those responsible in the process across the four process stages. Second, the definition and consideration of comparable policy measurement details within the impact studies are very challenging. These efforts are important in order to ensure all single studies have more-or-less the same research subject and yield comparable results. Finally, a discussion on how the core and ancillary policies relate directly and indirectly to specific impacts and what policy revisions are needed to increase effectiveness, efficiency and acceptance is essential.</p>
