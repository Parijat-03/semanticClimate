Guided by an ideology that encourages objectivity, many scientists, scholars, and educators are reluctant about getting involved in advocacy (Gamson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Milkoreit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). However, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, &#8220;freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed&#8221; (&#8220;Letter from Birmingham Jail&#8221; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1963</xref>). The environmental crisis is a problem of unequal distribution of resources due to the unequal distribution of power. Yet instead of challenging that power, we opt for non-confrontational approaches like changing diets and modes of transportation. And since environmental organizations are increasingly funded by private interests, challenging those interests can create considerable risk professionally.</p>
