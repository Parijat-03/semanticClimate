During the pandemic, the people&#8217;s health is affected not only by the virus itself but also by the measures for controlling the virus. Therefore, a pandemic response must look beyond the virus and carefully look at the social and economic dimensions of illness. It is required to address both the clinical care of symptoms and the societal roots of illness (Mendenhall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>).</p>
