Are these the right categories for our analysis? Underlying resources as the metric of distributive justice is the theoretical basis of two notions&#8212; preferences on the one hand, and factors beyond one&#8217;s control on the other. Yet there are two problems with this conceptual apparatus when we want to examine the Moral Equivalence Thesis. First, the notion of preferences is theoretically much less sophisticated than other notions such as capabilities or the distinction between different types of needs and wants. As is well known, the notion of preferences (which underlies resource egalitarianism) does not allow a distinction to be made between desires that are morally urgent and those that are not; as a consequence, it erases relevant moral distinctions when thinking about individual and social choices.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18">18</xref> Second, forcing all causal factors of the resulting outcomes into the choice-endowment dichotomy can&#8217;t be quite right.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> There are a number of factors that don&#8217;t fit this dichotomy, such as religious or ethnic affiliation, gender, or indeed parenthood. Those factors demand an analysis that the dichotomous distinctions between ambition and endowment and between option luck and brute luck don&#8217;t allow for.</p>
