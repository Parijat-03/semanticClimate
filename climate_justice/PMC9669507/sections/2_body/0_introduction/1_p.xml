<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Predictive journalism is an emerging genre within data journalism that incorporates
predictive information such as estimations, forecasts, or nowcasts into news
production processes (e.g. reporting, publication, distribution) by using or relying
on data-driven computational techniques such as predictive analytics or computer
simulations (<xref rid="bibr10-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Diakopoulos,
2022</xref>). One potential application of predictive journalism is to assist
the public in reasoning under uncertainty about possible future events and outcomes.
For example, in 2008, FiveThirtyEight began to popularize this genre of journalism
in election predictions to answer the question of who is leading the elections and
who is likely to win. The accessibility of big data paired with advancements in
computational power has also enabled journalists to cover stories beyond election
forecasts and political polling (<xref rid="bibr42-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Toff, 2019</xref>) such as weather forecasts as
well as entertainment (<xref rid="bibr13-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Franck
and Wilson, 2020</xref>) and sports predictions (<xref rid="bibr29-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Pentzold and Fechner, 2020</xref>) and more
recently projecting the number of COVID-19 cases in the future.</p>
