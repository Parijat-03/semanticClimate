For example, in the Western USA, mountain ecosystems are experiencing an increase in the number and extent of wild&#64257;res, which have been attributed to many factors, including climate factors such as earlier snowmelt and vapour-pressure de&#64257;cit (Settele et al., 2014; Westerling, 2016; Kitzberger et al., 2017; Littell, 2018; Littell et al., 2018). Similarly, landslides and &#64258;oods in many areas have been attributed to cryospheric changes (Section&#160;2.3.2). Disturbances can feedback and diminish many of the ecosystem services such as provisioning, regulating and cultural services (Millar and Stephenson, 2015; McDowell and Koppes, 2017; Mcdowell et al., 2018; Murphy et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 2019). Consistent with AR5 &#64257;ndings (Settele et al., 2014) the capacity of many freshwater and terrestrial mountain species to adapt naturally to climate change is projected to be exceeded for high warming levels, leading to species migration across mountain ranges or loss with consequences for many ecosystem services (Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016; Pecl et al., 2017; Rumpf et al., 2019) (</span><span style="x0: 245.86; x1: 248.67; y0: 495.56; y1: 505.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="245.86" y0="495.56" x1="303.35">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 303.35; x1: 305.63; y0: 495.56; y1: 505.06; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="303.35" y0="495.56" x1="307.55">, </span><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.39; y0: 483.56; y1: 493.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="59.53" y0="483.56" x1="131.59">medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 131.59; x1: 133.87; y0: 483.56; y1: 493.06; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="131.59" y0="483.56" x1="151.92">, i.e.,&#160;</span><span style="x0: 153.82; x1: 158.39; y0: 483.56; y1: 493.06; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="153.82" y0="483.56" x1="212.72">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 212.72; x1: 215.36; y0: 483.56; y1: 493.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="212.72" y0="483.56" x1="307.57">). Although the adaptive potential of aquatic biota to projected changes in glacial runoff is not fully understood (Lencioni et al., 2015), dispersion and phenotypic plasticity together with additional microrefugia formation due to cryospheric changes, is expected to help threatened species to better adapt, perhaps even in the long term (Shama and Robinson, 2009). Likewise, traits shaped by climate and with high genetically-based standing variation may be used to spatially identify, map and manage global &#8216;hotspots&#8217; for evolutionary rescue from climate change (Jones et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018). Nature conservation increases the potential for mitigating adverse effects on many of these ecosystem services, including those that are essential for the support of the livelihoods and the culture of mountain peoples, including economical aspects such as recreation and tourism (e.g.,&#160;Palomo, 2017; Elsen et al., 2018; Wester et al., 2019) (</span><span style="x0: 178.07; x1: 184.93; y0: 315.58; y1: 325.08; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="178.07" y0="315.58" x1="248.42">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 248.42; x1: 251.07; y0: 315.58; y1: 325.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="248.42" y0="315.58" x1="255.27">). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="206.49" top="279.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 279.42; y1: 289.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLHNB+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="279.42" x1="206.49">2.3.4 Infrastructure and Mining</span></div><div left="59.53" right="91.19" top="255.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="255.52" x1="91.19">There is </span><span style="x0: 92.98; x1: 97.56; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="92.98" y0="255.52" x1="154.04">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 155.83; x1: 158.64; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="155.83" y0="255.52" x1="307.54">that permafrost thaw has had negative impacts on the integrity of infrastructure in high mountain areas. Like in polar regions (Section&#160;3.4.3.3.4), the local effects of infrastructure together with climate change degraded permafrost beneath and around structures (Dall&#8217;Amico et al., 2011; Dor&#233; et al., 2016) Infrastructure on permafrost in the European Alps, mostly found near mountain summits but not in major valleys, has been destabilised by permafrost thaw, including mountain stations in France and Austria (Ravanel et al., 2013; Keuschnig et al., 2015; Duvillard et al., 2019) as well as avalanche defence structures (Phillips and Margreth, 2008) and a ski lift (Phillips et al., 2007) in Switzerland.

Accelerated glacier shrinkage and retreat have been reported to facilitate mining activities in Chile, Argentina and Peru (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Az&#243;car, 2010; Anacona et al., 2018), and Kyrgyzstan (Kronenberg, 2013; Petrakov et al., 2016), which also interact with and have consequences for other social, cultural, economic, political and legal measures, where climate change impacts also play a role (Brenning and Az&#243;car, 2010; Evans et al., 2016; Khadim, 2016; Anacona et al., 2018). However, negative impacts due to cryosphere changes may also occur. One study projects that reductions in glacier melt water and snowmelt in the watershed in the Chilean Andes will lead to a reduction of water supply to a copper mine by 2075&#8211;2100 of 28% under scenario A2 and of 6% under B2; construction of infrastructure to draw water from other sources will cost between 16&#8211;137&#160;million USD (Correa-Ibanez et al., 2018).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="471.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 471.59; y1: 481.09; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="471.59" x1="566.08">Conversely, there is also evidence suggesting that some of these mining activities affect glaciers locally, and the mountain environment around them, further altering glacier dynamics, glacier structure and permafrost degradation. This is due mainly to excavation, extraction, and use of explosives (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Az&#243;car, 2010; Kronenberg, 2013), and deposition of dust and other mine waste material close to or top of glaciers during extraction and transportation (Brenning, 2008; Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al., 2015b; Jamieson et al., 2015). These activities have reportedly generated slope instabilities (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Az&#243;car, 2010; Torgoev and Omorov, 2014), glacier mass loss due to enhanced surface melt from dust and debris deposition (Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al., 2015b; Petrakov et al., 2016), and even glacier advance by several kilometres (Jamieson et al., 2015), although their impact is considered less than that reported for changes in glaciers due to climatic change (</span><span style="x0: 320.65; x1: 322.75; y0: 291.61; y1: 301.11; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="320.65" y0="291.61" x1="454.38">limited evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 454.33; x1: 456.97; y0: 291.61; y1: 301.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="454.33" y0="291.61" x1="566.1">). Glacier Protection Laws and similar measures have been introduced in countries such as Chile and Argentina to address these impacts (Khadim, 2016; Anacona et al., 2018; Navarro et al., 2018). In addition, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a declaration in 2018 to &#8220;protect and restore water-related ecosystems&#8221; in mountain areas as elsewhere from contamination by mining (UNHRC, 2018); however, evidence on the effectiveness of these measures remains inconclusive.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="455.91" top="171.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 171.42; y1: 181.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLHNB+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="171.42" x1="455.91">2.3.5 Tourism and Recreation</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="147.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 147.52; y1: 157.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="147.52" x1="566.12">The mountain cryosphere provides important aesthetic, cultural, and recreational services to society (Xiao et al., 2015).
