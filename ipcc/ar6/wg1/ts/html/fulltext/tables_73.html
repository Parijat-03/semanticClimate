      <td>Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to deliberate, large-scale climate intervention options that are studied as potential\nsupplements to deep mitigation, for example, in scenarios that overshoot climate stabilization goals. SRM options aim to offset some\nof the warming effects of GHG emissions by modification of Earth&#8217;s shortwave radiation budget. Following SR1.5, the SRM assessed\nin this Report also includes some options, such as cirrus cloud thinning, that alter the longwave radiation budget.</td>

      <td>SRM contrasts with climate change mitigation activities, such as emissions reductions and CDR, as it introduces a &#8216;mask&#8217; to the\nclimate change problem by altering Earth&#8217;s radiation budget, rather than attempting to address the root cause of the problem, which\nis the increase in GHGs in the atmosphere. By masking only the climate effects of GHG emissions, SRM does not address other issues\nrelated to atmospheric CO increase, such as ocean acidification. This Report assesses physical understanding of the Earth system\n2\nresponse to proposed SRM, and the assessment is based primarily on idealized climate model simulations. There are other important\nconsiderations, such as risk to human and natural systems, perceptions, ethics, cost, governance, and trans-boundary issues and their\nrelationship to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals &#8211; issues that the WGII (Chapter 16) and WGIII (Chapter 14) Reports\naddress. {4.6.3}</td>

      <td>SRM options include those that increase surface albedo, brighten marine clouds by increasing the amount of cloud condensation\nnuclei, or reduce the optical depth of cirrus clouds by seeding them with ice nucleating particles. However, the most commonly studied\napproaches attempt to mimic the cooling effects of major volcanic eruptions by injecting reflective aerosols (e.g., sulphate aerosols)\nor their precursors (e.g., sulphur dioxide) into the stratosphere. {4.6.3, 5.6.3, 6.4.6}</td>

      <td>SRM could offset some effects of greenhouse gas-induced warming on global and regional climate, but there would be substantial\nresidual and overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal time scales (high confidence). Since AR5, more\nmodelling work has been conducted with more sophisticated treatment of aerosol-based SRM approaches, but the uncertainties in\ncloud&#8211;aerosol&#8211;radiation interactions are still large (high confidence). Modelling studies suggest that it is possible to stabilize multiple\nlarge-scale temperature indicators simultaneously by tailoring the deployment strategy of SRM options (medium confidence) but with\nlarge residual or overcompensating regional and seasonal climate changes. {4.6.3}</td>

      <td>SRM approaches targeting shortwave radiation are likely to reduce global mean precipitation, relative to future CO emissions\n2\nscenarios, if all global mean warming is offset. In contrast, cirrus cloud thinning, targeting longwave radiation, is expected to cause\nan increase in global mean precipitation (medium confidence). If shortwave approaches are used to offset global mean warming,\nthe magnitude of reduction in regional precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P&#8211;E) (Box TS.5), which is more relevant to freshwater\navailability, is smaller than precipitation decrease because of simultaneous reductions in both precipitation and evapotranspiration\n(medium confidence). {4.6.3, 8.2.1, 8.6.3}.</td>

      <td>If SRM is used to cool the planet, it would cause a reduction in plant and soil respiration and slow the reduction of ocean carbon\nuptake due to warming (medium confidence). The result would be an enhancement of the global land and ocean CO sinks (medium\n2\nconfidence) and a slight reduction in atmospheric CO concentration relative to unmitigated climate change. However, SRM would\n2\nnot stop CO from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions\n2\n(high confidence). {5.6.3}</td>

      <td>The effect of stratospheric aerosol injection on global temperature and precipitation is projected by models to be detectable after one\nto two decades, which is similar to the time scale for the emergence of the benefits of emissions reductions. A sudden and sustained\ntermination of SRM in a high GHG emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change and a reversal of the SRM effects on the\ncarbon sinks (high confidence). It is also likely that a termination of strong SRM would drive abrupt changes in the water cycle globally\nand regionally, especially in the tropical regions by shifting the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and Hadley cells. At the regional scale,\nnon-linear responses cannot be excluded, due to changes in evapotranspiration. However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with\nemissions reductions and CDR would avoid larger rates of changes (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.3, 8.6.3}.</td>
