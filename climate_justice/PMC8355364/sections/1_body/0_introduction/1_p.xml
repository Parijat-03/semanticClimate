This is especially true in light of the assumption that climate change, as a collective problem, also requires collective agency (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Bamberg, 2014</xref>). Student climate justice initiatives fit the psychological concept of collective action. <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. (1990)</xref> define as collective action those actions in which people, as representative group members, advocate to improve the overall situation of their own group (see also <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Iyer and Leach, 2009</xref>). Collective action can also be performed by the privileged in solidarity with the disadvantaged (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
