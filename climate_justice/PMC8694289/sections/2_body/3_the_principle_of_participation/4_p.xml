The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law notes that the trend, which started prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, is global and includes measures that impede the formation of civil society organizations, their ability to seek and secure resources, and the freedom to assemble peacefully.<sup><xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> In 2020, writing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted that &#8220;freedom of opinion and expression goes hand-in-glove with public health.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Also in 2020, Buyse noted how the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions have led to greater use of online media for social organizing and dissent.<sup><xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Maya Gros and Norman Eisen have also since noted how civil society has migrated online in response to limitations on physical civic space in the name of public health, such as quarantines and the prohibitions of in-person gatherings.<sup><xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p>
