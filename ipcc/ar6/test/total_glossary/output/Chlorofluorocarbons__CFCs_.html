<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">An organic compound that contains chlorine, carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine and is used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, plastic foam, insulation, solvents, or aerosol propellants.</p>
<p>Because they are not destroyed in the lower atmosphere, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they lead to ozone (O3) depletion. They are some of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) covered under the 1987 Montreal Protocol as a result of which manufacturing of these gases has been phased out, and they are being replaced by other compounds, including <em>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</em>.</p>
