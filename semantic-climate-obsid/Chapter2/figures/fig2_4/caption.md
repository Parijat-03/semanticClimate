![[fig2_4.png]]Figure 2.4 Contribution of different GHGs to global warming over the period 1750 to 2018

Top row: contributions estimated with the FaIR reduced-complexity climate model. Major GHGs and aggregates of minor gases as a timeseries in a) and as a total warming bar chart with 90% confidence interval added in b). 

Bottom row: contribution from short-lived climate forcers as a time series in c) and as a total warming bar chart with 90% confidence interval added in d). The dotted line in c) gives the net emperature change from short-lived climate forcers other than CH4. F-Kyoto/Paris includes the gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, while F-other includes the gases covered by the Montreal Protocol but excluding the HFCs.
