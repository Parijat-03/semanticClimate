That will be the challenge taken up in this paper. Two critiques of the Moral Equivalence Thesis will be offered: a capabilitarian argument and an argument from human self-understanding. The former will show that the Moral Equivalence Thesis relies on an endorsement of resources as the metric of distribution justice, while the latter will lead to a rejection of the Moral Equivalence Thesis by showing that there is a morally significant difference between procreation and consumption that is relevant when we are deciding how to share scarce resources. But before we turn to those critiques, we must first analyze in more detail the arguments of defenders of the Moral Equivalence Thesis.</p>
