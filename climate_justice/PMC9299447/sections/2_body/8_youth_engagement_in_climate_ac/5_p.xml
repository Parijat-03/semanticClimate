<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In WA, youth climate justice activism occurs in a context of high economic and social dependence upon the resources industry (both metals and fossil fuels), which is mirrored (and secured) by the sponsorship of cultural events. From the &#8216;Woodside Nippers&#8217; to the &#8216;Chevron City to Surf&#8217;, the centrality and visibility of mining within WA influences young people and their engagement in climate activism. Furthermore, undertaking this leadership role may negatively affect children and young people's mental health and familial relationships if not properly supported. A practical framework is needed for youth mental health in the climate crisis, including self&#8208;care and preventing burnout for youth activists.</p>
