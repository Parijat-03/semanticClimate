Coordination of financing from private, public, climate change and overseas development assistance sources is crucial to achieving additionality of climate finance as mandated by the Paris Agreement, and also as a key strategy for expanding the available pool of financial resources. Coordination of strategies and investments for rural transformation and transformative adaptation is essential to achieving effective adaptation in the context of improving agri-food livelihoods and enhancing the direction of financing to appropriate investments. Likewise, coordination of national adaptation policies with national economic and social development strategies and policies and with global climate change policy objectives laid out in the Paris Agreement is important in developing harmonized investment strategies, reducing transactions costs and increasing accessibility of finance to those who most need it. Coordination of rural communities in the planning and execution of adaptation investments in the context of food system transformation has emerged as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of adaptation actions.</p>
