We used regression models to elaborate on the benchmark set by the comparison of means test. These models are able to reveal clues about the direct associations between certain demographics and heat (see <xref rid="ijerph-18-00941-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-00941">Appendix A</xref>). Across our sample of Southwestern U.S. metropolitan areas, we found that a 10% decrease in income is associated with a 0.22 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature during daytime for both extreme heat and average heat days. At night, temperatures were 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit warmer for every 10% decrease in neighborhood income. Regression models controlling for spatial dependency yielded similar findings. We found negative associations between temperature and income across all three temperature scenarios, meaning that higher neighborhood income results in cooler temperatures.</p>
