An emerging body of literature documents the harms and conflicts over extraction of resources needed for decarbonization of our economies and for growth of green and bio-economies (Huff and Orengo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Temper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2020</xref>; Zografos and Robins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2020</xref>), which in some cases have led to murder of those resisting extraction (Butt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Le Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>; Menton and Le Billon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>).</p>
