<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0380">Many of the ingredients for the transformation toward sustainable food systems already exist and have been well-recognized before the pandemic (e.g., <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">Willett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>). The SDGs already contain key elements for more sustainable food systems. These include delivering universal food and nutritional security, promoting innovation and the expansion of sustainable practices, supporting decent jobs, equity, and creating livelihood security, reducing food loss and waste, while protecting the climate, marine and terrestrial systems (see <xref rid="bb0570" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015a</xref>). However, while it is understood that the transformation must be multisectoral in focus and embedded in a wider push toward building greener and more circular economies, the pandemic has also illustrated that the social, economic, and environmental pillars of sustainable development need to be more firmly anchored in resilience. As the reviews and consultative discussions within the IIASA&#8211;ISC Consultative Platform underlined, this foundation currently has its weaknesses, and support for each of the pillars needs to be strengthened.</p>
