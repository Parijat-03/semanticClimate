<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par20">In the PA, SD is understood holistically. Pointing out environmental norms at its very core, the PA emphasizes the &#8220;importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems&#8221; in the sense of safeguarding &#8220;Mother Earth&#8221; and of achieving &#8220;climate justice&#8221; (PA, preamble). An intricate connection of ethical and techno-scientific norms occurs when referring to the notions of &#8220;ecosystems&#8221;, &#8220;Mother Earth&#8221;, and &#8220;justice&#8221;. With regard to the techno-scientific side of the PA&#8217;s macro-level norms, the focus on numerical restriction of global average temperature rise in Article 2 is even more instructive for understanding the normative architecture. It is evident that it links ethical norms of &#8220;justice&#8221; and preservation of &#8220;ecosystems&#8221; with quantifiable information, highlighted through the norm of transparent techno-scientific measurement and the &#8220;global stocktake&#8221; (PA, 14). The PA presents the correlated scientific process as a means for more equity among the signing parties&#8212;as &#8220;a facilitative, non-intrusive, non-punitive manner, respectful of national sovereignty, and avoid placing undue burden on Parties&#8221; (PA, 13).</p>
