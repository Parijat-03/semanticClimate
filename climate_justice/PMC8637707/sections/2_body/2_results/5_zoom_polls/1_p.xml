<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">An average of 123.3 (range: 114-137) participants responded to the polls during
weeks 4 through 8. Over 90% of participants reported that they strongly agreed
or agreed that the sessions increased their understanding of or confidence in
each session's topic (see <xref rid="fig2-23821205211061019" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The session on water- and vector-borne diseases and
climate change had the highest number of participants reporting that they
strongly agreed that the session increased their understanding. Participants
were more likely to report that they agreed (rather than strongly agreed) that
their confidence increased in all of the Zoom poll sessions. Only in the first 2
weeks of the polls did some of the participants (less than 10) respond that they
strongly disagreed. Beginning in week 6, the course facilitator explained the
answer key format before the zoom poll began and there were no longer any
&#8220;Strongly Disagree&#8221; responses.</p>
