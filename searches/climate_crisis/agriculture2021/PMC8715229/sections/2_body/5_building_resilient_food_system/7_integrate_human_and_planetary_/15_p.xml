(2020)</xref> estimate that protecting the 30% of the planet most important for biodiversity could cost between US$103 billion per year to US$178 billion depending on the implementation scenario chosen. This is a fraction of the more than US$ 12 trillion that has been pledged for COVID-19 relief. Crucially, the direct economic benefit of protecting 30% of land and the oceans are US$64 &#8211; US$454 billion, generally outweighing the costs (<xref rid="bb0625" ref-type="bibr">Waldron et al., 2020</xref>). Increased ambition needs to be matched by appropriate implementation mechanisms, including strengthened regulations, monitoring and enforcement capacities. It is not enough just to set targets: guarantees are also needed that these ambitions will be translated into action. The pandemic has highlighted efforts to push back against environmental regulation and enforcement capacities. During the recovery process, there should be a focus on improving access to real-time data on the state of the environment, helping to strengthen public awareness, engagement of civil society, and allowing for independent verification of national policies and actions. Bi-and multilateral cooperation should provide support for strengthening environmental monitoring and enforcement capacities as part of broader programmatic engagement in agriculture and other land use activities.</p>
