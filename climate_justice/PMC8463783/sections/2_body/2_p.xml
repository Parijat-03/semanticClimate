<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The recent Working Group 1 report of the sixth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed this major nature contribution to climate stability, estimating the cumulative carbon sequestration by land and oceans to be 56% of all human-caused emissions between 1850 and 2019 (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). All major global climate models whose simulations give us hope of meeting the target of the Paris Climate Agreement&#8212;to keep warming well below 2 &#176;C&#8212;take the continued provision of this gigantic biosphere endowment for granted, merely concluding, as in the recent IPCC report, that the efficiency of nature's carbon sink may reduce slightly for high emission pathways. This means that the ability of intact nature to continue to sequester carbon is already factored into the climate models and thus in the estimate of the remaining carbon budget to hold to the Paris climate target. Yet this fundamental assumption relies on terrestrial and marine ecosystems remaining sufficiently intact and resilient to human pressures, even as climate change progresses (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is therefore concerning that the IPCC now concludes that Earth&#8217;s temperature is slightly more sensitive to rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations than previously thought (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)&#8212;meaning our remaining carbon budget to achieve the Paris target may have effectively shrunk. If we were able to more accurately simulate feedbacks in the global carbon cycle, such as tipping points in forest ecosystems (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and abrupt permafrost thaw (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the estimated remaining budget could disappear altogether. Hence, safeguarding the biosphere from further degradation or collapse is an existential challenge for humanity.</p>
