The articles approach the UNSDGs to varying extent, mostly with the ambition to see how practices and pedagogies in ECEC can be understood in the light of <italic>Agenda 2030</italic>. In general, the UNSDG framework proves to be a good way to get acquainted with the complexity of sustainability and to work on a shared vision, but it does not suffice to work on daily attitudes or embodied pedagogical practices, as Willockx and Doom argue in their article. The OMEP ESD Rating Scale proves to be an asset when it comes to the implementation of the UNSDGs in different contexts, which is shown in the three articles by Ferm&#237;n Gonz&#225;lez and Chenique-Arginzones, Pribi&#353;ev Beleslin and Travar, and Vi&#353;nji&#263;-Jevti&#263;, Lepi&#269;nik Vodopivec, Pribi&#353;ev Beleslin and &#352;indi&#263;. There also seems to be a continuing development of theoretical perspectives and concepts that serves as bridges between international policy and ECEC. According to the studies reported in this special issue, ECEC teachers are in fact increasingly recognising children&#8217;s agency and addressing sustainability in an integrated way. This perspective is also visible in the article by Spiteri. Two articles contribute with theoretical perspectives on art immersion by Chapman and O&#8217;Gorman and on the concept of &#8216;community&#8217; by Lecusay, Mrak and Nilsson.</p>
