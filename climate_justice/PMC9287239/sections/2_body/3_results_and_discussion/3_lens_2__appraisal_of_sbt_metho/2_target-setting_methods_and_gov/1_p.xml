<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par40">Aden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] provided a brief overview of the seven methods that the SBTi originally referred companies to (before it began recommending just the ACA and SDA), followed by more in-depth method characterizations by Faria and Labutong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Bj&#248;rn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These studies establish that the seven SBT methods vary in their target equations and application of global emission scenarios linked to the Paris temperature goal. Across the seven methods, Bj&#248;rn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] identified six different principles for allocating global allowable emissions to individual companies, with each method reflecting up to four principles and all methods relying on the &#8220;Grandfathering&#8221;&#160;principle. Some allocation principles are defined by a method&#8217;s target equation, while others are defined by the adopted emission scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In this regard, Faria and Labutong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] show that SBTs can be as sensitive to the choice of emission scenario as the choice target equation. Note that the recent sector-specific methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] are not considered by these studies.</p>
