Hence defining degrowth as a society with a smaller metabolism (energy and material throughput an economy) only portrays one side of the coin (Kallis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>). Degrowth signifies a society with different structures that serve different functions, needs and relations. The emphasis is on a good life, care, wellbeing, community and living well with less for all, implying redistribution and more equal sharing of resources globally (O&#8217;Neill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>; Raworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2012</xref>). The relevance of direct democracy and local autonomy is central (Parrique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2019</xref>) as is the need to define our limits autonomously, collectively, and democratically (Kallis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). Finally, the degrowth perspective also calls for radical change in infrastructure, technologies and monetary system, with the aim of strengthening sharing and communing, direct democracy, wealth and power redistribution (Kallis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>), and of paving the way for more democratic and decentralised technologies and financial systems (Douthwaite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>; Pensera and Fressoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2019</xref>).</p>
