<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0060">Food insecurity, due to a lack of or limited access to production resources and other livelihood opportunities in rural developing countries, is not unique to women, thus it ought to be understood in a broader context. While women as individuals in rural smallholder communities might face most constraints, the general populations tend to face similar challenges. As pointed out in the introduction, smallholder populations generally are among the most affected by food insecurity and poverty due to multiple constraints in both resources and opportunities. This problem is linked to both local and global inequalities. With respect to local inequality, it must be understood that different households, and by extension women from different households, face different levels of constraints in economic resources and opportunities based on their socio-economic characteristics. Indeed, studies have shown that in the same community there is a variation in smallholder households' socio-economic attributes with some households being relatively resource rich whilst others are significantly deprived. These conditions dictate who is able to participate and benefit from available socio-economic opportunities (<xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Wangu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Wangu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, a variation in socio-economic outcomes, such as meeting their household food security, is to be expected.</p>
