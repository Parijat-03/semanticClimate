Debris left behind by retreating glaciers (moraines) slid or collapsed, or formed fast &#64258;owing water-debris mixtures (debris &#64258;ows) in recent decades, for instance in the European and New Zealand Alps (Zimmermann and Haeberli, 1992; Blair, 1994; Curry et al., 2006; Eichel et al., 2018). Over decades to millennia, or even longer, rock slopes adjacent to or formerly covered by glaciers, became unstable and in some cases, eventually collapsed. Related landslide activity increased in recently deglacierised zones in most high mountains (Korup et al., 2012; McColl, 2012; Deline et al., 2015; Kos et al., 2016; Serrano et al., 2018). For example, according to Cloutier et al. (2017) more than two-thirds of the large landslides that occurred in Northern British Columbia between 1973&#8211;2003, occurred on cirque walls that have been exposed after glacier retreat from the mid-19th century on. Ice-rich permafrost environments following glacial retreat enhanced slope mass movements (Oliva and Ruiz-Fern&#225;ndez, 2015). At lower elevations, re-vegetation and rise of tree limit are able to stabilise shallow slope instabilities (Curry et al., 2006).

In a number of cases, mostly in North America and High Mountain Asia (Bevington and Copland, 2014; Round et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 2018), surge-related glacier advances dammed rivers, causing major &#64258;oods. In rare cases, glacier surges directly inundated agricultural land and damaged infrastructure (Shangguan et al., 2016). Sevestre and Benn (2015) suggest that surging operates within a climatic envelope of temperature and precipitation conditions, and that shifts in these conditions can modify surge frequencies and magnitudes. Some glaciers have reduced or stopped surge activity, or are projected to do so within decades, as a consequence of negative glacier mass balances (Eisen et al., 2001; Kienholz et al., 2017). For such cases, related hazards can also be expected to decrease. In contrast, intensive or increased surge activity (Hewitt, 2007; Gardelle et al., 2012; Yasuda and Furuya, 2015) occurred in a region on and </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.46" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.84; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.61" x1="571.46">around the Western Tibetan plateau which exhibited balanced or even positive glacier mass budgets in recent decades (Brun et al., 2017). Enhanced melt water production was suggested to be able to trigger or enhance surge-type instability, in particular for glaciers that contain ice both at the melting point and considerably below (Dunse et al., 2015; Yasuda and Furuya, 2015; Nuth et al., 2019).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.45" top="651.62"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 651.62; y1: 661.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="651.62" x1="571.45">A rare type of glacier instability with large volumes (in the order of 10&#8211;100&#160;million m</span><span style="x0: 387.71; x1: 390.9; y0: 643.44; y1: 650.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="387.71" y0="643.44" x1="390.9">3</span><span style="x0: 390.9; x1: 393.54; y0: 639.52; y1: 649.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="390.9" y0="639.52" x1="571.49">) and high mobility (up to 200&#8211;300 km/h) results from the complete collapse of large sections of low-angle valley glaciers and subsequent combined ice/rock/debris avalanches. The largest of such glacier collapses have been reported in the Caucasus Mountains in 2002 (Kolka Glacier, ~130 fatalities) (Huggel et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2009), and in the Aru Range in Tibet in 2016 (twin glacier collapses with 9 fatalities) (K&#228;&#228;b et al., 2018). Although there is no evidence that climate change has played a direct role in the 2002 event, changes in glacier mass balance, water input into the glaciers, and the frozen regime of the glacier beds were involved in the 2016 collapses and at least partly linked with climate change (Gilbert et al., 2018).

There is no published evidence found that addresses the links between climate change and accidental avalanches triggered by recreationists or workers. Changes in snow cover characteristics are expected to induce changes in spontaneous avalanche activity including changes in friction and &#64258;ow regime (Naaim et al., 2013; Steinkogler et al., 2014).</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.47" top="291.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.36; y0: 291.54; y1: 301.04; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="291.54" x1="571.47">Ballesteros-C&#225;novas et al.

In the European Alps, avalanche numbers and runout distance have decreased where snow depth decreased and air temperature increased (Teich et al., 2012; Eckert et al., 2013). In the European Alps and Tatras mountains, over past decades, there has been a decrease in avalanche mass and run-out distance and a decrease in avalanches with a powder part; avalanche numbers decreased below 2,000 m a.s.l., and increased above (Eckert et al., 2013; Lavigne et al., 2015; Gadek et al., 2017). A positive trend in the proportion of avalanches involving wet snow in December through February was shown for the last decades (Pielmeier et al., 2013; Naaim et al., 2016). Land use and land cover changes also contributed to changes in avalanches (Garc&#237;a-Hern&#225;ndez et al., 2017; Giacona et al., 2018).
