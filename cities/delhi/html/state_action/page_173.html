Service roads, if present, are not well maintained. Footpaths are either not present or are poorly maintained. Furthermore, there are no specific facilities, other than passenger waiting shelters, provided for buses. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.37" top="698.79"><span x0="72.02" y0="698.79" x1="526.37" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 698.79; y1: 710.79; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Approaches to bus shelters, dedicated bus priority lanes, continuous pedestrian paths, and separate lanes for slow vehicles like bicycles and rickshaws have not been included in the road network designs. As a result, consequently, all road users have to share the carriageway. This often leads to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and slow moving vehicles and congested conditions for motor vehicles. Not surprisingly, government surveys find 50 per cent of the road space in Delhi &#8216;encroached on&#8217; by non-traffic activities. This disrupts traffic in all lanes and makes walking and cycling even more hazardous. Motor traffic does not use the kerb-side lane even when pedestrian and bicycle densities are low. The absence of safe crossing points for pedestrians leads to their trying to run across busy roads between traffic flows, slowing down the motorised traffic besides causing accidents and casualties. Even where zebra crossings have been provided, drivers of motor vehicles do not stop clear of them as a result of which pedestrians have to jay walk through a maze of parked mixed vehicles waiting at the red light in a jumbled manner. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="189.5" top="482.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="482.28" x1="189.5" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.35; y0: 482.28; y1: 494.28; width: 5.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">c) Waste Management </span></div><div left="72.02" right="142.34" top="456.6"><span x0="72.02" y0="456.6" x1="142.34" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 456.6; y1: 468.6; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Solid Waste: </span><span x0="144.62" y0="456.6" x1="314.22" style="x0: 144.62; x1: 155.29; y0: 456.6; y1: 468.6; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">MoEF&amp;CC, GoI has notified the revised Solid Waste management Rules, 2016. As per these rules &#8220;Solid Waste&#8221; means and includes solid or semi-solid domestic waste, sanitary waste, commercial waste, institutional waste, catering &amp; market waste and other non-residential waste, street sweeping, silt removed or collected from surface drains, horticulture waste, agriculture and dairy waste, treated bio-medical waste excluding industrial waste, bio-medical waste and e-waste, battery waste, radio-active waste generated in the area under local authorities etc. As per these rules the responsibility of waste management has been entrusted with the Urban Development Department and the Urban local authorities. As per the data available with DPCC records, solid waste generation in Delhi was around 8,370 TPD. This is slated to increase due to economic and population growth. 455 MGD sewage is also treated, which generates organic sludge. Municipal waste of Delhi is disposed in three landfill sites namely Bhalswa GT Road, Gazipur and Okhla. The technical problems relate to municipal solid waste storage, collection and transportation. But the major problem is in the area of processing and disposal. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.41" top="97.37"><span x0="72.02" y0="97.37" x1="526.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 97.37; y1: 109.37; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">DPCC has granted temporary permission to operate M/s Timarpur Okhla Waste Management Pvt.
