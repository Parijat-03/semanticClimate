Climate change is taking an inevitable toll on food systems, with remote, Indigenous communities disproportionately impacted in Canada. Combining the principles of Two-Eyed Seeing and the Smart Framework, the FEEDS Project provides early detection and potential for mitigation of adverse environmental, food system, and mental health impacts, while enabling data sovereignty and self-governance.</p>
