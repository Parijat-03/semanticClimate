Following the expiration of the Achi targets<xref rid="fn0065" ref-type="fn">13</xref>
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is currently in the process of developing a new framework, which will define new targets for biodiversity conservation. Commonly referred to as post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, it complement the targets specified under SDGs 14 and 15 for protecting and restoring the marine and terrestrial environment (UN 2015), respectively. In addition, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) calls on the international community to meet a land degradation neutrality target, which means that the capacity of land to provide ecosystem goods and services and ensure food security will remain stable or improve over time.<xref rid="fn0070" ref-type="fn">14</xref>
With on key policy decisions on biodiversity conservation under the CBD shifted into 2021 and 2022, there is the opportunity to further integrate ambitions and shape cross cutting solutions, building on and strengthening linkages to outcomes from the United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) and the 26th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2021.<xref rid="fn0075" ref-type="fn">15</xref>
