A full analysis in the domain of social ethics requires us to take other moral considerations into account. There may be institutions that maximize the value of distributive justice but that are nevertheless morally reprehensible in another aspect that is not captured by the distributive justice concerns. And another moral consideration is whether we are respecting the principle that we should be treated as human beings and should not be downgraded and treated as something else. When deciding how we should distribute scarce common resources such as emission rights, the correct distribution of the metric of justice is not the only thing that matters to social ethics; it also matters that we implement a distributive rule that is not dehumanizing. In order to know whether that is the case if we were to live in societies that have institutions that are based on the Moral Equivalence Thesis, we must first ask when a certain rule or institution would be seen as dehumanizing. This requires us to ask the difficult question of what it means to be human.</p>
