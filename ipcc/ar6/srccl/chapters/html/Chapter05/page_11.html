Jessoe et al. (2018) using a&#160;28-year panel on individual employment in rural Mexico, found that years with a&#160;high occurrence of heat lead to a&#160;reduction in local employment by up to&#160;1.4% with a&#160;medium emissions scenario, particularly for wage work and non-farm labour, with impacts on food access. Without employment opportunities in areas where extreme poverty is prevalent, people may be forced to migrate, exacerbating potential for ensuing conflicts (FAO 2018a).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="603.12"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 603.12; y1: 612.62; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="603.12" x1="313.23">Finally, climate change can affect human health in other ways that interact with food utilisation. In many parts of the world where agriculture relies still on manual labour, projections are that heat stress will reduce the hours people can work, and increase their risk (Dunne et al. 2013). For example, Takakura et al. (2017) estimates that under RCP8.5, the global economic loss from people working shorter hours to mitigate heat loss may be&#160;2.4&#8211;4% of GDP.

These people often lack power and access to resources, adequate urban services and functioning infrastructure. As climate events become more frequent and intense, this can increase the scale and depth of urban poverty (Rosenzweig et al. 2018b). Urban floods and droughts may result in water contamination increasing the incidence of diarrhoeal illness in poor children (Bartlett 2008).

That is, the behaviours, tasks, and responsibilities a&#160;society defines as &#8216;male&#8217; or&#160;&#8216;female&#8217;, and the differential gendered access to resources (Paris and Rola-Rubzen 2018; Aberman and Tirado 2014; Lebel&#160;et al.&#160;2014; Bee&#160;2016). In many rural areas women often grow most of the crops for domestic consumption and are primarily&#160;responsible for storing, processing, and preparing food; handling livestock; gathering food, fodder and fuelwood; managing domestic water supply; and providing most of the labour for post-harvest activities (FAO 2011a). They are mostly impacted through increased hardship, implications for household roles, and subsequent organisational responsibilities (Boetto&#160;and&#160;McKinnon 2013; Jost et al. 2016). Water scarcity can particularly affect women because they need to spend more time&#160;and energy to collect water, where they may be more exposed to physical and sexual violence (Sommer et al. 2015; Aipira et al. 2017). They may be forced to use unsafe water in the household increasing risk of water-borne diseases (Parikh 2009). Climate&#160;change also has differentiated gendered impacts on livestock-holders&#8217; food security (McKune et al. 2015; Ongoro and Ogara 2012; Fratkin et al. 2004) (Supplementary Material Table SM5.1). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="227.84" top="159.14"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 85.53; y0: 159.14; y1: 168.64; width: 6.16; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="159.14" x1="227.84">Gender dimensions of the four pillars</span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.93; y0: 147.15; y1: 156.65; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="147.15" x1="299.05">Worldwide, women play a&#160;key role in food security (World Bank 2015) and the four pillars of food security have strong gender dimensions (Thompson 2018).
