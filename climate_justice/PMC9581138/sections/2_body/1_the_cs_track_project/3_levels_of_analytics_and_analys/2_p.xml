Still, there is content information on websites that is even partly represented in the CS Track database (especially project descriptions). Interactions between project members can be retrieved from project-related forums and wiki pages, even in standardized form on platforms such as Zooniverse or SciStarter. This allows for building and analyzing network models from which influential actors or structural characteristics (e.g., hierarchical or reciprocal relationships) can be inferred. It also means that information about project content and activity can be captured. Depending on the level, the potential of applying analytic techniques to external data sources differs in the degree of automation that can be achieved. In this regard, we distinguish three different levels with specific characteristics:</p>
