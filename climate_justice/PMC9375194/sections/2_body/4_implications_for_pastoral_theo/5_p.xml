We deny the climate <italic>emergency</italic>, or even minimize its rapid advance, at our own peril. There is <italic>both</italic> a climate emergency that all of us are facing <italic>and</italic> at the same time there is climate racism and classism, with, for example, Black, Indigenous, and poor communities suffering its effects disproportionately. &#8220;The fact is: inequalities overlap and amplify each other,&#8221; writes Flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>); &#8220;those bearing the brunt of climate change often have the fewest resources and the most constraints on their civil rights, and live in the most polluted places&#8221; (p. 449).
