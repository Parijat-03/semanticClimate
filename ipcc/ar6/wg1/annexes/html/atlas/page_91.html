The GCM-driven simulations available in 41 the NA-CORDEX archive (Mearns et al., 2017) are discussed, focusing on simulations that used RCP8.5 for 42 future projections (Bukovsky and Mearns, submitted).  43 44 The current period (1970&#8211;1999) is compared to the future at the end of the 21st century (2070&#8211;2099). 45 Bukovsky and Mearns (submitted) focus on the differences in the climate changes in relation to the TCR 46 (Transient Climate Response) of the driving models. Karmalkar (2018) noted that the NA-CORDEX model 47 set does a better job of covering subregional ranges of temperature change from the CMIP5 GCMs than 48 NARCCAP did for the CMIP3 models. Two RCMs driven by the same three GCMs with TCRs that span the 49 range of the CMIP5 models are highlighted here (Figure Atlas.44:). Domain-wide changes in temperature 50 follow the TCR of the global models (low &#8211; GFDL, medium &#8211; MPI-LR, high &#8211; HadGEM2), and this 51 association continues down to the grid-point level. Moreover, there is a tendency for WRF to produce higher 52 domain-wide changes than RegCM, suggesting that at least in some cases there is evidence for different 53 RCMs having something akin to a TCR (Figure Atlas.44:) (Bukovsky and Mearns, submitted).
