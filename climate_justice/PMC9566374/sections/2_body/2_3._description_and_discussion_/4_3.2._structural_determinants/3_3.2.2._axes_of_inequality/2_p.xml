<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It should be noted that the different axes of inequality do not exist in isolation, but that people are crossed by all of them, creating different social realities [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These axes interact with individual vulnerabilities that also affect intermediate determinants and health impacts. For example, in cities with a Mediterranean climate, there is a high percentage of elderly people. This is especially the case in northern Mediterranean cities, such as those in France, Spain, Italy and Greece, countries of the European Union with the highest levels of life expectancy [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The shares of women aged 65 in these countries are 23%, 23%, 26% and 25%, respectively, and in the case of men 19%, 18%, 21% and 20%, respectively [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Among the elderly population, there are more frail people; the biological effect of age interacts with the social effect, defining what it means to be elderly in our society, including lower participation in society and possible discrimination (ageism). Moreover, in this age group, women outnumber men. Older women are more susceptible to heat due to poorer age-related thermoregulation, while at the same time having fewer economic and social resources to protect themselves from heat due to their gender and age.</p>
