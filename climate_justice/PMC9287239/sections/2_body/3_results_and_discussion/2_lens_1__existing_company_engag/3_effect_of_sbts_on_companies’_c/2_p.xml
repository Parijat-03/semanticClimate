[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] further assessed whether companies with SBTs increase their investments in emission reduction initiatives. Companies with SBTs reported 113% higher investments as compared to companies with internal targets and 63% higher investments as compared to companies with similar exogenous covariates (e.g., past target ambition, past target achievement) and factor variables (e.g., sector, country) likely to influence SBT adoption, confirming that increased investments are not driven by differences between the two groups of companies. In contrast, companies that set more ambitious internal targets did not invest more than companies that set less ambitious internal targets, indicating that increased investment is attributable to SBT adoption rather than setting ambitious targets. We note, however, that the study did not assess whether the level and type of investments typically associated with SBTs is sufficient for subsequently meeting the SBTs (addressed below). Freiberg et al.&#8217;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] findings that SBT adoption is accompanied by increased target difficulty and higher investment further suggest a substantive rather than symbolic commitment.</p>
