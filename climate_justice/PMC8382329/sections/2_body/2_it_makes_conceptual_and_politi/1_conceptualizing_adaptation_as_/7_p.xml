For example, Long and Woolley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2009</xref>) argue that such an interpretation of GPGs is rhetorically effective, but poorly defined, lacking in conceptual clarity. Here, we take on refuting the critiques of adaptation as a GPG. First, the initial understanding of public goods under neoclassical framing by Samuelson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1954</xref>) was national, territory-bounded (Sandmo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2006</xref>), as in those days no global externality or borderless climate risks were on the global agenda. Cross-border externality problems now represent a group of GPBs, requiring their collective internalization into national and global policy processes. Even the widening disparity and concentration of poverty in middle-income countries are now viewed by some as a GPB, warranting collective solution (Sumner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2012</xref>).</p>
