<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Regarding the associations observed between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> and the incidence rate of COVID-19, despite the fact that our results have shown a higher incidence rate in those territories with a higher average concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or PM<sub>10</sub>, the estimates were modest compared to previous studies [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some of the studies described in Bhaskar&#8217;s review have mentioned an average exposure to air pollutants higher than ours; perhaps we could have found association measures (i.e., incidence rate ratios) close to those studies if we had had higher concentrations of air pollutants.</p>
