Regional climate projections can be separated into two&#160;components: the regional-scale forced response or regional-scale climate sensitivity when normalized by the global mean temperature change (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020) and the climate internal variability characterizing the future period or global warming level under scrutiny. This section assesses a&#160;few methodological aspects related to robustness and emergence properties of the regional-scale forced response as well as the possible influence of internal variability on the emergence of the anthropogenic signal.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="224.14" top="222.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="222.48" x1="224.14" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 222.48; y1: 232.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.3.1 Robustness of the Anthropogenic Signal&#160;at&#160;Regional&#160;Scale</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="186.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="186.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Standard methodologies to derive the regional forced response include pattern-scaling and the time-shift or epoch approach (Section&#160;4.2.4; Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014; Vautard et&#160;al., 2014; Herger et&#160;al., 2015; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018; Christensen et&#160;al., 2019). Pattern-scaling assumes that the spatial patterns of regional change, often based on a&#160;time-averaged 20- or 30-year period at the end of the 21st&#160;century, are roughly constant in time, and simply scale linearly with global mean warming. The time-shift approach defines a&#160;target in terms of global warming level (GWL) and locates the time segment, usually 20&#160;or 30 years, in historical or scenario simulations in which global mean warming matches the required GWL (Section&#160;10.1.2 and Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11.1).

Importantly, pattern scaling cannot account for the non-linearity arising from either interacting quasi-linear processes (Chadwick and Good, 2013) and purely non-linear mechanisms, which have been shown to be present in CMIP5 models for high GWL (4&#176;C) and affect precipitation more than temperature at the regional-scale (Section&#160;8.5.3.1; Good et&#160;al., 2015, 2016). The time-shift approach can also be used to test whether regional climate change patterns depend on the rate of global mean warming and external forcing pathways, in addition to global warming magnitude. A&#160;global evaluation of both approaches in projecting the forced temperature and precipitation response for a&#160;highly mitigated scenario based on a&#160;moderately mitigated one has been performed using a&#160;perfect-model framework (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018). The amplitude of errors for both approaches appears to be substantially smaller than model uncertainty approximated by the CMIP5 multi-model spread.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="510.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="510.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Based on large and coordinated modelling exercises such as CMIP5 and CORDEX, the time-shift approach has been largely used to assess differences in regional climate impacts for different GWLs, with a&#160;strong focus on 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C (Karmalkar and Bradley, 2017; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Karnauskas et&#160;al., 2018; W. Liu et&#160;al., 2018; Taylor et&#160;al., 2018; Weber et&#160;al., 2018; Chapter&#160;3, SR1.5, Hoegh-Guldberg et&#160;al., 2018). Comparisons between pattern-scaling and time-shift approaches allow assessment of the scalability of the regional climate change signal and the extent to which pattern-scaling assumptions still hold at regional scale for a&#160;wide range of GWL. This was the approach followed by Matte et&#160;al. (2019) in their assessment of the scalability of European regional climate projections. Based on EURO-CORDEX projections, they performed a&#160;detailed comparison between the pattern scaling and the GWL spatial patterns (GWL range: 1&#176;C, 2&#176;C and 3&#176;C) for different seasons, regional model resolutions, and both temperature and precipitation. High pattern correlation values (greater than 0.9) are found between the scaled pattern and all GWL patterns for temperature. In the case of precipitation, the correspondence is slightly lower, especially in summer, for high GWLs (2&#176;C and 3&#176;C) and much lower for 1&#176;C.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="258.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="258.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.26; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Figure&#160;10.14 illustrates a&#160;similar comparison based on the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble forced with the scenario SSP5-8.5 and applied to two large-scale continental areas. The forced response to anthropogenic forcing is simply taken as the CMIP6 multi-model mean of future regional climate change relative to the 1850&#8211;1900 reference period. Robustness of the forced response is based on both significance of the change and model agreement about the sign (direction) of change (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1; Figure&#160;10.14). Caution has to be exercised against a&#160;too literal interpretation of lack of robust change given that significance and sign agreement can be sensitive to spatial and temporal aggregation (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure&#160;2) and lack of a&#160;robust change does not necessarily translate to lack of regional-scale climate change impacts (McSweeney and Jones, 2013; Hibino and Takayabu, 2016).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="78.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="78.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">If projected regional mean temperature (Figure&#160;10.14a) and precipitation (Figure&#160;10.14b) changes were to scale linearly with global mean warming, the adjusted spatial patterns would be congruent </span></div></body></html>
