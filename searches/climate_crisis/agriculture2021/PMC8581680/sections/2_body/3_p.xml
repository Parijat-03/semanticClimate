Victoria is currently completing an intercalated master&#8217;s degree in Clinical Health Psychology and recruited the remaining members of the team: Amanda Madera (BSc Biology, MPH Global Health), Hannah McPhee (BSc Biomedical Science, Year 2 Medicine), Rhiannon Wells (MSc Global Health, Year 4 Medicine) and Riley Westwood (Year 1 Medicine). Between them, the group have experience of living, working and volunteering in differing healthcare systems and health environments, including Northern Ireland, Germany, the Falkland Islands, India and East Africa. The student team engaged actively with faculty within the SMDBS, establishing regular review meetings for support, updates and information sharing, and along with the students, the staff have been committed and enthusiastic about addressing health inequalities, providing planetary health education, and tackling the climate crisis.</p>
