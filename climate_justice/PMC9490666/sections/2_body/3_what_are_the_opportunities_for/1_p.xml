The actions we take should be guided by the principles of climate justice and a &#8220;just transition.&#8221; Historically, high-income countries (HICs) have made the largest contribution of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere and as such need to rapidly decarbonize to help mitigate the worst effects of climate change. LMICs have contributed less and are often more at risk, but while they may still rely heavily on fossil fuels as a source of energy, they should not be left behind in the global transition to clean energy and environmentally sustainable economies.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
