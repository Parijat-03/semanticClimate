<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par3">Australia is one of the countries with the highest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In 2017, its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 1.5 times higher than the level recorded in 1990. Moreover, between 1990 and 2017, the country&#8217;s per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased from 16.3 to 17 tons, and these values were four times greater than the global per capita emissions (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Additionally, the country&#8217;s economy is heavily dependent on energy. Australia is a net coal exporter in the region, and almost all economic activities are dependent on oil, natural gas, and coal. Therefore, in this context, Australia bears similarities with the USA rather than with Germany, Denmark, and Spain among developed nations. In general, the energy and environment-related dynamics of the country are parallel to developing nations rather than developed ones.</p>
