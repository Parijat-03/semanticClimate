<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">AB 1550 minimally reallocated interventions to communities with diverse forms of vulnerability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g005">Fig 5</xref>). AB 1550 was created to redistribute adaptations to low income communities that do not qualify as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; under CES. After AB 1550, census tracts considered vulnerable under CES received a 4.9 percentage point decrease in heat-related CCI-funded tract interventions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and a 5.1 percentage point increase in all CCI-funded tract interventions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Low income communities that are not disadvantaged under CES saw a 2.2 percentage point increase and a 2.7 percentage point increase in intervention fractions, respectively. Tracts that are neither &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; nor low income saw a 2.7 percentage point increase for heat-related interventions and a 7.8 percentage point decrease for all tract interventions after AB 1550. Hence, intervention allocation experienced minor changes after the enactment of AB 1550.</p>
