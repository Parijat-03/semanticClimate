Recent estimates (Song et al. 2018) owing to semantic and methodological differences (see Chapter&#160;1, Section&#160;1.1.2.3) suggest that global tree cover has increased over the period 1982&#8211;2016, which contradicts the forest area dynamics assessed by FAO (2016) and Lindquist and&#160;D&#8217;Annunzio (2016).

The net impact of these changes on GHG emissions and removals, relative to a&#160;scenario without forest mitigation actions, needs to be quanti&#64257;ed, (e.g.,&#160;Werner et al. 2010; Smyth et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2018). Therefore, reductions in forest ecosystem carbon stocks alone are an incomplete estimator of the impacts of forest management on the atmosphere (Nabuurs et al. 2007; Lempri&#232;re et al. 2013; Kurz et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018b). The impacts of forest management and the carbon storage in long-lived products and land&#64257;lls vary greatly by region, however, because of the typically much shorter lifespan of wood products produced from tropical regions compared to temperate and boreal regions (Earles et al. 2012; Lewis et al. 2019; Iordan et al. 2018) (Section&#160;4.8.4).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.06" top="543.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 543.56; y1: 553.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="543.56" x1="566.06">Assessments of forest degradation based on remote sensing of changes in canopy density or land cover, (e.g., Hansen et al. 2013; Pearson et al. 2017) quantify changes in above-ground biomass carbon stocks and require additional assumptions or model-based analyses to also quantify the impacts on other ecosystem carbon pools including below-ground biomass, litter, woody debris and soil carbon. Depending on the type of disturbance, changes in above-ground biomass may lead to decreases or increases in other carbon pools, for example, windthrow and insect-induced tree mortality may result in losses in above-ground biomass that are (initially) offset by corresponding increases in dead organic matter carbon pools (Yamanoi et al. 2015; Kurz et al. 2008), while deforestation will reduce the total ecosystem carbon pool (Houghton et al. 2012). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="375.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 375.59; y1: 385.09; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="375.59" x1="566.07">A global study of current vegetation carbon stocks (450&#160;Gt&#160;C), relative to a&#160;hypothetical condition without land use (916&#160;Gt&#160;C), attributed 42&#8211;47% of carbon stock reductions to land management effects without land-use change, while the remaining 53&#8211;58% of carbon stock reductions were attributed to deforestation and other land-use changes (Erb et al. 2018). While carbon stocks in European forests are lower than hypothetical values in the complete absence of human land use, forest area and carbon stocks have been increasing over recent decades (McGrath et al. 2015; Kauppi et al. 2018). Studies by Gingrich et al. (2015) on the long-term trends in land use over nine European countries (Albania, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom) also show an increase in forest land and reduction in cropland and grazing land from the 19th century to the early 20th century. However, the extent to which human activities have affected the productive capacity of forest lands is poorly understood. Biomass Production Ef&#64257;ciency (BPE),&#160;i.e.&#160;the fraction of photosynthetic production used for biomass production, was signi&#64257;cantly higher in managed forests (0.53) compared to natural forests (0.41) (and it was also higher in managed (0.63) compared to natural (0.44) grasslands) (Campioli et al. 2015). Managing lands for production may involve trade-offs. For example, a&#160;larger proportion of NPP in managed forests is allocated to biomass carbon storage, but lower allocation to &#64257;ne roots is hypothesised to reduce soil carbon stocks in the long term (Noormets et al. 2015). Annual volume increment in Finnish forests has more than doubled over the last century, due to increased growing stock, improved forest management and environmental changes (Henttonen et al. 2017). </span></div></body></html>
