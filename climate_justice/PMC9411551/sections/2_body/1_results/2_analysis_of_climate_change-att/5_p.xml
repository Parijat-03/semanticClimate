For climate change-attributed damages but not climate change-attributed depths, we found evidence of a curvilinear (convex) effect for the appraised value of the parcel, but effect sizes were relatively small. We also found that mobile homes experienced less flood depths but this was not statistically significant for flood damages. Finally, we did not find statistically significant relationships for census tracts with a high proportion of non-Latina/x/o blacks or non-Latina/x/o of other races, including for moderating relationships with income.</p>
