(2013b), McLeod et&#160;al. (2017), Abiodun et&#160;al. (2012), Keys (2012)). Forests, for example, provide water vapour to the atmosphere which supports terrestrial precipitation downwind (Ellison et&#160;al. 2017; Layton and Ellison 2016; Spracklen et&#160;al. 2012, 2018). Within a few days, water vapour can travel several hundred kilometres before being condensed into rain and potentially being transpired again (Makarieva et&#160;al. 2009). This cascading moisture recycling (succession of evapotranspiration, water vapour transport and condensation-rainfall) has been observed in South America (Spracklen et&#160;al. 2018; Zemp et&#160;al. 2014; Staal et&#160;al. 2018; Spracklen et&#160;al. 2012). Deforestation can thus potentially decrease rainfall downwind, while combining &#8216;small-scale&#8217; forestation and irrigation, which in the semi-arid region is susceptible to boost the precipitation-recycling mechanism with </span></div><div left="337.89" right="571.79" top="255.56"><span style="x0: 337.89; x1: 342.46; y0: 255.56; y1: 265.06; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="337.89" y0="255.56" x1="571.79">better vegetation growth downwind (Ellison et&#160;al. 2017; Layton and Ellison, 2016) (Figure 2.22).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="219.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.28; y0: 219.57; y1: 229.07; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="219.57" x1="571.8">3. Many studies using global climate models have reported that the climatic changes resulting from changes in land are not limited to the lower part of the atmosphere, but can reach the upper levels via changes in large-scale ascent (convection) or descent (subsidence) of air. This coupling to the upper atmosphere triggers perturbations in large-scale atmospheric transport (of heat, energy and water) and subsequent changes in temperature and rainfall in regions located quite far away from the original perturbation (Lagu&#235; and Swann 2016; Feddema et&#160;al. 2005, Badger and Dirmeyer 2016; Garcia 2016; Stark 2015; Devaraju 2018; Quesada et&#160;al. 2017a) (Figure 2.23). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="75.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 75.59; y1: 85.09; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="75.59" x1="571.76">De Vrese et&#160;al.
