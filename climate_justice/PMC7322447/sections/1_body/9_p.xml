<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para130">BLM rests on the simple idea that if the people who are affected by racial injustice come together and say &#8220;no more&#8221;, the pressure to change will be irresistible. Environmental justice works in a similar way. If the people most affected by environmental degradation fight back, it becomes harder for destructive industries to make and conceal their messes in places where the wealthy and powerful elites don't go.</p>
