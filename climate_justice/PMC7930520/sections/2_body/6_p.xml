Bessant tracks the &#8216;negative and often pejorative ways&#8217; (p. 154) in which student activism was represented in press coverage and in social scientific interpretations of students&#8217; activism. A range of reductive interpretive frames were placed over student protest&#8212;from explanations focussing on &#8216;intergenerational conflict&#8217; and &#8216;poor impulse control&#8217; (p. 155) to assumptions that young people were &#8216;communist dupes&#8217; (p. 157). These single-sided interpretations by &#8216;expert&#8217; commentators, according to Bessant, &#8216;failed to perceive the possibility that protesters could be protesting about issues that were important to them&#8217; (p. 162), and &#8216;did not engage with the specifically political moral issues that moved them to act&#8217; (p. 165). Protest actions of secondary and tertiary students of this period, according to Bessant, &#8216;demonstrated that young people were very well able to engage in continuing creative and well-organised political practices&#8217;, notwithstanding &#8216;the predominantly hostile responses that their activism provoked&#8217; (p. 180).</p>
