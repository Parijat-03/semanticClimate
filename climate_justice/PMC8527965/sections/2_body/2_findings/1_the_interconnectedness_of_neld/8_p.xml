The Samoan phrase <italic>E atoa lio le masina</italic> likens life to the roundness of the moon. This view is underpinned by the notion of the <italic>va-tapuia</italic> which according to Aiono Le Tagaloa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>) and Tamasese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>) is a force that exists between the living and the dead, and between human and physical aspects of the environment such as land, sea, sky, plants and animals. Tamasese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>, p. 18) discusses the literal meaning of <italic>va-tapuia</italic>, which is <italic>tapu-ia</italic> (sacred) and <italic>va</italic> (relationship) between human and all things animate and inanimate. <italic>Va-tapuia</italic> dictates how Samoans behave in their environment. These behavioural norms give rise to the principle of <italic>va-fealoai</italic> (mutual respect) that permeates human interaction with all elements of the environment. It is, therefore, clear how these understandings may translate to centering interconnectivity in the comprehension and experience of NELD.</p>
