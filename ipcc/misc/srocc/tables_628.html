      <td>Mitigation: No studies available to assess the global impact (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by\ndiversifying and increasing flexibility in the food system to climate stressors and shocks while simultaneously creating\neconomic alternatives for the poor (thereby strengthening adaptive capacity) and lowering expenditures of food\nprocessors and retailers by reducing losses (Muller et al. 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.27). Desertification: No studies\navailable to assess the global impact (Table 6.35 and Table 6.43). Land degradation: Potentially large benefits, as\nover 4 Mkm2 is currently certified for sustainable forest production, which could increase in future (Table 6.44). Food\nsecurity: Moderate benefits by diversifying markets and developing value-added products in the food supply system, by\nincreasing its economic performance and revenues to local farmers (Reidsma et al. 2010), by strengthening the capacity\nof food production chains to adapt to future markets and to improve income of smallholder farmers (Murthy and Madhava\nNaidu 2012) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.51). It may also provide more direct links between producers and consumers.</td>

Adaptation: Large benefits for small farmers by\nreducing costs and increasing their resilience to climate change (Table 6.27). Desertification and land degradation:\nThere are no studies assessing global potential (Tables 6.35 and 6.43). Food security: Large benefits, largely by\nimproving efficiency for 2.5 million people still using traditional biomass for energy (Chapter 5 and Table 6.51).</td>
