      <td>Bookkeeping/accounting models calculate changes in biomass and soils that result from changes in land activity using data\non biomass density and rates of growth/decomposition, typically from ground-based inventory data collection (field measurements\nof carbon in trees and soils) (Houghton et al. 2012; Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017). The approach includes only\nthose changes directly caused by major categories of land-use change and management. The models do not explicitly include the\nindirect effects to changing environmental conditions, although some effects are implicit in the biomass, growth rates and decay rates\nused. Thus, the models may overestimate past fluxes. The bookkeeping models include fluxes from peatland burning based on GFED\nestimates (Randerson et al. 2015).</td>

      <td>DGVMs simulate ecological processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, allocation, growth, decomposition etc., driven by\nenvironmental conditions (climate variability, climate change, CO , nitrogen concentrations). Models vary with respect to the\n2\nprocesses included, with many since AR5 now including forest management, fire, nitrogen and other management (Sitch et al. 2005;\nLe Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018). Models are forced with increasing atmospheric CO and changing climate, and run with and without &#8216;land use\n2\nchange&#8217; (land cover and forest harvest) to differentiate the anthropogenic effects from the indirect effects of climate and CO : the &#8216;land\n2\nsink&#8217;. Thus, indirect effects are explicitly included. This approach also includes a &#8216;lost atmospheric sink capacity&#8217;, or the carbon uptake due\nto environmental effects on forests that does not happen once the forests are removed (Pongratz et al. 2010).</td>

      <td>Integrated assessment models (IAMs) use storylines to construct alternative future scenarios of GHG emissions and atmospheric\nconcentrations within a global socio-economic framework, including projections of AFOLU based on assumptions of, for example, crop\nyields, population growth and bioenergy use (Cross-Chapter Box 1 and Chapter 1). Some models include simplified DGVMs, which may\ninclude climate and CO effects, while others use AFOLU emissions from other sources.\n2</td>

      <td>ESMs couple DGVMs, surface hydrology, and energy exchange models with atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice models, enabling\nexploration of feedbacks between climate change and the carbon cycle (e.g., warming effects increase soil and plant respiration\nand lead to higher atsmpheric CO concentrations, which in turn promote plant growth) (Friedlingstein et al. 2014). They sometimes\n2\ninclude numerical experiments with and without land-use change to diagnose the anthropogenic AFOLU flux (Lawrence et al. 2016).</td>

      <td>Satellite data can be used as a proxy for plant activity (e.g., greenness) and to map land cover, vegetation fires and biomass\ndensity. Algorithms, models and independent data are used to calculate fluxes of CO from satellite data, although calculating the\n2\nnet carbon flux is difficult because of the lack of information on the respiratory flux. Some active satellite sensors (LiDAR) are able\nto measure three-dimensional structure in woody vegetation, which is closely related to biomass density (Zarin et al. 2016; Baccini\net al. 2012; Saatchi et al. 2011). Together with land-cover change data, these estimates of biomass density can be used to provide</td>
