These LSLAs are de&#64257;ned by acquisition of more than 200&#160;ha per deal&#160; (Messerli et al. 2014a). Klaus Deininger (2011) links the growth in demand for land to the 2007&#8211;2008 food price spike, and demonstrates that high levels of demand for land at the country level are statistically associated with weak recognition of land rights. Land grabs, where LSLAs occur despite local use of lands, are often driven by direct collaboration of politicians, government of&#64257;cials and land agencies (Koechlin et al. 2016), involving corruption of governmental land agencies, failures to register community land claims and illegal lands uses, and lack of the rule of law and enforcement in resource extraction frontiers (Borras&#160;Jr et al. 2011). Though data is poor, overall, small- and medium-scale domestic investment has in fact been more important than foreign investment (Deininger 2011; Cotula et al. 2014). There are variations in estimates of the scale of LSLAs: Nolte et al. (2016) concluded that deals totalled 42.2&#160;million ha worldwide. Cotula et al. (2014) using cross-checked data for completed lease agreements in Ethiopia, Ghana and Tanzania conclude that they cover 1.9%, 1.9% and 1.1% respectively of each country&#8217;s total land suitable for agriculture. The literature expresses different views on whether these acquisitions concern marginal lands or lands already in use, thereby displacing existing users (Messerli et al. 2014b). Land-grabbing is associated with, and may be motivated by, the acquisition of rights to water, and erosion of those rights for other users such as those downstream (Mehta et al. 2012). Quanti&#64257;cation of the acquisition of water rights resulting from LSLAs raises major issues of de&#64257;nition, data availability, and measurement. One estimate of the total acquisition of gross irrigation water associated with land-grabbing across the 24&#160;countries most affected is 280&#160;billion m</span><span style="x0: 211.15; x1: 214.34; y0: 379.44; y1: 386.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="211.15" y0="379.44" x1="215.91">3 </span><span style="x0: 215.89; x1: 218.53; y0: 375.52; y1: 385.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="215.89" y0="375.52" x1="278.59">(Rulli et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="351.53"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 67.09; y0: 351.53; y1: 361.03; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="351.53" x1="307.6">While some authors see LSLAs as investments that can contribute to more ef&#64257;cient food production at larger scales (World Bank 2011; Deininger and Byerlee 2012), others have warned that local food security may be threatened by them (Daniel 2011; Golay and Biglino 2013; Lavers 2012). Reports suggest that recent land-grabbing has affected 12&#160;million people globally in terms of declines in welfare (Adnan 2013; Davis et al. 2014). De Schutter (2011) argues that large-scale land acquisitions will:&#160;a) result in types of farming less liable to reduce poverty than smallholder systems,&#160;b) increase local vulnerability to food price shocks by favouring export agriculture and&#160;c) accelerate the development of a&#160;market for land, with detrimental impacts on smallholders and those depending on common property resources. Land-grabbing can threaten not only agricultural lands of farmers, but also protected ecosystems, like forests and wetlands (Hunsberger et al. 2017; Carter et al. 2017; Ehara et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="147.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 147.56; y1: 157.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="147.56" x1="307.57">The primary mechanisms for combating LSLAs have included restrictions on the size of land sales (Fairbairn 2015), pressure on agribusiness companies to agree to Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, known as VGGT, or similar principles (Collins 2014; Goetz 2013), attempts to repeal biofuels standards (Palmer 2014), strengthening of existing land law and land registration systems (Bebbington et al. 2018), use of community </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 324.91; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.57" x1="566.12">monitoring systems (Sheil et al. 2015), and direct protests against land acquisitions (Hall et al. 2015; Fameree 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="699.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 699.57; y1: 709.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="699.57" x1="566.1">Table&#160;7.7 sets out, in highly summarised form, some key &#64257;ndings on the multi-directional inter-relations between land tenure and climate change, with particular reference to developing countries. The rows represent different categories of landscape or resource systems. For each system the second column summarises current understandings on land tenure and sustainable development, in many cases predating concerns over climate change. The third column summarises the most important implications of land tenure systems, policy about land tenure, and the implementation of that policy, for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and the fourth column gives a&#160;similar summary for mitigation of climate change. The &#64257;fth column summarises key &#64257;ndings on how climate change and climate action (both adaptation and mitigation) will impact land tenure, and the &#64257;nal column, &#64257;ndings on implications of climate change for evolving land policy.</span></div></body></html>
