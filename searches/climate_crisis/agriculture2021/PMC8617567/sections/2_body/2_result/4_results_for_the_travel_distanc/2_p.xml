<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">With two competing models (Models 3.1 and 3.2 in Table&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>) that are informationally indistinguishable (&#8710;AICc&#160;&lt;&#160;2), we selected Model 3.1 as the top model to describe how different factors affected the travel distance to park, given that both competing models have the same number of variables incorporated and Model 3.1 has a better predictive accuracy of 0.405. We found people traveled a longer distance to parks in some counties with higher COVID&#8208;19 positive cases of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, this pattern diminished gradually from June&#8211;September (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). For the wildfire effects, we found the travel distance to park is positively correlated with distance to wildfire in western Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico in June&#8211;July (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). In August and September, this pattern extended to other parts of the study area, except for the western Montana, Idaho, and Texas. For the effects of the monthly average of maximum smoke, the number of counties with positive correlations decreased significantly from June&#8211;September (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). People traveled further to the parks with less NO<sub>2</sub> level except in Washington and Montana in June&#8211;July and to parks with less SO<sub>2</sub> level except in northern California, Nevada, and Texas in August&#8211;September (Figures&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The effects of other factors such as the number of state parks, climatic variables, and land cover types for the number of visits per capita, median of minimum dwell time at the park, and travel distance to park were given in Figures S2, S3, and S4 in the Supporting Information&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, respectively.</p>
