<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In policy terms, our study shows that climate change as evidenced by rising levels of urban heat will disproportionately impact households that lack assets and electricity, so that socioeconomic status remains useful in terms of identifying those who need assistance to mitigate heat stress. Additionally, there is a need to expand electricity service to underserved populations to ensure that they have some access to cooling appliances. Another important group to focus on are young children, so that policies to make cooling facilities available in local schools might also be considered. Agricultural laborers are also vulnerable to heat in the pre-monsoon period, and this points to the need to pay attention to populations on the urban periphery instead of focusing only on the central city. More broadly, there is an urgent need to expand greenspace and access to electricity to ensure that heat mitigation options become available to all.</p>
