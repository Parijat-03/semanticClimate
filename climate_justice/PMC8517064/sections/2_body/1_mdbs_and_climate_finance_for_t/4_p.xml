Blended finance is defined as the use of development capital to mobilize additional private finance for SDG related goals (Blended Finance website accessed June 22, 2021). Blended finance is a structuring approach&#160;that allows investors with different objectives to invest together while achieving their own aims be it financial returns, social impact or both (Convergence Blended Capital website accessed June 22, 2021). The approach addresses one of the key barriers to private sector investments &#8211; high perceived and real risk. Examples of blended capital structures include concessional loans coupled with commercial debt or equity, grant funding for project design or technical assistance coupled with equity/debt (Convergence Blended Capital Website,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>). The Convergence database has recorded 146 blended finance transactions targeting the agriculture sector and/or SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), representing aggregate committed financing of USD 13.4 billion (Convergence Blended Capital,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>). The main archetype of these blended finance transactions was concessional debt/equity and technical assistance funds with a major focus on agricultural inputs and agri-finance (Convergence Blended Capital,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>).</p>
