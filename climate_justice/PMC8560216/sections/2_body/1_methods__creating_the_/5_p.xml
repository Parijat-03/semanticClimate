Based on our research, we identified approximately 142 environmental podcasts. To assemble this list, the authors reviewed the topics covered by the podcast to be sure that environmental issues are covered, with any nature-focused topics from any discipline. We analyzed lists of podcasts from Apple iTunes, Spotify, and player.fm, as well as searches using Google and Instagram. We acknowledge that this list is not comprehensive. Out of 142 environmentally themed podcasts that were analyzed, based on the podcast host profiles and show notes, 46% of them have White male hosts, 34% have White female hosts, and interestingly 14% have female BIPOC hosts and 6% male BIPOC hosts (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Some podcasts have co-hosts; thus, we counted all hosts in our analysis. While this analysis is subjective, BIPOC hosts tend to self-identify within the podcast descriptions. These host patterns are presented to show a trend, but not to represent a comprehensive synthesis. Markman and Sawyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>, p. 20) reported that &#8220;Results from a web-based survey found that podcasting continues to be dominated by educated, professional males over 30, most of whom are not podcasting full-time.&#8221;<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Environmental podcast host representation </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13412_2021_723_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
