The pandemic has made more apparent the deeply interconnected nature of our well-being and the issues we face. To start with, research has shown that increasing temperatures can lead to increased transmission of infectious disease and animal-borne illnesses (Lustgarten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). Climate change impacts disease in numerous ways. For one, biodiversity loss increases disease transmission (Keesing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>), and the warming climate is reducing biodiversity at an alarming rate (Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>). Furthermore, increased global temperatures expand the geographic regions vulnerable to contagion (Lustgarten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>), and can bring back old viruses that were previously frozen away. This happened in 2016, when a heat wave thawed permafrost leading to an anthrax outbreak in nearby communities (Doucleff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). As climate change exacerbates the spread and frequency of infectious diseases, we can expect environmental-justice communities to be impacted more than others.</p>
