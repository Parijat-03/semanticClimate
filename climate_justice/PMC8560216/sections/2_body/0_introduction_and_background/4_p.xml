In the 1980s, the Brundtland Report defined development as sustainable if it &#8220;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1987</xref>, p. 16). However, this definition of sustainability has been challenged more recently. There has been a lack of representation of people from historically underrepresented communities within the environmental movement in the United States (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>) and a separation of environmental justice from sustainability or conservation efforts. Thus, the environmental movement has not yet adequately pursued all of the elements of true sustainability, or what Agyeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>) calls &#8220;just sustainability.&#8221; As Agyeman explains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>, p. 5), &#8220;the concept of <italic>just sustainability</italic> highlights the pivotal role that justice and equity could and should play within sustainability discourses.&#8221; Pellow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>) calls for critical environmental justice efforts that include four pillars: intersectionality; multi-scalar; focus on social inequity; and recognizing that we are all interdependent.</p>
