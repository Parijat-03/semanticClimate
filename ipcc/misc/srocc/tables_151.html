The terrestrial biosphere\nalso interacts with oceans through processes such as the infl ux of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and particles. These interactions\naffect where and when rain falls and thus irrigation needs for crops, frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and air quality. They are\nmodifi ed by global and regional climate change, decadal, inter-annual and seasonal climatic variations, and weather extremes, as\nwell as human actions on land (e.g., crop and forest management, afforestation and deforestation). This in turn affects atmospheric\ncomposition, surface temperature, hydrological cycle and thus local, regional and global climate. This box introduces some of the\nfundamental land processes governing biophysical and biogeochemical effects and feedbacks to the climate (Box 2.1, Figure 1).</td>

Surface roughness infl uences turbulent exchanges of momentum, energy, water and biogeochemical tracers. Land ecosystems modulate the atmospheric\ncomposition through emissions and removals of many GHGs and precursors of SLCFs, including biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and mineral dust.\nAtmospheric aerosols formed from these precursors affect regional climate by altering the amounts of precipitation and radiation reaching land surfaces through their\nrole in clouds physics.</td>

      <td>&#8216;Biophysical interactions&#8217; are exchanges of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere (Section 2.5). Land warms up\nfrom absorbing solar and long-wave radiation; it cools down through transfers of sensible heat (via conduction and convection) and\nlatent heat (energy associated with water evapotranspiration) to the atmosphere and through long-wave radiation emission from\nthe land surface (Box 2.1, Figure 1). These interactions between the land and the atmosphere depend on land surface characteristics,\nincluding refl ectivity of shortwave radiation (albedo), emissivity of long wave radiation by vegetation and soils, surface roughness\nand soil water access by vegetation, which depends on both soil characteristics and amounts of roots. Over seasonal, inter-annual\nand decadal timescales, these characteristics vary among different land cover and land-use types and are affected by both natural\nprocesses and land management (Anderson et al. 2011). A dense vegetation with high leaf area index, like forests, may absorb more\nenergy than nearby herbaceous vegetation partly due to differences in surface albedo (especially when snow is on the ground).\nHowever, denser vegetation also sends more energy back to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration (Bonan, 2008;\nBurakowski et al., 2018; Ellison et al., 2017) (Section 2.5.2) and this contributes to changes in atmospheric water vapour content, and\nsubsequently to changes in rainfall.</td>

      <td>Particularly in extra-tropical regions, these characteristics exhibit strong seasonal patterns with the development and senescence of the\nvegetation (e.g., leaf colour change and drop). For example, in deciduous forests, seasonal growth increases albedo by 20&#8211;50% from the\nspring minima to growing season maxima, followed by rapid decrease during leaf fall, whereas in grasslands, spring greening causes\nalbedo decreases and only increases with vegetation browning (Hollinger et al. 2010). The seasonal patterns of sensible and latent heat\nfl uxes are also driven by the cycle of leaf development and senescence in temperate deciduous forests: sensible heat fl uxes peak in spring\nand autumn and latent heat fl uxes peak in mid-summer (Moore et al. 1996; Richardson et al. 2013).</td>
