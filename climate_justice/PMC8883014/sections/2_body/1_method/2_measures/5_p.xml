<bold>Generalized Anxiety Disorder symptoms</bold> were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>). The GAD-7 assesses anxiety symptoms based on the criteria for GAD used in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1994</xref>). Participants were asked to report how often during the past two weeks they were bothered by each of the seven symptoms described. Response options ranged from 0&#8201;=&#8201;Not at all to 3&#8201;=&#8201;Nearly every day. Sum scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating greater severity of GAD symptoms, and scores of 10 or greater indicative of probable GAD (Spitzer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>). Reliability in the current sample was good (total score &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.90).</p>
