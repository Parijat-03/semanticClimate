<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">These few pioneering examples resonate with the rallying cry of critical disaster studies, &#8220;there are no natural disasters,&#8221; which emphasizes how vulnerabilities are embedded within broader systems of political, socio&#8208;economic, and material relations (Perry, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0224" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). From this perspective, we support calls for a culturally embedded sensitivity towards processes of change, rather than a shift towards the quantitative assessment of indicators that do not capture the complexity of those relations. There is an evident need for a systematic body of work that engages with the material conditions and experiences of climate change action. However, calls for urgent action and aggregate results at the global level tend to distract our attention towards tried and tested forms of action that, so far, falls short of delivering the radical societal change needed to address climate change in the long term.</p>
