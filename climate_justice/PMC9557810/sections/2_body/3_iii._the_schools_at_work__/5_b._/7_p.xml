development of empathy, but rather with radical ways to see the world, to break
with deeply learnt forms of oppression and control that inadvertently travel
from our bodies into our homes, neighbourhoods, public spaces and cities. Here,
<italic toggle="yes">sentipensar</italic> practices activate new forms of caring and
conviviality. This approach is also clearly expressed in the <italic toggle="yes">Barrio
Intercultural</italic>, where the neighbourhood is conceived, built and
lived as a place for mutuality and conviviality.</p>
