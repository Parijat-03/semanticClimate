For AR6, several of the new CMIP6 (Eyring et&#160;al., 2016a) model intercomparison projects (MIPs) address some of these limitations. The list of MIPs is provided in Chapter&#160;1 (Table&#160;1.3). High-Resolution MIP (HighResMIP; Haarsma et&#160;al., 2016) and Global Monsoons MIP (GMMIP; Zhou et&#160;al., 2016) specifically address the regional climate challenge using global models. HighResMIP focuses on producing global climate projections at a&#160;horizontal resolution of around 50 km grid spacing or finer while GMMIP aims at better understanding and predicting the monsoons.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.77" top="570.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="570.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An alternative to increasing resolution everywhere is offered by variable resolution global models, that is, with regionally finer resolution. They have been developed since the 1970s (Li, 1999), resulting in a&#160;first coordinated effort (SGMIP) by Fox-Rabinovitz et&#160;al. (2006, 2008). They are expected to offer the finest resolution possible in the region of interest, while still resolving the climate processes at the global scale (although at lower resolution). An overview of recent developments is in McGregor (2015). This is a&#160;rapidly developing field (Krinner et&#160;al., 2014; Ferguson et&#160;al., 2016; Huang et&#160;al., 2016) that will possibly contribute to improved future regional projections.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="185.21" top="438.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="438.48" x1="185.21" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 438.48; y1: 448.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.1.2 Regional Climate Models</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="414.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="414.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.67; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional climate models (RCMs) are dynamical models similar to global models that are applied over a&#160;limited area, but with a&#160;horizontal resolution higher than that of standard global models. They are the basis for dynamical downscaling to produce sub-continental climate information (e.g.,&#160;Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas) but are also often used for process understanding. At lateral and, if applicable, lower boundaries, RCMs take their values from a&#160;driving dataset, which could be a&#160;global model or a&#160;reanalysis. RCMs are typically one-way nested: they do not feed back into the driving model, although two-way nested global model-RCM simulations have been performed that examine regional influence on large-scale climate, potentially improving it (Lorenz and Jacob, 2005; Harris and Lin, 2013; Junquas et&#160;al., 2016). Spectral nudging (Kida et&#160;al., 1991; Waldron et&#160;al., 1996; von Storch et&#160;al., 2000; Kanamaru and Kanamitsu, 2007) can increase consistency with the driving model, whereby selected variables, such as the wind field, are forced to closely follow a&#160;prescribed large-scale field over a&#160;specified range of spatial scales. RCMs can inherit biases from the driving global model in addition to producing biases themselves (Hall, 2014; Hong and Kanamitsu, 2014; Dosio et&#160;al., 2015; Takayabu et&#160;al., 2016). The consistency between the circulation features simulated by the RCM and those inherited through the boundary conditions depends on (i) the relative importance of the large-scale forcing compared to local-scale phenomena, and (ii) the size of the RCM domain (e.g.,&#160;Diaconescu and Laprise, 2013). Large domains also allow the RCM to generate much of its own internally generated unforced variability (Nikiema et&#160;al., 2017, and references therein; Sanchez-Gomez and Somot, 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="66.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="66.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 66.6; y1: 76.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) initiative (Giorgi et&#160;al., 2009; Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015; </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.84; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">historical (starting as early as 1950) and future climate projections for various regions. RCMs in CORDEX typically have a&#160;horizontal resolution between 10 and 50 km. But much finer spatial resolution is required to fully resolve deep convection, an important cause of precipitation in much of the world. Therefore, an emerging strand in dynamical downscaling employs simulations at convection permitting scales, at horizontal resolutions of a&#160;few kilometres, where deep-convection parametrizations can be switched off, approximately simulating deep convection (Prein et&#160;al., 2015; Stratton et&#160;al., 2018; Coppola et&#160;al., 2020). A&#160;recent study indicates that switching off the deep-convection parametrization may be beneficial also in simulations performed at coarser resolutions (Vergara-Temprado et&#160;al., 2020). Alternatively, some RCMs make use of scale-aware parametrizations that are able to adapt to increasing resolution without switching off the convection scheme (Hamdi et&#160;al., 2012; De Troch et&#160;al., 2013; Plant and Yano, 2015; Giot et&#160;al., 2016; Termonia et&#160;al., 2018; Yano et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="510.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="510.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.19; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">RCMs have often consisted of atmospheric and land components that do not include all possible Earth system processes and therefore neglect important processes such as air-sea coupling (in standard RCMs sea surface temperatures, SSTs, are prescribed from global model simulations or reanalyses) or the chemistry of aerosol&#8211;cloud interaction (aerosols prescribed with a&#160;climatology), which may influence regional climate projections. Therefore, some RCMs have been extended by coupling to additional components like interactive oceans, sometimes with sea ice (Kjellstr&#246;m et&#160;al., 2005; Somot et&#160;al., 2008; Van Pham et&#160;al., 2014; Sein et&#160;al., 2015; Ruti et&#160;al., 2016; Zou and Zhou, 2016a; Zou et&#160;al., 2017; Samanta et&#160;al., 2018), rivers (Sevault et&#160;al., 2014; Lee et&#160;al., 2015; Di Sante et&#160;al., 2019), glaciers (Kotlarski et&#160;al., 2010), and aerosols (Zakey et&#160;al., 2006; Zubler et&#160;al., 2011; Nabat et&#160;al., 2015). The coupling of these components allows for the investigation of additional climate processes such as regional sea level change (Adloff et&#160;al., 2018), ocean&#8211;land interactions (Lima et&#160;al., 2019; Soares et&#160;al., 2019a), or the impact of high-frequency ocean&#8211;atmosphere coupling on the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones (Flaounas et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="482.04" top="270.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="270.48" x1="482.04" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 270.48; y1: 280.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.1.3 Statistical Approaches to Generate Regional&#160;Climate&#160;Projections</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="234.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="234.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 234.6; y1: 244.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An alternative or addition to dynamical downscaling is the use of statistical approaches to generate regional projections. In AR5 these methods were collectively referred to as statistical downscaling, but their performance assessment has received little attention. A&#160;major conclusion was that a&#160;wide range of different methods exist and a&#160;general assessment of their performance is difficult (Flato et&#160;al., 2014). Since AR5, several initiatives have been launched to improve the understanding of statistical approaches such as VALUE (Validating and Integrating Downscaling Methods for Climate Change Research, now merged into the EURO-CORDEX activities; Maraun et&#160;al., 2015), STaRMIP (Statistical Regionalization Models Intercomparisons and Hydrological Impacts Project; Vaittinada Ayar et&#160;al., 2016) and BADJAM (Bias ADJustment of climate scenarios for Agricultural Model applications; Galmarini et&#160;al., 2019). The performance of different implementations of these approaches will be assessed in&#160;Section&#160;10.3.3.7.</span></div></body></html>
