However, theories of distributive justice make very few links to philosophical anthropology; moreover, there are methodological challenges in making the insights of philosophical anthropology fit into the detailed and fine-grained categories and distinctions used by analytical philosophers working on distributive justice. Yet philosophical anthropology can help us to develop the argument from human self-understanding that leads to a rejection of the Moral Equivalence Thesis. The starting point of the argument from human self-understanding is that human beings understand themselves not merely as rational agents who can act purposefully but also (though evidently not exclusively) as human animals. As animals, we are a procreating species. As humans, we engage in thinking, reasoning, arguing, being creative, caring about morality, and reinterpreting and giving meaning to urges that flow from the animal side of our being. We see ourselves not as robots or as disembodied souls, but rather as members of the human species&#8212;a species that procreates and has developed many social practices and traditions that give meaning to parenting and to kinship. Thinking of having a baby as merely an individual choice is misleading, because our procreative decisions take place against this context in which we understand ourselves as a member of a species that engages in parenting and kinship relationships as meaningful social practices and traditions. This membership is not only important for our identity but also so that we are able to see ourselves as humans that belong to humanity. The denial of this membership via the design of a social institution or policy is dehumanizing, and hence is a reason to morally condemn such an institution or policy.</p>
