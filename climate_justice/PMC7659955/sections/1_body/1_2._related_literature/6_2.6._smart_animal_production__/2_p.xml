<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Yanmaz et al. [<xref rid="B56-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] suggested adopting thermography in the early detection of lameness in horses. Two types of thermography are&#8212;contact and contactless types. Contactless thermography has higher precisions via infrared radiation. Internal temperature of the affected animal part can be viewed on a medical thermogram, so that treatment can be planned early. Similarly, temperature around a sick cattle&#8217;s gluteal region differs significantly from those of other parts when studied using thermal infrared scanning [<xref rid="B57-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As reported by Steensels et al. [<xref rid="B58-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], temperature management in poultry, as well as early mastitis identification are some other areas where thermal scanning was reported to be useful.</p>
