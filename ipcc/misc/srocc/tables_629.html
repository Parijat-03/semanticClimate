      <td>Mitigation: There are no studies assessing the global potential (Table 6.20). Adaptation: Large benefits through helping\nhouseholds to buffer income fluctuations and providing a broader range of options for the future (Table 6.28; Ahmed\nand Stepp 2016; Thornton and Herrero 2014). Desertification: There are no studies assessing the global potential,\nalthough there are anecdotal reports of limited benefits from improved land management resulting from diversification\n(Batterbury 2001; Herrmann and Hutchinson 2005; Stringer et al. 2009) (Table 6.36). Land degradation: Limited benefits,\nfor example, improved land-use mosaics (Palacios et al. 2013), larger-scale adoption in China&#8217;s Sloping Land Conversion\nProgram to diversify income and reduce degradation has impacted on 0.1 Mkm2 (Liu and Lan 2015) (Table 6.44). Food\nsecurity: Large benefits since many of the world&#8217;s 700 million smallholders practice diversification, helping to provide\neconomic access to food (Morton 2007) (Table 6.52).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: There are no studies assessing the global potential (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits given that\n60 to 100% of seeds used in various countries of the global South are likely local farmer-bred (non-commercial) seed,\nand moving to the use of commercial seed would increase costs considerably for these farmers. Seed networks and\nbanks protect local agrobiodiversity and landraces, which are important to facilitate adaptation, and can provide crucial\nlifelines when crop harvests fail (Louwaars 2002; Howard 2015; Coomes et al. 2015; Van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017;\nVasconcelos et al. 2013; Reisman 2017) (Table 6.28). Desertification and land degradation: There are no studies as-\nsessing global potential (Tables 6.36 and Table 6.44). Food security: Large benefits since local seeds increase the ability\nof farmers to revive and strengthen local food systems; several studies have reported more diverse and healthy food\nin areas with strong food sovereignty networks (Coomes et al. 2015; Bisht et al. 2018) (Table 6.52).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: There are no studies to assess the global mitigation potential of different Disaster Risk Management (DRM)\napproaches (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits due to widespread use of early warning systems that reach hundreds\nof millions (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012; Mahmud and Prowse 2012; Birkmann et al. 2015) (Table 6.28). Desertifi-\ncation and land degradation. There are no studies assessing the global potential (Tables 6.36 and Table 6.44). Food\nsecurity: Moderate benefits by helping farmers to harvest crops in advance of impending weather events, or otherwise\nto make agricultural decisions to prepare for adverse events (Fakhruddin et al. 2015; Genesio et al. 2011; Hillbruner\nand Moloney 2012) (Table 6.52).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Variable impacts &#8211; poor global coverage in the literature, though studies from the US suggest a small\nincrease in emissions from crop insurance and likely benefits from other risk-sharing instruments (Table 6.20).\nAdaptation: Moderate benefits by buffering and transferring weather risk, saving farmers the cost of crop losses.\nHowever, overly subsidised insurance can undermine the market&#8217;s role in pricing risks and thus depress more rapid\nadaptation strategies (Meze-Hausken et al. 2009; Skees and Collier 2012; Jaworski 2016) (Table 6.28). Desertification:\nThe impacts of risk-sharing globally have not been quantified (Table 6.36). Land degradation: Variable impacts as\nevidence suggests that subsidised insurance in particular can increase crop production in marginal lands, and reforming\nthis would lead to benefits (Table 6.44). Food security: Small to moderate benefits for food security, as risk-sharing\noften promotes food-supply sharing (Table 6.52).</td>
