In South Africa, 13.5% of young people are estimated to be overweight and obese (O/O) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The burden of O/O induces heat stress, as body fatness determines one&#8217;s heat tolerance level. In a humid environment, aerobically fit youth are more capable of tolerating core temperatures of 0.9&#160;&#176;C higher before yielding to heat exhaustion. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> highlights a cross-sectional study of 211 young people. As there is no available data for all genders, the table will be limited to only boys and girls. The survey found that whereas only 7.7% of boys were overweight, the same could not be said of girls as 21.1% were declared overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Also, while only 1.0% of boys were obese, 4.6% of girls were seen as falling in the same bracket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Percentage of South Africa&#8217;s youth estimated to be overweight and obese</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Gender</th><th align="left">% Overweight</th><th align="left">% Obese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Boys</td><td align="left">7.7</td><td align="left">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Girls</td><td align="left">21.1</td><td align="left">4.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
