This theme also focuses on suggested interventions to address community and global emergencies and emergency workforce approaches through community health approaches. Haines, Falceto de Barros, Berlin, Heymann, and Harris (2020) discussed the importance of community health workers in COVID&#8208;19 response. Their commentary proposed a large scale emergency program to engage community health workers for care of vulnerable populations in the UK based on the World Health Organization response and suggested that &#8220;young people in the range of 18&#8211;30&#160;years deemed at lower risk of acquiring serious consequences from the pandemic exposure should offer a coordinated community workforce in the pandemic&#8221; (p. 1,174). Armitage and Nellums (2020) focused on the importance of water in the era of climate change and COVID&#8208;19 and examined the importance of access to fresh water for regular handwashing during the pandemic. They further urged that fresh water be provided free of cost to engage populations in hygiene recommendations and to limit spread of COVID&#8208;19. As they suggested, access to water is inextricably linked with climate change and integrally related to limiting the spread of the current pandemic.</p>
