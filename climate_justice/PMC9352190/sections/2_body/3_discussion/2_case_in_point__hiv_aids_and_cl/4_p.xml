<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0022">Direct evidence of climate change's impacts on the HIV epidemic in the Philippines - whether by creating the conditions for increased transmission, disrupting access to care, or increasing susceptibility to other diseases - is still yet to be generated. Hence, the conceptual framework described above must guide future HIV/AIDS research, policy, and program design to ensure that future HIV/AIDS response in the country is climate-adaptive. The major first step is to ensure that future iterations of the Philippines&#8217; AIDS Medium Term Plan acknowledge climate change as a pressing threat to national progress towards ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, which is the goal articulated in the 2016 United Nations High Level Political Declaration [<xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Embedding climate considerations in national HIV/AIDS policy will greatly aid in setting the direction of activities of various stakeholders towards building climate resilience within the HIV/AIDS sector.</p>
