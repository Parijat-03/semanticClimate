<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Within scholarly debates on the Anthropocene, geoengineering is often portrayed as a hypermodern &#8216;technofix&#8217; raising serious ethicopolitical concerns (<xref rid="bibr29-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Szerszynski et al., 2013</xref>), namely, the expansion of capitalist &#8211; and extractivist &#8211; domination into new frontiers: the stratosphere, the oceans and space. Geoengineering can be understood as an attempt to control &#8216;earth systems in order to combat &#8211; or at least to reduce &#8211; the negative consequences of capitalist externalization&#8217; (<xref rid="bibr1-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Altvater, 2016</xref>: 151), instead of tackling the deep-rooted causes of the climate crisis, entwined with socioeconomic and political systems. Following this line of thought, <xref rid="bibr29-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Szerszynski et al. (2013)</xref> argue that geoengineering &#8211; and specifically SRM &#8211; is an inherently political technology, favouring certain social patterns and power relations, thus jeopardizing democracy. However, <xref rid="bibr16-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Heyward and Rayner (2015)</xref> suggest that social scientists are highly critical of geoengineering applications (such as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)) &#8216;at a much earlier stage than they have been of proposals for drastic emissions cuts in the mainstream climate-change discourse&#8217; (p. 102).</p>
