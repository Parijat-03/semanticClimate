Development has been China&#8217;s main domestic policy goal since the beginning of &#8216;reform and opening up&#8217; in the late 1970s. The country has been pursuing its two &#8216;centenary goals&#8217; of building a &#8216;moderately prosperous society&#8217; by 2020 (declared achieved by Xi at the July 2021 celebration of the Communist Party&#8217;s 100th anniversary) and building a &#8216;great modern socialist country&#8217; by the PRC&#8217;s 100th anniversary in 2049 (Nikkei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2021</xref>). Specific economic development objectives are defined in and implemented under successive 5-year plans at national and subnational levels. Within this framework, China for decades followed a material- and energy-intensive &#8216;traditional development model&#8217; (Yi and Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2006</xref>). This resulted in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> becoming by far the largest GHG emitter in absolute terms, with per capita emissions higher than those of the wealthier EU (BBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>).</p>
