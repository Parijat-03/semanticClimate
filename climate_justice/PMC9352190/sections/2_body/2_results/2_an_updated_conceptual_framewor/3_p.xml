As previously discussed, climate change does not directly influence the HIV virus, but the changes that it generates in environmental and social systems eventually impact the whole sequelae of the HIV/AIDS experience from viral transmission and acquisition to disease progression and mortality <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Finally, the role of the social determinants of health in both increasing climate vulnerability and worsening HIV/AIDS-related outcomes is emphasized. The health impacts of both climate change and HIV/AIDS are unevenly distributed in society, and such inequalities are driven by a wide array of social stratifiers such as gender, race, employment, and geographic location, among others <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These social determinants operate in the different pathways of the climate-HIV nexus as well as in the different levels. An integrated, multisectoral, and equity-focused approach is therefore critical to tackling HIV/AIDS in the climate era.</p>
