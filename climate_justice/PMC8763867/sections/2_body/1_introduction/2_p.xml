Community organizing is a leadership practice that aims to enable a constituency, typically one that lacks resources and power, to identify problems they share and solutions they desire and to take collective action to achieve those solutions.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Harvard Kennedy School professor Dr. Marshall Ganz has developed a framework used to teach community organizing in a variety of settings, including to health professionals.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A key element of this framework is public narrative,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> a storytelling process through which one develops values-based relationships with stakeholders.
