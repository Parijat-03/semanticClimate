<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Goymann (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) discussed the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and its intersection with climate change and the biodiversity crisis, thus fitting with Theme 3 on climate change and the environment; however Goymann's commentary also overlaps with Theme 2&#8212;<italic toggle="yes">Global Approach Addressing Human&#8208;Environmental Issues</italic>. The commentaries by Helm (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and Goymann (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) are two examples that offer key themes that also overlap with other themes.</p>
