More than 90% of private business chief executive officers, for instance, state that sustainability is important to their company&#8217;s success and working toward developing strategies to &#8220;fit&#8221; the sustainability trends. By contrast, the next phase of business sustainability, or what Hoffman refers to as &#8220;sustainable business 2.0&#8221; needs to be based on a model in which the private sector is leading the market transformation process toward greater sustainability. Even if one agrees with the premise that &#8220;changing the way we do business is essential to addressing the challenges of environmental degradation&#8221; (Hoffman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>, p. 35), it is not clear if the private sector has the capacity or even the desire leading the market transformation process toward greater sustainability.</p>
