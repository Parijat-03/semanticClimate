instances, comments described how models work (e.g. &#8220;Models are not static and
continually get refined with more data. Most models have assumptions. All models
have uncertainty&#8221;). In other instances, comments clarified the assumptions made
in the process of making predictions, one commenter elaborates:<disp-quote><p>Models don&#8217;t know the future outright &#8211; what people do matters and they
try to adjust to those changes. Think of it this way: the models that
predict deaths are going to decrease assume we will be
sheltering-in-place for longer, while models that predict the number of
deaths will increase assume shelter-in-place will be lifted. Models
extrapolate from trends&#8212;they don&#8217;t predict policy decisions.</p></disp-quote></p>
