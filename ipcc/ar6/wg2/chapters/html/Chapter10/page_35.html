The 2004 El Ni&#241;o caused the Philippines an 18% production loss during the dry season and a 32% production loss during the wet season (Cruz et&#160;al., 2017).

The economic contribution could be as high as 44% of the coastal communities&#8217; GDP as in the case of Sri Lanka (Sarathchandra et&#160;al., 2018). Five Asian countries (i.e., China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Japan) are in the top ten of global fish producers, representing a cumulative share of 36% in 2018 (FAO, 2020).

Asia has been impacted by SLR (Panpeng and Ahmad, 2017), a decrease in precipitation in some parts (Salik et&#160;al., 2015) and an increase in temperature (Vivekanandan et&#160;al., 2016), all of which have drastic effects on fisheries and aquaculture (FAO, 2018c). Its coastal fishing communities is exposed to disasters, which are predicted to increase (Esham et&#160;al., 2018). Fisheries in most of South Asia and Southeast Asia involve small-scale fishers who are more vulnerable to climate-change impacts compared with commercial fishers (S&#246;nke Kreft et&#160;al., 2016; Blasiak et&#160;al., 2017), although there is a general decreasing trend in the number of small units (Fernandez-Llamazares et&#160;al., 2015; ILO, 2015). A regional study of South Asia forecast large decreases in potential catch of two key commercial fish species (hilsa shad and Bombay duck) in the Bay of Bengal (Fernandes et&#160;al., 2016), which forms a major fishery and food source for coastal communities. About 69% of the commercially important species of the Indian </span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.04" top="714.65"><span x0="317.96" y0="714.65" x1="572.04" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 322.54; y0: 714.65; y1: 724.15; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">other anthropogenic factors (Dineshbabu et&#160;al., 2020). Likewise, water salinisation brought about by SLR is expected to impact the availability of freshwater fish in southwest coastal Bangladesh with adverse implications to poor communities (Dasgupta et&#160;al., 2017a). Analysis of fishery has indicated that there will be a continued decrease in catch impacting the seafood sector in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (Nong, 2019). Climate change is predicted to decrease total productive fisheries potential in South and Southeast Asia, driven by a temperature increase of approximately 2&#176;C by 2050 (Barange et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.04" top="582.67"><span x0="317.96" y0="582.67" x1="572.04" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 321.82; y0: 582.67; y1: 592.17; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Like fisheries, Asian aquaculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Shrimp farmers and fry catchers of Bangladesh are frequently affected by extreme climatic disruptions like cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture (Islam et&#160;al., 2016a; Kais and Islam, 2018). The majority of shrimp farmers also observed that weather has changed abruptly during the past 5&#160;years and that high temperature is most detrimental because it lowers growth rate, increases susceptibility to diseases, including deformation, and affects production (Islam et&#160;al., 2016a). Low production in shrimp farming is also attributed to variation and intensity of rainfall perceived by the majority of farmers as part of climate-change impacts (Ahmed and Diana, 2015; Islam et&#160;al., 2016a; Henriksson et&#160;al., 2019). In Vietnam, small-scale shrimp farmers are likewise vulnerable to climate change, although those who practise an extensive type of farming with low inputs are more vulnerable compared with those who practise a more intensive type with more capital investment (Quach et&#160;al., 2015; Quach et&#160;al., 2017). Seaweed farming in Asia is very popular, and the significance of seaweed aquaculture beds in capturing carbon is recognised, but most of the farmed seaweeds are susceptible to climate change (Chung et&#160;al., 2017a; Duarte et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.07" top="318.7"><span x0="317.96" y0="318.7" x1="572.07" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 325.35; y0: 318.7; y1: 328.2; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Marine heatwaves are a new threat to fisheries and aquaculture (Froehlich et&#160;al., 2018; Fr&#246;licher and Laufk&#246;tter, 2018) including disease spread (Oliver et&#160;al., 2017), live feed culture (copepods) (Doan et&#160;al., 2018) and farming of finfishes like Cobia (Le et&#160;al., 2020). Predicting MHWs is considered a prerequisite for increasing the preparedness of farmers (Fr&#246;licher and Laufk&#246;tter, 2018). In Southeast Asian countries more than 30% of aquaculture areas are predicted to become unsuitable for production by 2050&#8211;2070 and aquaculture production is predicted to decrease 10&#8211;20% by 2050&#8211;2070 due to climate change (Froehlich et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="415.86" top="186.72"><span style="x0: 317.96; x1: 322.52; y0: 186.72; y1: 196.22; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="317.96" y0="186.72" x1="415.86">10.4.5.2.2 Crop production</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.05" top="162.72"><span x0="317.96" y0="162.72" x1="572.05" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 322.17; y0: 162.72; y1: 172.22; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Since IPCC AR5, more studies have been done on different scales from local to global that focus on the differentiated projected impacts of climate change on the production and economics of various crops with rice, maize and wheat among the major crops receiving more attention. New research findings affirm that climate-change impacts, and will continue to significantly affect, crop production in diverse ways in particular areas all over Asia (Figure&#160;10.6). An increasing number of sub-regional and regional studies using various modelling tools provide significant evidence on the overall projected impacts of climate change on crop production at the sub-regional and regional </span></div></body></html>
