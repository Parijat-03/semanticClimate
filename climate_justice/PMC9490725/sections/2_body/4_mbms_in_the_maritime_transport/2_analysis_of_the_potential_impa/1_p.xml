(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>) summarised the flaws in both a regional EU ETS (industry opposition, risk of distorting the market, administrative burden, carbon leakage, negative example of aviation) and a global ETS (operational and administrative complexity, likelihood of offsetting rather than reducing emissions, and the unfair market impact of transaction costs on smaller shipping lines given that the six largest control half of the market). It is significant that the EU (and likely any global) ETS does not include methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a GHG gas 28&#8211;34 times more potent than CO<sub>2</sub> over 100&#160;years or over 85 times more powerful over 20&#160;years (Lindstad &amp; Rialland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). This omission is important because of the increased use of liquefied natural gas (cooled methane) as a shipping fuel as well as the potentially massive increase in the use of natural gas to produce hydrogen as an alternative fuel for global shipping. Release of methane throughout this process could be a large contributor to climate change that the ETS will do nothing to prevent.</p>
