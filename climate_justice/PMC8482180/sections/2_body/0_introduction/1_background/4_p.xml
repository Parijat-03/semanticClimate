<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite having the tools at our disposal to enable adequate food supply for all, inequities in income, food access and distribution, and most importantly, food sovereignty, worsen food insecurity [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The detrimental impact of climate change on food systems is further exacerbated by a lack of food sovereignty [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Failure of these systems is linked to a troubling decline in mental health [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and diet-related chronic disease (ie, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], particularly among Indigenous and racialized communities. These communities also face the brunt of climate change impacts and have the least control over their food access [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Solastalgia, which refers to the mental distress caused by environmental degradation and changes, is of increasing concern as environmental disasters and biodiversity loss have become more frequent and severe due to climate change [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Solastalgia may include ecological grief or eco-anxiety resulting from unanticipated ecological losses and uncertainty about the changing environment [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
