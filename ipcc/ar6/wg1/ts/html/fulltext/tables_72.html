      <td>Box TS.7, Figure 1 | Effects of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) on global surface temperature and air pollution across the WGI core set of\nShared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). The intent of this figure is to show the climate and air quality (surface ozone and particulate matter smaller than\n2.5 microns in diameter, or PM ) response to SLCFs in the SSP scenarios for the near and long-term. Effects of net aerosols, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons\n2.5\n(HFCs; with lifetimes less than 50 years), and methane (CH) are compared with those of total anthropogenic forcing for 2040 and 2100 relative to year 2019. The\n4\nglobal surface temperature changes are based on historical and future evolution of effective radiative forcing (ERF) as assessed in Chapter 7 of this Report. The\ntemperature responses to the ERFs are calculated with a common impulse response function (RT) for the climate response, consistent with the metric calculations in\nChapter 7 (Box 7.1). The RT has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.0&#176;C for a doubling of atmospheric CO concentration (feedback parameter of &#8211;1.31 W m&#8211;2 &#176;C&#8211;1).\n2\nThe scenario total (grey bar) includes all anthropogenic forcings (long- and short-lived climate forcers, and land-use changes). Uncertainties are 5&#8211;95% ranges. The\nglobal changes in air pollutant concentrations (ozone and PM ) are based on multimodel Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations and\n2.5\nrepresent changes in five-year mean surface continental concentrations for 2040 and 2098 relative to 2019. Uncertainty bars represent inter-model &#177;1 standard\ndeviation. {6.7.2, 6.7.3, Figure 6.24}</td>

      <td>Since AR5, further modelling work has been conducted on aerosol-based solar radiation modification (SRM) options\nsuch as stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning21 and their climate and\nbiogeochemical effects. These investigations have consistently shown that SRM could offset some of the effects of\nincreasing greenhouse gases on global and regional climate, including the carbon and water cycles (high confidence).\nHowever, there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scales and seasonal\ntime scales (high confidence), and large uncertainties associated with aerosol&#8211;cloud&#8211;radiation interactions persist.\nThe cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO sinks (medium confidence), but this\n2\nwould not stop CO from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued\n2\nanthropogenic emissions (high confidence). It is likely that abrupt water cycle changes will occur if SRM techniques\nare implemented rapidly. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO emissions scenario would cause\n2\nrapid climate change (high confidence). However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emissions reduction and\ncarbon dioxide removal (CDR) would avoid these termination effects (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.3. 6.4.6, 8.6.3}.</td>
