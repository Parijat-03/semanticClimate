Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> gives a description of state climate policy instruments, as identified by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, which emphasize some of the more comprehensive state climate policies to date.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>State climate policy innovations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Policy</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Low Carbon and Alternative Fuel Standards</td><td align="left">Requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum amount of renewable fuels, such as cellulosic biofuel</td></tr><tr><td align="left">State GHG Emissions Targets</td><td align="left">Requires the state to reduce GHG emissions by a specified amount at a specific date</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Carbon Cap and Trade</td><td align="left">A program that sets a cap on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and creates a marketplace for buying and selling credits</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Renewable Portfolio or Clean Energy Standards (RPS/CES)</td><td align="left">Requires a specified percentage of a state&#8217;s electricity to be sourced from renewable energy by a specified date</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Decoupling</td><td align="left">Power regulation adjustments that sever the link between energy sold and revenue</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Climate Action Plans</td><td align="left">A strategic plan that provides a blueprint for climate mitigation and adaptation in the state</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Source: Center for Climate and Energy Solutions</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
