So, the global warming effect can be expected by the designed analysis. However, there is a limitation in the international prospect, because there are many uncertainties in each nation to apply the electricity-mix. Therefore, international corporations are important to keep the integrity of global warming by inducing the temperature of nature. Following the pandemic situation, the leverage of carbon neutrality could be happened without intentional treatment of carbon emissions decreasing.</p>
