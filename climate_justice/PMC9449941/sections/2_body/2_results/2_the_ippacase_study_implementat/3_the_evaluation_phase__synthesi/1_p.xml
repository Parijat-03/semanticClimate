We developed a three-step approach for the evaluation of the impact assessment. First, we set up evaluation criteria according to different aspects of socio-technical systems and adapted them to the case of urban passenger transport. Second, we identified results from the impact studies assigning them to the criteria. Third, we evaluated qualitatively the single policy package measures according to the evaluation criteria.</p>
