<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There have been increasing calls to change the intellectual climate in scientific research and policy circles in order to reset our perspective on the causes, conditions and consequences of climate change, and the requirements and possibilities of addressing it effectively (Castree et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gills &amp; Morgan, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Nightingale et al., <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). We locate our argument within these emerging critical voices. While &#8216;land politics&#8217; is a narrow theme, it nevertheless acts as a lynchpin in the actual world of agriculture and food, so that the essence of our argument has broader resonance. On the one hand, agriculture contributes <italic toggle="yes">at least</italic> 30% of the world&#8217;s total greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, significant elements within mitigation and adaptation ideas and practice are related to land and nature &#8211; as productive inputs for carbon-saving or carbon-neutral commodity production systems and as a sink for waste (Fraser, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Martinez-Alier, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; O&#8217;Connor, <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Ultimately, a huge part of the global complex of responses to climate change is linked to agriculture and food (Borras et al., <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), and thus inherently to land.</p>
