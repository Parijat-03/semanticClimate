Warren et al. (2018) estimate that about 50% of insects, which are often pests or disease vectors, will change ranges by about 50% by 2100 under current GHG emissions trajectories. These changes will lead to crop losses due to changes in insect pests (Deutsch et al. 2018) and weed pressure (Ziska et al. 2018), and thus affect pest and disease management at the farm level (Waryszak et al. 2018).

Pollinator-dependent crops contribute up to 35% of global crop production volume and are important contributors to healthy human diets and nutrition (IPBES 2016). On a&#160;global basis, some 1500 crops require pollination (typically by insects, birds and bats) (Klein et al. 2007). Their importance to nutritional security is therefore perhaps under-rated by valuation methodologies, which, nonetheless, include estimates of the global value of pollination services at over 225&#160;billion USD2010 (Hanley et al. 2015). As with other ecosystem processes affected by climate change (e.g.,&#160;changes in pests and diseases), how complex systems respond is highly context dependent.

Disruption can occur through changes in species&#8217; ranges or by changes in timing of growth stages (Settele et al. 2016). For example, if plant development responds to different cues (e.g.,&#160;day length) from insects (e.g.,&#160;temperature), the emergence of insects may not match the &#64258;owering times of the plants, causing a&#160;reduction in pollination. Climate change will affect pollinator ranges depending on species, life-history, dispersal ability and location. Warren et al. (2018) estimate that under a&#160;3.2&#176;C warming scenario, the existing range of about 49% of insects will be reduced by half by 2100, suggesting either signi&#64257;cant range changes (if dispersal occurs) or extinctions (if it does not). However, in principle, ecosystem changes caused by invasions, in some cases, could compensate for the decoupling generated between native pollinators and pollinated species (Schweiger et al. 2010).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="531.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 531.58; y1: 541.08; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="531.58" x1="571.76">Other impacts include changes in distribution and virulence of pathogens affecting pollinators, such as the fungus </span><span style="x0: 511.93; x1: 517.75; y0: 519.58; y1: 529.08; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="511.93" y0="519.58" x1="567.65">Nosema cerana</span><span style="x0: 567.56; x1: 569.84; y0: 519.58; y1: 529.08; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="567.56" y0="519.58" x1="571.77">, which can develop at a&#160;higher temperature range than the less-virulent </span><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 495.59; y1: 505.09; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.72" y0="495.59" x1="368.5">Nosema apis</span><span style="x0: 368.41; x1: 370.69; y0: 495.59; y1: 505.09; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="368.41" y0="495.59" x1="571.74">; increased mortality of pollinators due to higher frequency of extreme weather events; food shortage for pollinators due to reduction of &#64258;owering length and intensity; and aggravation of other threats, such as habitat loss and fragmentation (Gonz&#225;lez-Varo et al. 2013; Goulson et al. 2015; Le Conte and Navajas 2008; Menzel et al. 2006; Walther et al. 2009; IPBES, 2016).
