These foundational insights are clearly centred on the environmental ceiling that binds us all and these were reflected in the participants&#8217; understandings of the interconnectedness of losses. Biodiversity, and the services that this diversity enables, is paramount and any losses will have cascading effects. To borrow the term &#8216;risk multiplier&#8217;, and with the knowledge that climate change increases risk multipliers for conflict and also disaster loss (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>), we argue that losses in themselves can be loss risk multipliers insofar as a loss can create risk for future losses.</p>
