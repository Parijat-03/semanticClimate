Adopting the LMDI approach, Shahiduzzaman and Alam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>) decomposed the energy intensity in Australia over the period 1978&#8211;2009. The impacts of three identifiers on energy intensity were considered, namely, energy efficiency, fuel mix, and structure effect, in accordance with the sector-level and sub-sector level. The authors reported that energy efficiency and the structure effect were the two factors that reduced Australia's energy intensity in the reviewed period.</p>
