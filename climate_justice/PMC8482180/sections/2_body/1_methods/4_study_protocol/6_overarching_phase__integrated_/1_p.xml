<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The success of this platform will depend on the overarching phase of integrated knowledge translation that integrates the Smart Framework [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] with Traditional Knowledge to ensure Two-Eyed Seeing [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] in the project conceptualization, development, implementation, evaluation, and refinement. The Smart Platform combines citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science to conduct population health intervention research in the digital age [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. By integrating this approach of the framework with the Traditional Knowledge of Indigenous communities, we are working to decolonize how big data and artificial intelligence are used in advancing equity. Integrated knowledge translation ultimately promotes community input for climate adaptation strategies at every phase and is critical for vertical (to larger communities) and horizontal (increasing platform features) scale-up.</p>
