<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our multivariable analysis of the NDVI in September yielded results that were similar to those observed in May, with two exceptions. The proportions of children and agricultural workers indicated a non-significant association with the NDVI in May, but both these variables showed a significantly positive relationship with the NDVI in September. For these two vulnerable groups, our findings thus suggest higher protection from heat exposure via greenspace in September, but no significant protection from heat exposure in the hotter or pre-monsoon month of May.</p>
