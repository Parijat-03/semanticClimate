Water requirements in Delhi are 927 million gallons per day (MGD). The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) supplies 815 MGD (including around 100 MGD from groundwater). The deficit in drinking water supply is 112 MGD. The coverage of water supply was 71.6 percent of the population (Service Level Benchmarking Data book, 2010). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.04" top="649.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="649.23" x1="526.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Availability of both ground and surface water sources in Delhi are also fast depleting. Depth to groundwater in Delhi varies from 1.2 meters (in the Yamuna flood plain) to more than 64 meters (in the southern part of the Delhi ridge). Groundwater levels in Delhi are declining with an average rate of decline as high as ten feet per year (south and south west Delhi) (Delhi Jal Board, 2010). Surface water comprises 86 percent of the drinking water in Delhi. The primary source of surface water is the River Yamuna along with other Himalayan rivers through several interstate arrangements and sub-surface sources of water (Delhi CDP, 2010). As temperatures rise, demand for water in Delhi will increase. This along with increased population will lead to depletion of reservoirs of water sources and increased economic and environmental costs of transporting water from sources at a greater distance from Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.32" top="478.44"><span x0="72.02" y0="478.44" x1="526.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 478.44; y1: 490.44; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Increased intensity of rainfall may increase water run-off, which would lead to reduced infiltration and spring recharge (Delhi Jal Board, 2010). Shortage of power may also impede water supply in Delhi. Shortage in supply of water in Delhi is further complicated with leakage of 40 percent reported by Delhi Jal Board. On average, Delhi&#8217;s households have access to tap water for only 13.5 hours a day (Service Level Benchmarking Data book, 2010). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.12" top="387.1"><span x0="72.02" y0="387.1" x1="526.12" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 387.1; y1: 399.1; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Groundwater in Delhi was found to contain high amounts of nitrates and fluorides in addition to heavy metals in a recent study performed by NEERI. Increase in intensity of the monsoon may lead to increased runoff and therefore a reduction in water quality supplied in Delhi. Parts of the city are also susceptible to flash floods in periods of high intensity rainfall. This problem is compounded by low coverage of water treatment infrastructure and poor drainage facilities in most parts of Delhi. Water treatment plants currently in operation in Delhi are also severely affected during floods, which may lead to low water supply due to extreme deterioration in water quality and subsequent reduction in operational capacity of these plants. In addition, freshwater lines, which often run close to drains, are affected by &#8220;siphon effect&#8221; (intake of wastewater into freshwater system) due to low water pressure. This deterioration in water quality can also lead to an increase in spread of water borne diseases like Cholera (Kraus, 2009).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="125.42" top="184.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="184.63" x1="125.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 184.63; y1: 196.63; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity</span><span x0="125.42" y0="184.63" x1="526.08" style="x0: 125.42; x1: 128.76; y0: 184.63; y1: 196.63; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: Delhi&#8217;s large slum population would be particularly affected by decreasing water availability because of limited access to basic services.  Other areas of Delhi dependent solely on supply of groundwater are susceptible to declining groundwater levels throughout the city. Socio-economically backward areas of Delhi would be most affected by the shortage of water as they may not have enough water for basic daily domestic needs. The agricultural sector in Delhi would be severely affected as water scarcity may lead to a reduction in productivity and loss of livelihood. Dependence of water supply on power supply also complicates the issue of water scarcity in Delhi. Kraus, et al. 2009 has shown that informal settlements in Delhi are </span></div></body></html>
