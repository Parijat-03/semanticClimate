Some trends do emerge. Comparing a minimization of effort from the 2018 ESR to the alternative of maximal equity-compatible emissions, we find the ESR-based negotiation points exhibit much more clustering (as point size indicates frequency), most agreement points are either almost fully capability-weighted, or roughly 50% capability, and the rest either equality or (to a lesser extent) responsibility interpretations. As one of our four capability interpretations is based heavily on the 2018 ESR (and a second based purely on GDP per capita is highly correlated; see &#8220;Methods&#8221;), the clustering near a 100% capability allocation is not surprising. However, even when minimizing aggregate EU Member State deviation from maximum equity-compatible emissions, a similar clustering occurs, although less strongly. Regardless of the minimization criteria or equity interpretation, what is consistent is the presence of capability in practically all negotiation points; the only equity criteria to do so. The negotiation points seem to explain the current EU negotiations, as these results would make it seem unsurprising that the 2021 proposal emphasizes a GDP per capita-based allocation (and thus, the capability dimension). This analysis thus has identified why a capability principle interpretation based on GD/capita ranks so prominently within the EU negotiation process.</p>
