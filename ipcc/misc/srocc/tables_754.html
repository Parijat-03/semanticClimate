      <td>(Cerutti et al. 2015). In general, traditional biomass use is associated with poverty. Therefore, efforts to reduce the dependence\non fuelwood use are to be conducted in coherence with poverty alleviation (McCollum et al. 2018; Joana Specht et al. 2015b;\nZulu and Richardson 2013b). The substantial potential co-benefits suggest that the traditional biomass sector remains under-\nresearched and under-exploited in terms of cost-effective emissions reductions, as well as for synergies between climate stabilisation\ngoals and other SDGs.</td>
