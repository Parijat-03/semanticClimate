![[fig2_15.png]]Figure 2.15 Total annual CO2 emissions for 116 countries by global region based on consumption and production-based emissions 

The shaded areas are the net CO2 trade balances (differences) between each of the regions. Yellow shading indicates that the region is a net importer of embodied CO2 emissions, leading to consumption-based emission estimates that are higher than traditional territorial emission estimates. Blue shading indicates the reverse. Production-based emissions are collected from EDGAR and consumption-based emissions from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).
