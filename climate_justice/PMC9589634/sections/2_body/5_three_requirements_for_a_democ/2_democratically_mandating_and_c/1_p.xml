Moreover, they tend to enjoy considerable support in public opinion (Bertsou and Caramani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>), which is most likely due to the fact that experts are expected to be &#8216;disinterested&#8217;, i.e., to have no own stakes in the decision at hand and seek to maximise a common good. To give these bodies a legitimate role in decision-making, however, institutional design needs to be democratized. In other words: the set-up, mandating and design of an expert body must itself be the result of an inclusive and democratic decision-making process. Such democratic institutional design processes should be meta-deliberative: they should be based on deliberation about who should deliberate and decide how and when.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref></p>
