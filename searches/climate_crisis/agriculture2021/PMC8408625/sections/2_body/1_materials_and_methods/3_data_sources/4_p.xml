<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0085">WNV case data were provided on request by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu" id="intr0005">http://www.ecdc.europa.eu</ext-link>). Case data are collected weekly by EU member states and affiliates. Positive cases were confirmed by at least one of the following techniques: (1) isolating WNV or WNV nucleic acid from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (2) inducing a WNV-specific antibody response (either IgG/IgM) in a serological test. We should also bear in mind that the actual number of cases in Europe is likely to be much higher than reported, since most people infected with WNV will not develop symptoms (are asymptomatic). Around 20% of those infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever, a flu like illness, or severe West Nile disease <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. All cases were aggregated yearly to create the annual panel data-set.</p>
