In context of climate change, the term &#8216;deep uncertainty&#8217; is frequently used to denote situations in which either the analysis of a&#160;situation is inconclusive, or parties to a&#160;decision cannot agree on a&#160;number of criteria that would help to rank model results in terms of likelihood (e.g.,&#160;Hallegatte and Mach 2016; Maier et al.&#160;2016) (Sections&#160;7.1 and&#160;7.5, and Table&#160;SM.1.2 in Supplementary Material). However, existing uncertainty does not support societal and political inaction.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.95" top="387.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 387.54; y1: 397.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="387.54" x1="307.95">The many ways of dealing with uncertainty in decision-making can be summarised by two decision approaches: (economic) cost-bene&#64257;t analysis, and the precautionary approach. A&#160;typical variant of cost-bene&#64257;t analysis is the minimisation of negative consequences. This approach needs reliable probability estimates (Gleckler et al.&#160;2016; Parker 2013) and tends to focus on the short term. The precautionary approach does not take account of probability estimates (cf. Raffensperger and Tickner 1999), but instead focuses on avoiding the worst outcome (Gardiner 2006).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.92" top="267.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 267.55; y1: 277.05; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="267.55" x1="307.92">Between these two extremes, various decision approaches seek to address uncertainties in a&#160;more re&#64258;ective manner that avoids the limitations of cost-bene&#64257;t analysis and the precautionary approach. Climate-informed decision analysis combines various approaches to explore options and the vulnerabilities and sensitivities of certain decisions. Such an approach includes stakeholder involvement (e.g.,&#160;elicitation methods), and can be combined with, for example, analysis of climate or land-use change modelling (Hallegatte and Rentschler 2015; Luedeling and Shepherd 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.96" top="147.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 147.56; y1: 157.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="147.56" x1="307.96">Flexibility is facilitated by political decisions that are not set in stone and can change over time (Walker et al.&#160;2013; Hallegatte and Rentschler 2015). Generally, within the research community that investigates deep uncertainty, a&#160;paradigm is emerging that requires the development of a&#160;strategic vision of the long&#160;&#8211; or mid-term future, while committing to short-term actions and establishing a&#160;framework to guide future actions, including revisions and &#64258;exible adjustment of decisions (Haasnoot 2013) (Section&#160;7.5).</span></div><div left="317.67" right="555.99" top="543.01"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 323.91; y0: 543.01; y1: 555.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.67" y0="543.01" x1="555.99">1.3 Response options to the key challenges</span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.1" top="519.52"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 323.12; y0: 519.52; y1: 529.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="519.52" x1="566.1">A number of response options underpin solutions to the challenges arising from GHG emissions from land, and the loss of productivity arising from degradation and deserti&#64257;cation. These options are discussed in Sections&#160;2.5 and&#160;6.2 and rely on (i) land management, (ii) value chain management, and (iii) risk management (Table&#160;1.2). None of these response options are mutually exclusive, and it is their combination in a&#160;regionally, context-speci&#64257;c manner that is most likely to achieve co-bene&#64257;ts between climate change mitigation, adaptation and other environmental challenges in a&#160;cost-effective way (Griscom et al.&#160;2017; Kok et al.&#160;2018). Sustainable solutions affecting both demand and supply are expected to yield most co-bene&#64257;ts if these rely not only on the carbon footprint, but are extended to other vital ecosystems such as water, nutrients and biodiversity footprints (van Noordwijk and Brussaard 2014; Cremasch 2016). As an entry point to the discussion in Chapter&#160;6, we introduce here a&#160;selected number of examples that cut across climate change mitigation, food security, deserti&#64257;cation, and degradation issues, including potential trade-offs and co-bene&#64257;ts.</span></div><div left="73.7" right="178.19" top="723.73"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.27; y0: 723.73; y1: 732.23; width: 4.56; font-size: 8.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="73.7" y0="723.73" x1="178.19">Cross-Chapter Box 1 (continued)</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.95" top="699.52"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="699.52" x1="551.95">There is a small, but growing literature on quantitative pathways to achieve normative visions and their associated trade-offs (IPBES 2018a). Whilst the visions themselves may be clearly articulated, the societal choices, behaviours and transitions needed to attain them, are not. Better accounting for human behaviour and decision-making processes in global scale land-use models would improve the capacity to quantify pathways to sustainable futures (Rounsevell et al.&#160;2014; Arneth et al.&#160;2014; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018). It&#160;is, however, dif&#64257;cult to understand and represent human behaviour and social interaction processes at global scales. Decision-making in global models is commonly represented through economic processes (Arneth et al.&#160;2014). Other important human processes for land systems including equity, fairness, land tenure and the role of institutions and governance, receive less attention, and this limits the use of global models to quantify transformative pathways, adaptation and mitigation (Arneth et al.&#160;2014; Rounsevell et al.&#160;2014; Wang et al.&#160;2016). No model exists at present to represent complex human behaviours at the global scale, although the need has been highlighted (Rounsevell et al.&#160;2014; Arneth et al.&#160;2014; Robinson et al.&#160;2017; Brown&#160;et al.&#160;2017; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018).</span></div></body></html>
