The rationale was explained in the 2015 IISD/State Council report on &#8216;Greening China&#8217;s Financial System&#8217;: while green credit was an appropriate tool for the &#8216;&#8220;catching up&#8221; stage&#8217; of China&#8217;s development, further progress at technological frontiers and involving novel business models can be beyond the expertise of banks to assess. Therefore, greening the full range of financial products could &#8216;provide a greater diversity of perspectives from institutional investors, intermediaries and risk investors to evaluate green projects, as well as strengthen risk pricing and expand the financial service supply&#8217; (IISD/State Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>, 9). Moreover, as PBoC Research Bureau chief economist Ma Jun explained, the green credit policy mostly entailed &#8216;restrictive measures&#8217;, while positive incentives were missing (PBoC/UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>, xii).</p>
