Luke Howard first describe the UHI in 1820. Over the years, numerous studies (Qian et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Zhou &amp; Shepherd,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) have discussed why heat islands exist: prevalence of heat&#8208;absorbing materials in cities, lack of cooling associated with vegetation, and additional waste heat associated human activities such as transportation and heating&#8208;cooling systems. Though the UHI is often referenced as a singular entity, there are actually multiple heat islands. Johnson and Shepherd&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) summarized three types of heat islands: surface or skin (paved surfaces), canopy (the 2&#8208;m air Temperature), and boundary layer (roughly lowest 1&#160;km of the atmosphere). Ferguson and Woodbury&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) have described a subsurface heat island. Zahn et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) have even proposed the hydrological UHI. For broader context, Qian et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) offers a comprehensive assessment of urbanization, extreme weather, and climate.</p>
