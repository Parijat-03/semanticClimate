Responses consisted mainly of agriculture and livestock kits which helped Afghan residents in guaranteeing their upcoming meals as well as empowering the rural workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Alongside these reinforcements, multiple precautions were taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus including the closure of public areas.
