group on the social production of habitat. This group encompasses a great diversity
of theoretical approaches, from those rooted in a Marxist perspective that
ultimately seek to restore the social function of land and housing, to feminist and
decolonial perspectives rooted in the assumption that theory, knowledge and practice
are constantly re-made through activism and resistance. In this sense, the Coalition
has acted over the years as a resonance chamber, enabling member organizations to
exchange and mature their practices in critical dialogue with others.<sup>(<xref rid="fn4-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">4</xref>)</sup> In a similar vein,
HIC-AL&#8217;s involvement with the schools is expressed in several ways, from providing
inputs into their pedagogies, concepts and content, to nurturing and expanding their
regional networking capacity. Since 2003, HIC-AL has also hosted a working group on
capacity-strengthening which has spearheaded the consolidation of various pedagogic
experiences from its members and articulated some of them into formal education
programmes (including the Diploma Course in Participatory Design, one of the
experiences analysed in this paper).</p>
