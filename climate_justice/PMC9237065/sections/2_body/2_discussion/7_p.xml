The most obvious example is the question of when to start taking historical emissions into account; we choose 1995 based on publication of the IPCC&#8217;s Second Assessment Report. However, valid arguments can be made that other, particular earlier, years should be chosen. We find that while that is the case, shifting the year has less of an effect on outcomes compared to the initial choice to consider countries&#8217; historical responsibility. Overall emissions reductions for countries are mostly unaffected or would see only minimal changes (see Supplementary Information, section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for further detail).</p>
