Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the resulting country emissions reduction burden for the twelve interpretations presented. The figure makes readily apparent the 2021 approach of the EU to allocate 2030 budgets using a GDP per capita-based allocation with some adjustments, as shown by the consistent proximity of our capability considerations to the proposed levels, barring a few outlier countries (e.g., Ireland and Luxembourg, with per capita GDP levels two to three times higher than the EU average). Beyond this, we are able to arrange the countries into three distinct groups; the first where the (majority of) equity-based allocations suggest a less&#160;stringent target than that proposed by the European Commission (EC), a second where no clear trend exists (results are above and below the EC proposal), and a third where equity-based allocations lead to a more&#160;stringent target. For clarity, we have organized these countries according to this trend, in panels A, B, and C.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Possible country emission reduction targets by 2030 (relative to 2005) reflecting an EU-27 overall 55% reduction target (relative to 1990) for an application of each single principle (and under different interpretations of them).</title><p>The dashed line indicates the target reduction put forward in the &#8216;Fit for 55%&#8217; proposal.
