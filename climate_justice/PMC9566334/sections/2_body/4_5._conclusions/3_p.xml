<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Residential segregation was shown to be a statistically significant factor in explaining variability in inter-city SUHI intensity. Higher levels of segregation corresponded to higher SUHI intensity measurements after accounting for climate zone, population density, and spatial and temporal random effects. A 0.11 increase in the <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> index corresponds with an increase in average SUHI intensity by 0.42 K. Future studies could examine other ways of measuring residential segregation or could similarly look at finer-scale segregation in cities such as census tract-level measurements. One could use the block group-level variables identified here to calculate <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> by census tract. Analysis could then determine if this relationship between <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> and SUHI intensity sustains at this scale.</p>
