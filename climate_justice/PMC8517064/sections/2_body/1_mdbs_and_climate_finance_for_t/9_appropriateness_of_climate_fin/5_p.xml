Risk and incentives to try new and untested approaches are important as well. Millan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>) focusses specifically on the issue of financing adaptation in the context of food system transformation and identified high investment risk and lack of primary data/information asymmetries and unproven and early-stage business models with long development lead times as a leading cause of core market failures incentivize private sector investment into adaptation. Experience from the IFAD ASAP program indicates that grant financing provided a key incentive for adoption of the program activities overcoming reluctances linked to the unknown and untested effectiveness of the adaptation actions and their potential effects on development outcomes. The importance of grant financing to test new approaches is borne out by the experience of some countries which had ASAP grants subsequently using loan funding to scale adaptation activities including Bolivia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Gambia and Cambodia. These governments have recognized the benefit of certain adaptation activities through a trial and error process and now, despite not being grant-supported, are willing to borrow money in order to achieve similar results (IFAD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>).</p>
