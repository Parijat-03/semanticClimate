These groups contact union members by mail and email and hire paid staff to visit workers on the job and at home, all to inform them about <italic>Janus</italic> and convince them to drop their union membership (Patrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). The organizations have used phone calls and billboards, along with Facebook and television ads, to tell employees that they need not pay union dues (Kamenetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>).
