Public participation in politics refers to the direct involvement of citizens in decision-making processes rather than indirect involvement via voting (Schudson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1999</xref>). Since the 1960&#8217;s, social movements and government reforms institutionalized participation in low-income neighborhoods, a feature that in the last 20&#160;years has become central to the logic of governing cities under the rubric of &#8220;public governance&#8221; (Baiocchi &amp; Ganuza, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>). In the early 2000s, as scholars lamented the decline of civic participation (e.g. see Putnam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2000</xref>), this new movement posited that expanding participation could be a source of democratic renewal, social solidarity, and decisions that the public would perceive as more legitimate. The goal of local participation is to produce democratic outcomes and empower citizens through incorporation of their unique knowledge into decision-making. The upshot of research from participation advocates is that direct involvement of citizens in decision-making can bolster procedural justice and, in practical terms, can reduce social and political resistance that could emerge if the government or another actor imposed a plan without public input.</p>
