<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The need for the regulations to embrace a broader spectrum of global public health threats is most evident in the context of small island developing states. WHO recognises &#8220;the severe and urgent threats to the health and well-being&#8221; of 65 million people living in these states, and its draft plan of action presents &#8220;a vision that by 2030, all health systems in small island developing states will be resilient to climate variability and change.&#8221;<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> WHO&#8217;s vision will provide small comfort to those ministers of health who are, literally, watching their homelands sink beneath the waves. As the Marshall Islands&#8217; ambassador to the United Nations, Doreen Debrun asked: &#8220;Can you imagine having won an independent state only to realise that your children might see it disappear?&#8221;<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> How resilient will the health systems of states such as the Marshall Islands have to be to cope with a rise in sea level of several metres &#8220;within a few centuries&#8221;? <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In such circumstances, we argue that declaring a public health emergency of international concern could be appropriate.</p>
