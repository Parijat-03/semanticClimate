<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Continental Chile is located on the southwestern coast of South America, extending from 17&#176; S to 56&#176; S between the Andes Mountain range and the Pacific Ocean. Administratively, Chile is divided into 16 regions and 346 communes. This study used data from 188 communes based on their availability: 6 communes from the northern macrozone (Regions XV, I, II, III, IV); 113 from the central zone (Regions V, XIII, VI, VII); and 69 from the southern zone (Regions XVI, VIII, IX, X, XIV, XI, XII). This study was an ecological design as our units of analysis were defined geographically rather than by individuals, comparing COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate among Chilean communes in 2020.</p>
