Specifically, why do tribal nations vary in translating wind energy potential into wind installed capacity? The Seneca Nation&#8217;s installation of a wind turbine in western New York illustrates a success story. After receiving three grants from the Department of Energy&#8217;s Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs (in 2003, 2007, and 2014), Seneca Nation installed a 1.7-megawatt wind turbine that significantly increased the availability of electricity and decreased cost for some of its members [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Yet, scholars have also noted the &#8220;paradox of plenty&#8221; where tribal nations with rich potential for renewables have not exploited these resources due to cultural and sovereignty issues [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and legal obstacles [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Take the case of the Crow Tribe, which has made significant efforts in the pursuit of wind power development, but challenges of land status and securing outside investors have obstructed the realization of those objectives [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
