If this illusion was able to be sustained by Coleman in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>, a decade later it cannot be. The corporate-dominated internet has proven libertarians wrong: atomised &#8220;heroic&#8221; individuals cannot find self-actualisation in the face of such over-whelming institutional power. Individual liberalism is impossible in an age of such incredible institutional power. The &#8220;hidden affordances&#8221; of the sub-systems most internet users spend the majority of their time in online (as opposed to the delusion of the internet as a &#8220;sandbox&#8221;) may be malleable to a literate few, but this presents the prospect of meritocracy heavily tilted by neoliberal access to education, not a sustainable democracy of equality. Further, social media may provide greater affordances for reactionary and counter-democratic agents (the entrenched, corporations, the state) to limit movement and political agency (Cammaerts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>; Uldam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>).</p>
