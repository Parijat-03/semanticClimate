      <td>&#8226; The SSPs can be combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) which imply different levels of mitigation,\nwith implications for adaptation. Therefore, SSPs can be consistent with different levels of global mean surface\ntemperature rise as projected by different SSP-RCP combinations. However, some SSP-RCP combinations are not possible;\nfor instance RCP2.6 and lower levels of future global mean surface temperature rise (e.g., 1.5&#186;C) are not possible in SSP3\nin modelled pathways. {1.2.2, 6.1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}</td>
