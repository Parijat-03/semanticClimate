In areas where vulnerability to climate change is heightened, increased exposure to climate change variables and impacts is likely to exacerbate current inequalities in the societies concerned, penalising further already disadvantaged groups such as migrant &#64257;shers (e.g.,&#160;Lake Chad) or women (e.g.,&#160;employees in Chile&#8217;s processing industry) (FAO 2014a).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="579.54" x1="307.6">In many countries the projected declines co-occur across both marine &#64257;sheries and agricultural crops (Blanchard et al. 2017), both of which will impact the aquaculture and livestock sectors (Supplementary Material Figure SM5.1).

Farm households in the developing world often rely on a&#160;complex mix of crops, livestock, aquaculture, and non-agricultural activities for their livelihoods (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015; Antle et al. 2015). Across the world, smallholder farmers are considered to be disproportionately vulnerable to climate change because changes in temperature, rainfall and the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events directly affect their crop and animal productivity as well as their household&#8217;s food security, income and well-being (Vignola et al. 2015; Harvey et al. 2014b). For example, smallholder farmers in the Philippines, whose survival and livelihood largely depend on the environment, constantly face risks and bear the impacts of the changing climate (Peria et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="267.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 267.54; y1: 277.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="267.54" x1="307.58">Smallholder farming systems have been recognised as highly vulnerable to climate change (Morton, 2007) because they are highly dependent on agriculture and livestock for their livelihood (</span><span style="x0: 289.43; x1: 294.01; y0: 243.55; y1: 253.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="289.43" y0="243.55" x1="307.54">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 98.41; x1: 101.05; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="98.41" y0="231.55" x1="307.59">) (Dasgupta et al. 2014). In Zimbabwe, farmers were found vulnerable due to their marginal location, low levels of technology, and lack of other essential farming resources. Farmers observed high frequency and severity of drought; excessive precipitation; drying of rivers, dams and wells; and changes in timing and pattern of seasons as evidence of climate change, and indicated that prolonged wet, hot, and dry weather conditions resulted in crop damage, death of livestock, soil erosion, bush &#64257;res, poor plant germination, pests, lower incomes, and deterioration of infrastructure (Mutekwa 2009). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="111.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 111.56; y1: 121.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="111.56" x1="307.59">In Madagascar, Harvey et al.

In Lesotho, a&#160;study on subsistence farming found that food crops were the most vulnerable to weather, followed by soil and livestock. Climate variables of major concern were hail, drought and dry spells which reduced crop yields. In the Peruvian Altiplano, Sietz et al. (2012) evaluated smallholders&#8217; vulnerability to weather extremes with regard to food security and found that resource scarcity (livestock, land area), diversi&#64257;cation of activities (lack of alternative income, education deprivation) and income restrictions (harvest failure risk) shaped the vulnerability of smallholders.

Regional economic models of farming systems can be used to examine the potential for switching to other crops and livestock, as well as the role that non-farm income can play in adaptation (Valdivia et al. 2015 Antle et al. 2015). On the other hand, lost income for smallholders from climate change-related declines (for example, in coffee production), can decrease their food security (Hannah et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="435.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.1; y0: 435.6; y1: 445.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="435.6" x1="566.1">Farming system methods developed by AgMIP (Rosenzweig et al. 2013) have been used in regional integrated assessments in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kihara et al. 2015), West Africa (Adiku et al. 2015); East Africa (Rao et al. 2015), South Africa (Beletse et al. 2015), Zimbabwe (Masikati et al. 2015), South Asia (McDermid et al. 2015), Pakistan (Ahmad et al. 2015), the Indo-Gangetic Basin (Subash et al. 2015), Tamil Nadu (Ponnusamy et al. 2015) and Sri Lanka (Zubair et al. 2015). The assessments found that climate change adds pressure to smallholder farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with winners and losers within each area studied. Temperatures are expected to increase in all locations, and rainfall decreases are projected for the western portion of West Africa and southern Africa, while increases in rainfall are projected for eastern West Africa and all studied regions of South Asia.
