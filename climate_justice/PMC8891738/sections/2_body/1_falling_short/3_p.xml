Under its umbrella, the US-led initiative, Power Africa, brought together more than 160 private sector partners onboard to accelerate clean energy access for sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, in a surprising announcement, USA and China pledged to boost their climate cooperation over the next decade, committing towards a transition to clean energy and decarbonization in their joint declaration. Finally, and in order to put pressure and move faster, the Glasgow Climate Pact asked countries to propose emissions-cutting targets by next year (2022) at COP27, rather than in the traditional 5 year bracket.</p>
