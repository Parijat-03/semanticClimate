Extension could help implement and shape the Civilian Conservation Corps established by President Biden&#8217;s executive order that aims to create well-paying jobs in conservation, reforestation, remediation, and infrastructure, such as a decentralized electrical grid for renewable energy, constructing zero carbon homes, and weatherization. Liberation Extension could teach about environmental justice, the political economy of fossil fuels, and the kinds of economic, energy, agricultural, housing, and transportation systems necessary to avoid the worst outcomes, while promoting organizing to demand a far reaching climate transition complete with well-paying jobs for workers in polluting industries. A full treatment of Liberation Extension&#8217;s potential for climate change mitigation and ecological restoration is beyond the scope of this essay, but it could play an important role in promoting post-growth economic common sense and creating movements for decarbonization.</p>
