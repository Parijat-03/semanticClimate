They also play a&#160;pivotal role in managing household finances and investing their savings in education, health, livelihoods, and other activities that assist their families to adapt and respond to climate effects (Aipira et al. 2017). Decreasing women&#8217;s capacity to adapt to the impacts of&#160;climate&#160;change also decreases that of the household (Bryan and Behrman 2013). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="293.4" top="591.12"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.15; y0: 591.12; y1: 600.62; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="591.12" x1="293.4">However, gender norms and power inequalities also shape the ability of men, women, boys, girls and the elderly to adapt to climate risks (Rossi and Lambrou 2008). For example, women pastoralists in the Samburu district of Kenya cannot make decisions affecting their lives, limiting their adaptive capacity (Ongoro and Ogara 2012).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="293.41" top="507.13"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.27; y0: 507.13; y1: 516.63; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="507.13" x1="293.41">Participation in decision-making and politics, division of labour, resource access and control, and knowledge and skills (Nelson and Stathers 2009) are some of the barriers to adaptation. Women&#8217;s adaptive capacity is also diminished because their work often goes unrecognised (Rao 2005; Nelson and Stathers 2009). Many of women&#8217;s activities are not defined as &#8216;economically active employment&#8217; in national accounts (FAO 2011a). This non-economic status of women&#8217;s activities implies that they are not included in&#160;wider discussions of priorities or interventions for climate change. Their perspectives and needs are not met; and thus, interventions, information, technologies, and tools promoted are potentially not relevant, and even can increase discrimination (Alston 2009; Edvardsson Bj&#246;rnberg and Hansson 2013; Huynh and Resurreccion 2014). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="293.42" top="315.15"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 81.26; y0: 315.15; y1: 324.65; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="315.15" x1="293.42">Where gender-sensitive policies to climate change may exist, effective implementation in practice of gender equality and empowerment may not be achieved on the ground due to lack of technical capacity, financial resources and evaluation criteria,&#160;as&#160;shown in the Pacific Islands (Aipira et al. 2017). Thus, corresponding institutional frameworks that are well-resourced, coordinated, and informed are required, along with adequate technical capacity within government agencies, NGOs and project&#160;teams, to strengthen collaboration and promote knowledge sharing (Aipira et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="292.84" top="171.17"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 81.61; y0: 171.17; y1: 180.67; width: 7.91; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="171.17" x1="292.84">Women&#8217;s empowerment: Synergies among adaptation, </span></div><div left="73.7" right="189.0" top="147.17"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 81.09; y0: 147.17; y1: 156.67; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="147.17" x1="189.0">mitigation, and food security</span><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.1; y0: 135.18; y1: 144.68; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="135.18" x1="293.43">Empowering and valuing women in their societies increases their capacity to improve food security under climate change and&#160;make&#160;substantial contributions to their own well-being, to that of their families and of their communities (Langer et al. 2015; Ajani&#160;et al. 2013 and Alston 2014) (</span><span style="x0: 228.82; x1: 233.4; y0: 87.18; y1: 96.68; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="228.82" y0="87.18" x1="286.55">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 286.55; x1: 289.19; y0: 87.18; y1: 96.68; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="286.55" y0="87.18" x1="293.4">).

In Nepal, women&#8217;s empowerment had beneficial outcomes in maternal and children nutrition, reducing the negative effect of low production diversity (Malapit et al. 2015). Integrated nutrition and agricultural programmes have increased women&#8217;s decision-making power and control over home gardens in Burkina Faso (van&#160;den Bold et al. 2015) with positive impacts on food security. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="473.9" top="446.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 446.98; y1: 456.98; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="446.98" x1="473.9">1.1.4 Food systems in AR5, SR15, and&#160;the&#160;Paris&#160;Agreement </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="411.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.09; y0: 411.11; y1: 420.61; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="411.11" x1="566.07">Food, and its relationship to the environment and climate change, has grown in prominence since the Rio Declaration in 1992, where food production is Chapter&#160;14 of Agenda 21, to the Paris Agreement of 2015, which includes the need to ensure food security under the threat of climate change on its first page.
