One of the main limitations of previous static 4 global and regional information (including the AR5 Atlas) was the limited options available in order to be 5 informative for different regions and applications. For instance, the use of standard seasons limits the 6 assessment in many cases, such as regions affected by monsoons or seasonal rainband migrations or other 7 phenomena driven seasons. The limited number of variables which can be treated on a printed Atlas also 8 prevents the inclusion of relevant indices and climate impact drivers. One of the main general concerns 9 raised by this online alternative was the potential danger of having an unmanageable number of final 10 products impossible to assess following the IPCC assessment process. All the recommendations and 11 concerns have been taken into account in the design of the Interactive Atlas, implementing a tool for flexible 12 regional and temporal analysis, but with limited predefined functionality and granularity. Moreover, links 13 have been established with other chapters (e.g. using common tools) in order to support their assessment and 14 adopt their methodological recommendations.  15 16 In order to facilitate the assessment of the Interactive Atlas, it has been implemented tracking relevant 17 navigation information in the URL, so any product visualized by the Interactive Atlas (as characterized by 18 the particular dataset, region, variable, season, scenario, future and baseline periods, and analysis tool) can 19 be reproduced using the review code provided by the Interactive Atlas for the particular page viewed. This 20 serves as a sort of ID which facilitates the review process of the granular products shown by the Interactive 21 Atlas. 22 23 24 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 468.17; y1: 479.15; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="468.17" x1="423.48">Atlas.7.2 Description of the Interactive Atlas: functionalities and datasets  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="468.17" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 468.17; y1: 479.15; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">25 26 The Interactive Atlas builds on the work done in the framework Spanish National Adaptation Plan (PNACC 27 &#8211; AdapteCCa; http://escenarios.adaptecca.es) to develop a regional scenarios portal to assist the Spanish 28 climate change impact and adaptation community.
