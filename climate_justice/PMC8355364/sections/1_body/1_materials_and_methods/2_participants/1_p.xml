We formed counter horizons in the sample based on the type of initiative work; we distinguished between educational work and political work for climate justice, a distinction that is in line with the difference postulated by <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Bamberg (2014)</xref> between the intention to bring about individual behavioral change and the goal to bring about structural, sociopolitical, or institutional change. Using this criterion, we then selected several students actively engaged in climate justice work who fell into either both types of initiative work or only one of the two. Four people from different climate justice initiatives were interviewed in December 2020 (all personal data were pseudonymized): L. was a Master&#8217;s student in the first semester of the Global Change Management program; A. was a Master&#8217;s student in the first semester of the Agribusiness program; E. was studying English and politics for a teaching degree; and D. was studying law in the third semester.</p>
