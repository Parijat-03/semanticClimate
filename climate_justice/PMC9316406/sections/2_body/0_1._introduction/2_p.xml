<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Over the two-year academic period of 2020&#8211;2022, Canada experienced horrific disasters (e.g., COVID-19, floods, and mass shootings). This multi-disaster societal context has encouraged the first author to engage GSW in social work curriculum and professional training, forging two types of professional relationships with the second author, namely an instructor&#8211;student interplay (in-class education, 2020&#8211;2021) and a supervisor&#8211;trainee relationship (research-based field education, 2021&#8211;2022). Throughout this two-year interaction, the two authors frequently applied the critical reflection approach, which is an essential pedagogical instrument in health and social care disciplines [<xref rid="B5-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], to integrate GSW components into the social work teaching-training process, with particular attention to compounded influences of extreme events on individual and collective health and well-being at different levels. These critical reflections, as well as third-party feedback (e.g., students&#8217; evaluation, peer review, and presentation feedback) during this two-year period, form the foundation for this article to identify the essential components in developing GSW-specific interventions. </p>
