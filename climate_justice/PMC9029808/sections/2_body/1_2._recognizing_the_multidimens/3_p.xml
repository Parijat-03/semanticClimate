Low-income countries, whose economies are more agriculturally dependent, and already marginalized groups, face the highest climate vulnerability, further exacerbating global social injustice [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To exemplify, compared to adults, children have higher chances of experiencing malnutrition, which already affects one in three children worldwide, linked to climate-induced water and food shortage [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Estimates show that the number of deaths of children under five caused by undernutrition could increase by 1 million by 2030 due to climate change [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indigenous people and children, who often live on low-elevation deltas, are more susceptible to facing high sea level rise and flooding, and are seeing their cultural relationship to nature severely threatened by deforestation and land degradation [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
