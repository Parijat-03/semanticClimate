For further ice concentration reductions, the temperature response gets slightly 2 smaller (0.48&#176;C per 1% ice concentration reduction). 3 4 Overland et al. (2014) highlighted the difference between the near-term &#8216;adaptation timescale&#8217; and the long-5 term &#8216;mitigation timescale&#8217; for the Arctic (60&#8211;90&#176;N). Only in the latter half of the century do the projections 6 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions noticeably separate. End-of-the-century warming is approximately 7 twice as large under RCP8.5 demonstrating the impact of the lower emissions under RCP4.5 (AMAP, 2017). 8 More specifically under the strong forcing scenario, annual mean surface air temperatures in the Arctic (70&#8211;9 90&#176;N) is projected to increase by 8.5 &#177; 2.1&#176;C (model-mean value and inter-model standard deviation) over 10 the course of the 21st century (Bintanja and Andry, 2017). Koenigk et al. (2015) show that the end-of-the-11 century warming (2080&#8211;2099 period relative to 1890&#8211;1999 period) can exceed 15&#176;C in autumn and winter 12 over the Arctic Ocean. 13 14 Projections averaged over the four best-performing CMIP5 models over the Arctic are for annual mean 15 surface air temperature to warm 4.1&#176;C, 5.7&#176;C, and 10.6&#176;C by 2100 compared to the 1951&#8211;1980 period under 16 RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively (Hao et al., 2018). The largest annual warming is simulated over 17 the Arctic Ocean with CMIP5 ensemble median projections for Svalbard of about 10&#176;C for RCP8.5 and 7&#176;C 18 (van der Bilt et al., 2019). Projected temperatures show strongest increase over northern Fennoscandia and 19 the high Arctic, exceeding 7&#176;C by end of the 21st century for a typical &#8216;warm winter&#8217; under RCP4.5, and 20 much stronger warming under RCP8.5 with increases exceeding 18&#176;C in some places (Benestad et al., 2016).  21 22 The ensemble of CMIP6 (15-17 models depending on the scenario) shows generally greater warming 23 compared to CMIP5 (Figure Atlas.48:). There is weak agreement among the models in projected temperature 24 change over the Arctic North Atlantic under SSPs until the mid-century (Figure Atlas.48:), but a robust 25 warming signal clearly emerges even there by 2100. Generally, the largest annual warming is simulated over 26 the Arctic Ocean, particularly over the Barents Sea (Figure Atlas.48:). 27 28 Future warming in CORDEX RCMs and the CMIP5 models are similar. Koenigk et al. (2015) show that the 29 RCM warming over the Arctic Ocean is smaller, while the warming over land is larger in winter and spring 30 but smaller in summer, compared with CMIP5.  31 32 The CMIP5 multi-model mean projected precipitation increase in the Arctic is in the order of 50% under 33 RCP8.5 by the end of 21st century, which is among the highest globally (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Over 34 70&#8211;90&#176;N, the precipitation increase is 61.9 &#177; 20.5% and 56.4 &#177; 13.2% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. 35 In the near future (2030 to 2049), this corresponds to an increase of 2&#8211;10 mm per month and substantially 36 more for the Barents Sea (up to 50 mm per month) under RCP8.5, and the increase is expected to continue 37 until the end of the century (Koenigk et al., 2015). For ARCO (Svalbard), van der Bilt et al. (2019) estimate 38 the increase in annual precipitation by 2100 to be about 65% for RCP8.5 and 45% for RCP4.5 (CMIP5 39 ensemble median). However importantly, the simulated Arctic (70&#8211;90&#176;N) precipitation increase varies by a 40 factor of three to four between models (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). The projected increase is strongest in late 41 autumn and winter. 42 43 The CMIP6 projections confirm precipitation will </span><span style="x0: 279.12; x1: 282.17; y0: 228.89; y1: 239.87; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="279.12" y0="228.89" x1="305.63">likely </span><span x0="305.64" y0="228.89" x1="41.45" style="x0: 305.64; x1: 308.69; y0: 228.89; y1: 239.87; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">increase almost everywhere in the Arctic (Figure 44 Atlas.48:). The largest increase is simulated over the Barents Sea and Chukchi Sea regions, and over 45 northeast Greenland. A pronounced uncertainty in the projection exists over the Arctic North Atlantic and 46 south Greenland. There, the precipitation signal is not significant even by the end of the 21st century and 47 under strong scenarios (RCP8.5, SSP5-8.5). According to the generally higher warming in CMIP6, compared 48 to CMIP5, the projected precipitation increase is higher in CMIP6. 49 50 The increase in Arctic mean annual-average precipitation sensitivity has been estimated at 4.5% per 1&#176;C 51 temperature rise, compared to a global average of 1.6&#8211;1.9% per 1&#176;C temperature rise (Bintanja and Selten, 52 2014) based on a set of 37 CMIP5 GCMs. Koenigk et al. (2015) stress the different precipitation sensitivity 53 in winter (0.8 mm per month per 1&#176;C temperature rise) and summer (2 mm per month per 1&#176;C temperature 54 rise), based on RCM downscaling of four CMIP5 models.
