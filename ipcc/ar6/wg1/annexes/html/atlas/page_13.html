They can provide further insight compared to using the subcontinental 4 reference regions, for example being relevant for model evaluation purposes and to developing climate 5 information relevant to the AR6 WGII and III reports.  6 7 As an illustrative example, CORDEX simulation results are validated for the Southeast Asia region (treated 8 as a single AR6 WGI reference region) and for the subregions shown in Figure Atlas.6: (Cruz and Sasaki, 9 2017; Juneng et al., 2016; Ngo-Duc et al., 2017). These subregions are based on the historical behaviour of 10 rainfall identified by previous studies of the Southeast Asia region. For example, there are two subregions 11 over the Philippines, based on two dominant climate types strongly influenced by the synoptic-scale 12 southwest and northeast monsoon systems (Manzanas et al., 2015). Over Vietnam, there is a north-south 13 division of subregions as rainfall is highest in the north during summer but peaks in the south in winter. 14 More information about the climatic subregions in Southeast Asia can be found in Juneng et al. (2016).  15 16 17 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 556.67; y1: 567.65; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="556.67" x1="210.41">[START Figure Atlas.6: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="556.67" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 556.67; y1: 567.65; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18 19 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 532.64; y1: 542.66; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="532.64" x1="123.38">Figure Atlas.6: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="532.64" x1="517.53" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 134.3; y0: 532.64; y1: 542.66; width: 6.68; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">CORDEX-SEA subregions based on historical rainfall climatology and variability (Juneng et al., </span><span x0="27.66" y0="532.43" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 532.43; y1: 543.41; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">20 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="521.12" x1="155.98" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.63; y0: 521.12; y1: 531.14; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">2016). </span><span x0="27.66" y0="520.91" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 520.91; y1: 531.89; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">21 22 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 495.77; y1: 506.75; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="495.77" x1="196.91">[END Figure Atlas.6: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="495.77" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 495.77; y1: 506.75; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23 24 25 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.62; y0: 457.79; y1: 468.77; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="457.79" x1="358.66">Atlas.3 Combining multiple sources of information for regions </span><span x0="27.66" y0="457.79" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 457.79; y1: 468.77; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">26 27 This section introduces the observational data sources and reanalyses that are used in the assessment of 28 regional climate change and for evaluating and bias adjusting the results of models (more information on 29 observational reference datasets in Annex I). Also, it introduces the different global and regional climate 30 model output that are used for regional climate assessment considering both historical and future climate 31 projections (see Annex III). Many of these models are run as part of coordinated Model Intercomparison 32 Projects (MIPs), including the global Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6) and the 33 COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX), which are also described below. Combining 34 information from these multiple data sources is a significant challenge (see Chapter 10 for an in-depth 35 treatment of the problem) though if clear messages on regional climate change can be generated then they 36 can be used to guide policy and support decisions responding to these changes. An important and necessary 37 part of this process is to check for consistency amongst the data sources which is discussed in the final 38 section.  39 40 41 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 254.45; y1: 265.43; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="254.45" x1="168.35">Atlas.3.1 Observations </span><span x0="27.66" y0="254.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 254.45; y1: 265.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">42 43 There are various sources of observational information available with disparity, inadequacy and 44 contradictions in these as well as applications of observations being assessed in Chapter 10. Observational 45 uncertainty is a key factor when assessing and attributing historical trends, so assessment should build on 46 integrated analysis from different datasets. The Atlas can supplement and complement Chapter 10 by 47 providing the opportunity to visualise and expand on its assessment. This includes displaying maps of 48 density of stations observations (including those that are used in the different datasets) and assessing 49 observational uncertainty by using multiple datasets and applying the concept of model (observational 50 references in this case) agreement. 51 52 Two of the most commonly used variables in climate studies are gridded monthly surface air temperature 53 and precipitation. There are many datasets available, commonly used ones including the Climatic Research 54 Unit CRU TS4.0 (version 4.03 used here; Harris et al., 2014), the Berkeley surface temperature dataset 55 </span></div></body></html>
