For other sectors, dedicated methods and guidance are still under development. Importantly, companies in the emission-intensive oil and gas sector and the forest, land, and agriculture sector can commit to setting SBTs but must wait for sector-specific guidance in order to submit targets for validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
