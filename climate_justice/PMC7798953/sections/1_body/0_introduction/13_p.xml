For instance, the 1918&#8211;1919 influenza pandemic is an obvious precedent to today's pandemic, but that connection proved challenging for Anna N. Dhody at the M&#252;tter Museum, Peter Liebhold at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History (<sc>Nmah</sc>), and Amanda L. Mahoney at the Dittrick Museum of Medical History, as their institutions, despite having been founded in the nineteenth century, have few holdings on the earlier pandemic. The omissions reflect collecting patterns that prioritized the white male elite; doctors determined what would be collected, and most were off at war. But the flu was battled largely in the home, with care provided by the invisible ranks of family, nurses, neighbors, and volunteers. These archival silences are loud for participants in all three of our discussions. They consider here the challenges of documenting the experiences of those who provide the bulk of care today&#8212;the heavily immigrant, often-undocumented, and largely female home health aides, nursing home workers, and nurses&#8212;the laboring bodies along our food supply chains, as well as the refugee communities that the <sc>Nmah</sc> curator Sam Vong has worked with, who create networks of care out of necessity and outside health care systems and the state. He asks: Are museums doing enough? Are they the correct institutions to help in some way other than sharing stories?</p>
