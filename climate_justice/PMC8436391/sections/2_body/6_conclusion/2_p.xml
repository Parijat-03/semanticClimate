<p>Our paper draws on critical themes (governance, a changing climate, technology and a global
pandemic) and our own pedagogy to advance conversations about community development teaching and
learning in the contemporary context. We revisit core principles&#8212;critical, relational and
connected&#8212;that underpin our pedagogies and facilitate us to attune social work education
to this challenging practice context. Our examples from the classroom discussed in the paper
bring to light a critical pedagogy that engages students in analysis and reflection. However,
this is not purely an intellectual exercise, it is a pedagogy that seeks to forge practice
understandings and deeply consider what actions are possible in constrained times.</p>
