Arguably, there should be a&#160;clear physical reason for the improvement, which is applicable to the evaluation of added value in downscaled projections (Giorgi et&#160;al., 2016). The added value depends on the region, season, and governing physical processes (Lenz et&#160;al., 2017; Schaaf and Feser, 2018). Thus, added value of downscaling global model simulations is most likely where regional- and local-scale processes play an important role in a&#160;region&#8217;s climate, for example in complex or heterogeneous terrain such as mountains (Lee and Hong, 2014; Prein et&#160;al., 2016b), urban areas (Arg&#252;eso et&#160;al., 2014), along coastlines (Feser et&#160;al., 2011; Herrmann et&#160;al., 2011; Bozkurt et&#160;al., 2019), or where convective processes are important (Prein et&#160;al.,&#160;2015). Examples of model improvements and added value are given in the following subsections and the Atlas.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="534.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="534.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A first step in determining added value in downscaling is to analyse whether the downscaling procedure gives detail on spatial or temporal scales not well-resolved by a&#160;global model, thus potentially representing climatic features missing in the GCM. This added detail, referred to as potential added value (PAV; Di Luca et&#160;al., 2012), is insufficient for demonstrating added value in downscaling (Takayabu et&#160;al., 2016), but lack of PAV indicates that the downscaling method lacks usefulness. Added value is not guaranteed simply by producing model output at finer resolution. It depends on several factors, such as the simulation setup and the specific climatic variables analysed (Di Luca et&#160;al., 2012; Hong and Kanamitsu, 2014; Xue et&#160;al., 2014). A&#160;variety of performance measures are needed to assess added value (Section&#160;10.3.3.1; Di Luca et&#160;al., 2016; Wilks, 2016; Ivanov et&#160;al., 2017, 2018; Soares and Cardoso, 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="354.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="354.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A further challenge, especially at increasingly higher resolutions, is that adequate observational data may not be available to assess added value (Section&#160;10.2, e.g.,&#160;Di Luca et&#160;al., 2016; Zittis et&#160;al., 2017; Bozkurt et&#160;al., 2019). This implies a&#160;need for additional efforts to obtain, catalogue and quality-control higher resolution observational (or observation-based) datasets (Thorne et&#160;al., 2017; Section&#160;10.2). Univariate demonstration of added value is necessary, but may be insufficient, as better agreement with observations in the downscaled variable may be a&#160;consequence of compensating errors that are not guaranteed to compensate similarly as climate changes. Multivariate analysis of added value is better able to demonstrate physical consistency between observed and simulated behaviour (Prein et&#160;al., 2013a; Meredith et&#160;al., 2015a; Reboita et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="285.35" top="186.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="186.48" x1="285.35" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 186.48; y1: 196.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.3.3 Performance at Simulating Large-scale Phenomena and Teleconnections Relevant for Regional Climate</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="150.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="150.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.67; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional climate is often controlled by large-scale weather phenomena, modes of variability and teleconnections (e.g.,&#160;Sections&#160;2.3 and 2.4, Annex IV). In particular, extreme events are often caused by specific, in some cases persistent, circulation patterns (Sections 11.3&#8211;11.7). It is therefore important for climate models to reasonably represent not only continental, but also regional climate and its variability for such extremes. As explained in Section&#160;3.3.3, standard resolution global models can suffer biases in the location, occurrence frequency or intensity of large-scale phenomena, such that statements about </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.33" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.33" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 311.9; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(Hall, 2014). RCMs have difficulties improving especially large-scale circulation biases, although some successful examples exist. But due to their enhanced representation of complex topography and coastlines, RCMs may add value to simulating the regional expression of teleconnections. Bias adjustment cannot mitigate fundamental misrepresentations of the large-scale atmospheric circulation (Maraun et&#160;al., 2017, Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.2). This subsection illustrates the relevance of large-scale circulation biases for regional climate assessments with selected examples from the mid- to high latitudes and tropics.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="510.18" top="582.6"><span style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.82; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="309.26" y0="582.6" x1="510.18">10.3.3.3.1 Mid- to high-latitude atmospheric variability phenomena:&#160;Blocking and extratropical cyclones</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="546.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="546.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 316.65; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Major large-scale meteorological phenomena for mid- to high latitude mean and extreme climate include atmospheric blocking and extratropical cyclones (Section&#160;2.3.1.4). Atmospheric blocking&#160;is characterized by a&#160;quasi-stationary, long-lasting, high-pressure system that blocks and diverts the movement of synoptic cyclones (Woollings et&#160;al., 2018). In regions where blocking occurs, it is known to lead to cold conditions in winter and warmth and drought during summer, defining the seasonal regional climate in certain years (Sousa et&#160;al., 2017, 2018b). Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that propagate preferentially in confined storm-track regions, characterized by large eddy kinetic energy, heat and momentum transports that shape regional weather at mid- to high latitudes (Shaw et&#160;al., 2016). Given their importance in shaping mean and extreme regional climate (Sections 3.3.3.3, 11.3 and 11.4), an accurate representation of blocking and extratropical cyclones in global and regional climate models is needed to better understand regional climate variability and extremes as well as to project future changes (Section&#160;11.7.2; Grotjahn et&#160;al., 2016; Mitchell et&#160;al., 2017; Rohrer et&#160;al., 2018; Huguenin et&#160;al., 2020). An overview of CMIP5 and CMIP6 model performance in simulating blocking and extratropical cyclones is given in Section&#160;3.3.3.3. CMIP6 models still suffer from long-standing blocking biases identified in previous generations of models. However, blocking location has improved compared to CMIP5, while comparable performance is seen for blocking frequency and persistence (Figure&#160;10.7). Increasing horizontal model resolution to about 20 km in the HighResMIP experiments improves the representation of blocking frequency and its spatial pattern in most models, but no clear effect could be shown for blocking persistence. Biases associated with these two phenomena are highly region- and season-dependent and their amplitudes vary among CMIP models (Drouard and Woollings, 2018; Schaller et&#160;al., 2018; Woollings et&#160;al., 2018; Harvey et&#160;al., 2020; Schiemann et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="150.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="150.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.19; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">RCMs have a&#160;very limited ability to reduce large-scale circulation errors of the driving GCM (Hall, 2014). In a&#160;study of five ERA-Interim-driven RCMs, Jury et&#160;al. (2018) showed that RCMs typically simulate fewer blocking events over Europe than are present in the driving data, irrespective of the RCM horizontal resolution. Based on a&#160;simple blocking bias-decomposition method, they suggest that blocking frequency biases can contribute to the RCM mean surface biases. Over some large domains, reanalysis-driven RCMs can significantly improve the representation of storm characteristics compared to the </span></div></body></html>
