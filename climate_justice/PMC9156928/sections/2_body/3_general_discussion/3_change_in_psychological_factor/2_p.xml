The intervention also boosted affective engagement, collective efficacy (Study 1), and identity (Study 2). Only four of the 11 factors changed in either study, suggesting that changes this size in these four factors alone were not sufficient to trigger action. Re-designing the videos might help to boost all 11 factors. Future research could employ a professional videographer, create content that is more local to the participants and use forms of narrative structure, perhaps by involving actors. Or, additional factors might need to be discovered and targeted. It remains possible that large increases in the 11 factors might not be sufficient to trigger action when participants do not have the time or financial resources to volunteer for activism.</p>
