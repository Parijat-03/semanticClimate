The programme has a strong human rights focus with students trained to identify and highlight the social justice dimensions of the subject matter of their presentations. Three virtual workshops on interactive teaching were delivered to prepare 30 students (selected from more than 90 applicants) for their involvement in the programme. The shift to virtual delivery of the workshops&#8212;via Zoom&#8212;was managed in ways that kept the interactivity and highlighted the importance of focusing on presenting in ways that work for your audience. With schools moving to online learning, opportunities have presented for Monash Street Law<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn64">64</xref> volunteers to develop and deliver community legal education presentations for schools.</p>
