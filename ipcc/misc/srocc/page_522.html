These are being developed by big and medium-sized cities in the world, often integrated within climate change policies (Moragues et al. 2013 and Calori and Magarini 2015). A&#160;review of 100 cities shows that urban food consumption is one of the largest sources of urban material &#64258;ows, urban carbon footprint, and land footprint (Goldstein et al. 2017). Additionally, the urban poor have limited capacity to adapt to climate-related impacts, which place their food security at risk under climate change (Dubbeling and de Zeeuw 2011).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="175.75" top="531.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.33; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 5.8; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="531.55" x1="175.75">Urban and peri-urban areas. </span><span style="x0: 176.56; x1: 178.86; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="176.56" y0="531.55" x1="307.94">In 2010, around 14% of the global population was nourished by food grown in urban and peri-urban areas (Kriewald et al. 2019). A&#160;review study on Sub-Saharan Africa shows that urban and peri-urban agriculture contributes to climate change adaptation and mitigation (Lwasa et al. 2014, 2015). Urban and peri-urban agriculture reduces the food carbon footprint by avoiding long distance food transport. These types of agriculture also limit GHG emissions by recycling organic waste and wastewater that would otherwise release methane from land&#64257;lls and dumping sites (Lwasa et al. 2014). Urban and peri-urban agriculture also contribute in adapting to climate change, including extreme events, by reducing the urban heat island effect, increasing water in&#64257;ltration and slowing down run-offs to prevent &#64258;ooding, etc. (Lwasa et al. 2014, 2015; Kumar et al. 2017a). For example, a&#160;scenario analysis shows that urban gardens reduce the surface temperature up to 10&#176;C in comparison to the temperature without vegetation (Tsilini et al. 2015). Urban agriculture can also improve biodiversity and strengthen associated ecosystem services (Lin et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.96" top="303.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.15; y0: 303.57; y1: 313.07; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="303.57" x1="307.96">Urban and peri-urban agriculture is exposed to climate risks and urban growth that may undermine its long-term potential to address urban food security (Padgham et al. 2015). Therefore, there is a&#160;need to better understand the impact of urban sprawl on peri-urban agriculture; the contribution of urban and peri-urban agriculture to food self-suf&#64257;ciency of cities; the risks posed by pollutants from urban areas to agriculture and vice-versa; the global and regional extent of urban agriculture; and the role that urban agriculture could play in climate resilience and abating malnutrition (Mok et al. 2014; Hamilton et al. 2014). Globally, urban sprawl is projected to consume&#160;1.8&#8211;2.4% and&#160;5% of the current cultivated land by 2030 and 2050 respectively, leading to crop calorie loss of&#160;3&#8211;4% and&#160;6&#8211;7%, respectively (Pradhan et al. 2014 and Bren&#160;d&#8217;Amour et al. 2017). Kriewald et al. 2019 shows that the urban growth has the largest impact in many sub-continental regions (e.g.,&#160;Western, Central, and Eastern Africa), while climate change will mostly reduce potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Southern Europe and North Africa.</span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.12" top="735.6"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 319.97; y0: 735.6; y1: 745.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="735.6" x1="566.12">In summary, urban and peri-urban agriculture can contribute to improving urban food security, reducing GHG emissions, and adapting to climate change impacts </span><span style="x0: 414.38; x1: 417.02; y0: 711.6; y1: 721.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="414.38" y0="711.6" x1="552.76">(robust evidence, medium agreement).</span></div><div left="317.67" right="544.86" top="675.42"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 322.87; y0: 675.42; y1: 685.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.67" y0="675.42" x1="544.86">1.6.6 Links to the Sustainable Development Goals </span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.09" top="651.52"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 319.97; y0: 651.52; y1: 661.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="651.52" x1="566.09">In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement were two global major international policies adopted by all countries to guide the world to overall sustainability, within the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and UNFCCC processes respectively.

(2017) and the International Council for Science (ICSU) (2017), but has trade-offs with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG&#160;15 (Life on Land) under current development paradigms (Pradhan et al. 2017). Sustainable transformation of traditional consumption and production approaches can overcome these trade-offs based on several innovative methods (Shove et al. 2012). For example, sustainable intensi&#64257;cation and reduction of food waste can minimise the observed negative relations between SDG 2&#160;and other goals (Obersteiner et al. 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;6 in Chapter 5&#160;and Section&#160;5.5.2). Achieving target 12.3 of SDG 12 &#8216;by 2030, to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses&#8217; will contribute to climate change mitigation.</span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.11" top="231.57"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 323.12; y0: 231.57; y1: 241.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="231.57" x1="566.11">Doubling productivity of smallholder farmers and halving food loss and waste by 2030 are targets of SDG 2&#160;and SDG 12, respectively (United Nations Statistics Division 2016). Agroforestry that promotes biodiversity and sustainable land management also contributes to food security (Montagnini and Metzel 2017). Land restoration and protection (SDG 15) can increase crop productivity (SDG&#160;2) (Wolff et al. 2018). Similarly, ef&#64257;cient irrigation practices can reduce water demand for agriculture that could improve the health of the freshwater ecosystem (SDG 6&#160;and SDG 15) without reducing food production (J&#228;germeyr et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.07" top="99.58"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 322.77; y0: 99.58; y1: 109.08; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.67" y0="99.58" x1="566.07">Climate action (SDG 13) shows negative relations (trade-offs) with most goals and is antagonistic to the 2030 development agenda under the current development paradigm (Figure&#160;5.16) (Lusseau and Mancini 2019 and Pradhan 2019).
