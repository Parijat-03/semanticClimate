<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par35">The point is that macro-level normativity is integrated into moral awareness and individual conduct on the micro-level: By &#8220;a direct action of God&#8221; and by means of the often mentioned &#8220;dialogue [&#8230;] with God himself&#8221; (Enc., 81) individuals are said to make &#8220;the leap towards the transcendent which gives ecological ethics its deepest meaning&#8221; (Enc., 210). The envisioned effect of this normative dynamics is to &#8220;develop a different lifestyle and bring about significant changes in society&#8221; (Enc., 208), i.e., on the meso-level. The micro-level moral awareness that brings about change on the meso-level correlates with ethical &#8220;responsibility&#8221; and not with its reduction to techno-scientific &#8220;accountability&#8221;. The strong emphasis on individuality in this dynamic process implies, however, a decentralized structure of the Encyclical&#8217;s normative scheme; every individual is understood as freely responding to a universal (macro-level) normative call.</p>
