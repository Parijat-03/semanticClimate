<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One absolutely paramount factor, I think, is that you're transparent, that you don't haul things into a museum and make them invisible. We worked hard to put them online so people could see them. I don't think, when you're asking people for objects, that they're likely to donate what is important. Sometimes they do. But being a curator is a skill. It's a black art to find folks who were in the right place at the right time and can tell good stories. It's also an iterative approach where you meet people and you engage in conversation. It's rarely a one-time visit. You develop a relationship that yields objects and then moves onto other objects where you develop a story. It is involved. It requires a commitment to an end goal.</p>
