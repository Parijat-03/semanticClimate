In 1998, Bradburne suggested that science centres must undergo a dramatic transformation if they are to remain relevant and thrive. He cautioned about the demise of the science museum and argued (rightly) that science centres uncritically continue to be planned around clusters of hands-on displays about scientific principles and phenomena, and when public institutions try to put science and technology into its social context, the society, paradoxically, is left out. Janes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>) through his suggestive book, entitled <italic>Museums in a troubled world: Renewal, irrelevance or collapse</italic>?, moves us to keep questioning the purpose of these institutions particularly in current times, when so many difficult socio-scientific issues need to be considered and discussed in order to enact social and environmental transformation. Other recent writings (Butler &amp; Lehrer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Janes &amp; Sandell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>; Pedretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>; Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>) make similar compelling arguments, pushing conversations and museum practices in new and provocative directions that emphasize criticality and agency.</p>
