<p>The wicked problems of growing socio-economic inequality and climate change led to the
establishment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, but also prompted a
response from national and international social work organizations. Prior to the development of
the SDGs, the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), the International
Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) and the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) had
already established the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development (2012). The Global
Agenda, which was re-imagined in 2020, seeks to promote global social justice based on social
work and social development values. In March 2021, the IFSW and the United Nations Research on
Social Development agency (UNRISD) called for a new global social contract based on
&#8216;solidarity, social cohesion and the need to work together&#8217; (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">IFSW, 2021</xref>, online). Some national social work associations
have identified concomitant sets of agendas for the profession. National responses include the
12 &#8216;grand challenges&#8217; for social work developed by the American Academy of Social
Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW) (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Fong
<italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The challenges span individual and family
issues such as promotion of the healthy development of young people and eradication of domestic
violence; social and community concerns such as the eradication of social isolation, ending
homelessness and creating social responses to a changing environment; and societal challenges
including reducing extreme economic inequality and achievement of equal opportunity and
justice. National developments elsewhere include the launch in February 2021 of the Irish
Association of Social Workers&#8217; (IASW) inaugural Social Work Anti-Racism Strategic
Plan.</p>
