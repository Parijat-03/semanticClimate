The substance of climate justice proceeds from recognition that &#8216;the most vulnerable and poorest in society often have to suffer the greatest impact of the effects of climate change&#8217; (EESC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>, 3.1). There is therefore a &#8216;need to ensure the most vulnerable in society do not have to bear an unfair burden and that the cost of a transition to a climate responsive economic model is spread fairly across society&#8217; (Ibid, 4.1.5). Policy responses consistent with climate justice can &#8216;provide an overarching integrated approach to ensure that the transition to a low carbon economy is achieved in a fair and equitable manner&#8217; (Ibid, 3.3&#8211;3.4). As the EESC noted, this must be pursued in relation to areas including consumption, labour, health, energy and migration, where existing inequalities can be affected by climate measures. The European Commission&#8217;s proposal for the EGD addressed each of these elements of climate justice, with a major focus on just transition (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>).</p>
