<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Reviewer #3:&#160;The paper uses vulnerabilty estimates from three different indices as well as large scale climate data to assess spatial patterns of variability and forecasts for extreme heat frequency and severity.
