This paper seeks to provide a review of experiences and lessons learned from COVID-19 in the light of risks and systemic gaps in Nigeria and the opportunity it offers for resilience building for pandemics and climate change management. Aligned with this aim, this paper set out to achieve the following objectives:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par7">Assessment and outlining of systemic gaps and risks exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Outlining the relevant features of complexity and resilience for COVID-19 in Nigeria.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Incorporating these features into a framework for addressing the effects of climate change in Nigeria.</p></list-item></list></p>
