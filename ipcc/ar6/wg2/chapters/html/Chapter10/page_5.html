To help achieve this, there is a need to advance the current understanding of climate impacts across sectors and spatio-temporal scales, and improve on the current strategies in planning and budget allocation. More accurate forecasting of extreme events, risk awareness and prioritising individual and collective decision making also need to be addressed (high confidence). Options for Asian countries are transforming the risks of climate change into opportunities for the advancement of projects in the energy sector, including promoting investment in non-fossil energies, securing local natural gas resources, enhancing water harvesting, adopting green building technologies and encouraging multi-stakeholder partnerships. However, there are significant barriers to CRD such as fragmented, reactive governance; inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them; and finance deficits. Some Asian countries and regions offer solutions to overcome these barriers: through use of advanced technologies (in situ observation and remote sensing, a variety of new sensor technologies, citizen science, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools); regional partnerships and learning; improved forecasting capabilities; and better risk awareness (high confidence). {10.5, 10.6}</span></div></body></html>
