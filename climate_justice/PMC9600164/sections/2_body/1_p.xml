Despite compelling evidence that climate change will affect the life of every child born today, an understanding of the effects on adolescents is limited. We argue that it is time for more explicit recognition by health professionals of these impacts on adolescents&#8217; physical and mental health, and also the broader effects on their wellbeing. It is important that health professionals recognise their responsibility to support adolescents and protect their wellbeing from the climate crisis.</p>
