These events, alongside the IPCCs damning <italic>Sixth Assessment Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>) may increase the willingness to accept far-reaching climate action, which we found to be related to support for mitigation. At the same time, these events may decrease hopes that policies can still keep climate change within safe boundaries, which we found to relate positively to support for adaptation.</p>
