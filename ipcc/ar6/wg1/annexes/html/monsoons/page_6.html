At intra-seasonal time scales, equatorial waves (e.g.,&#160;Mekonnen et&#160;al., 2008; Janicot et&#160;al., 2010) and interactions with mid-latitudes and the Mediterranean (e.g.,&#160;Vizy and&#160;Cook, 2009; Roehrig et&#160;al., 2011) have an effect on WAfriM activity. African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), including squall lines, are the prominent weather synoptic scale aspects of the WAfriM, supplying almost all rainfall in the Sahel. The strong coupling between AEWs and MCSs has been investigated in depth, as well as their interactions with the Saharan Heat Low, the moisture supply from East Africa and the Mediterranean region or from near the equator (e.g.,&#160;Diongue et&#160;al., 2002; Brammer and Thorncroft, 2017; Lafore et&#160;al., 2017).

CMIP5 and CMIP6 struggle to reproduce the amplitude of observed decadal variability in the 20th&#160;century and to represent the mean climatology including the northward propagation of the monsoon (Roehrig et&#160;al., 2013; Monerie et&#160;al., 2020; Sow et&#160;al., 2020). A&#160;higher horizontal resolution improves the representation of the intensity and spatial distribution of WAfriM rainfall and related circulation, because of the effects of vegetation, orography and coastlines (Hourdin et&#160;al., 2010; Sylla et&#160;al., 2010; Xue et&#160;al., 2010; Raj et&#160;al., 2019). </span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="258.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="258.6" x1="299.07">The WAfriM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.3 and 8.4.2.4.3.

The monsoonal characteristics of the region include a&#160;pronounced annual maximum of precipitation in boreal summer (June&#8211;July&#8211;August) accompanied by a&#160;surface low-pressure system and an upper-level anticyclone, although the seasonal reversal of the surface winds is primarily limited to the northern Gulf of California. In particular, the summer precipitation in the NAmerM region is dictated by the location of the upper-level anticyclone (Reed, 1933; Castro et&#160;al., 2001). The decay phase of the NAmerM is typically observed during late September to October, when convection migrates from Central to South America (Vera et&#160;al., 2006).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.62" top="534.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 316.93; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="534.6" x1="557.62">Mesoscale variability of the NAmerM comes from the pulsing of the&#160;Gulf of California low-level jet, the intensification/reduction of&#160;the land&#8211;sea contrast (Torres-Alavez et&#160;al., 2014) and moisture surges over the Gulf of California (Vera et&#160;al., 2006). Synoptic variability of the NAmerM is mainly associated with the activity of tropical cyclones and of easterly waves (Stensrud et&#160;al., 1997; Fuller and Stensrud, 2000). In addition, the NAmerM is strongly influenced by ENSO variability at both interannual (Higgins et&#160;al., 1999; Higgins and Shi, 2001) and decadal (e.g.,&#160;Castro et&#160;al., 2001) time scales.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="402.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="402.6" x1="557.6">The region is challenging for climate modelling for several reasons, including complex topography, the importance of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs), and sensitivity to SST bias (e.g.,&#160;Pascale et&#160;al., 2019). Many CMIP3 and CMIP5 models with resolutions coarser than 100&#160;km are unable to realistically resolve the topography of the NAmerM region, thus inducing biases in simulating the monsoon (Geil et&#160;al., 2013). Among other factors, these biases are due to deficiencies in the simulation of the Gulf of California summer low-level flow (Kim et&#160;al., 2008; Pascale et&#160;al., 2017) and to failures in representing properly the diurnal cycle (Risanto et&#160;al., 2019) and the decay (Bukovsky et&#160;al., 2015) of the NAmerM precipitation. Simulations at higher horizontal resolution (i.e., with at least 0.25&#176; grid) exhibit an improved representation of the regional topography, which provides a&#160;better representation of the regional circulation and therefore of the NAmerM (Varuolo-Clarke et&#160;al., 2019). </span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.58" top="198.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 198.6; y1: 208.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="198.6" x1="557.58">The NAmerM is assessed in Sections 8.3.2.4.4, 8.4.2.4.4, Atlas.7.1.3 and Atlas.9.1.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="473.92" top="150.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 315.65; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: YIELBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="150.48" x1="473.92">AV.4.5 The South American Monsoon</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="126.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BIWIRL+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="126.6" x1="557.6">The South American monsoon (SAmerM) is a&#160;regional circulation system characterized by inflow of low-level winds from the Atlantic Ocean toward South America, involving Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and northern Argentina, associated with the development of surface pressure gradients (and intense precipitation) during austral summer (December&#8211;January&#8211;February; DJF).
