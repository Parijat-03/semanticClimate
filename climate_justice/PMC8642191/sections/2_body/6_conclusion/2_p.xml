In the domain of &#8216;sustainable&#8217; or &#8216;green&#8217; finance, China and the EU have been drawing from&#8212;and further developing&#8212;a common toolkit of systemic interventions to redirect the financial system, prominently including standardisation, disclosure requirements and carbon markets. Illustrating the versatility of these financial mechanisms, they are being implemented in starkly different economic and political systems. Adapting the Chinese saying &#8216;same bed, different dreams&#8217; (&#21516;&#24202;&#24322;&#26790;), it is a case of &#8216;common mechanisms, different perspectives&#8217;.</p>
