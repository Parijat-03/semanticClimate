This multi-stakeholder PPP reframed participating government land and food policy to promote cross-national &#8216;agricultural growth corridors,&#8217; enclosing land for large-scale industrial agriculture, and incorporating small producers into corporate value chains, producing foodstuffs primarily for export (Paul and Steinbrecher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>; McKeon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> And two years later, the <italic>UN Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture</italic> (GACSA) formed, with 14 governments and 32 organizations (including food corporations such as Coca-Cola, Dupont, Dow, Monsanto, Walmart, Tyson Foods, and Unilever) to encourage 500 million farmers by 2030 to practice climate-smart agriculture,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> which narrowly focuses on technical fixes at the level of production, net of &#8216;questions concerning power, inequality and access&#8217; (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2018</xref>: 89).</p>
