Considering that most people do not know their exact age, we decided to attribute wide age grades of 10&#160;years to HHs. Both boys and girls start to do agricultural work around 12&#160;years old and usually marry after the age of 25. In this study, we classified household members who do not do agricultural work as children and those that work but are still unmarried as youth. Men and women work until they have no more strength; however, we classified them as elderly after age 70. Elders who could not work any longer, together with children and the disabled (just one in Djobel) were grouped as dependent members of the households.</p>
