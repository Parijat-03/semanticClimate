The federal G.I. Bill did not expressly discriminate on the basis of race, but because of pressure from Southern lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact the federal statute, the law allowed states substantial discretion to implement its provisions (Blakemore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>). As a result, overtly racist laws and polices (not only in the American South) denied to black Americans (and other minorities (Ramos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1998</xref>)) the promise of homeownership, education, and skills that these federal laws provided to white Americans. Today&#8217;s urban segregation and the vast disparities in personal wealth, family wealth, and educational and professional attainment are the lingering products of decades of racist laws, regulations, and policies devised and implemented at all levels of government. Data from 2014 showed that at that time, 72% of white Americans owned their home, while only 43% of black Americans owned their home (Traub et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>).
