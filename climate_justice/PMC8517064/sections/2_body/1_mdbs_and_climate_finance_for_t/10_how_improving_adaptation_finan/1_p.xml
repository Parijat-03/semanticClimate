Action Track 1 on ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all calls for an expansion funding to extra $33 billion/year to sustainably end hunger, as well as targeting more impact investments to small and medium agro-food enterprises. Action Track 2 and 3 on shifting to sustainable consumption patterns calls for the implementation of government-driven mechanisms to achieve true cost accounting to include environmental and nutritional values in food choices and investor-driven mechanisms can include shareholder divestment to avoid harm and social impact investing. Action Track 4 on advancing equitable livelihoods and value distribution has a strong focus on strengthening community level coordination and multisectoral approaches. Action Track 5 on building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stresses calls for an enhancement of investment in holistic food systems approaches that address people-planet prosperity and exploring blended finance facilities and public&#8211;private partnerships (PPP) for mobilizing finance for under-resourced initiatives to drive positive change in the food systems (UN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>).</p>
