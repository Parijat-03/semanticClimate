And it's important to remember that the disaster in Puerto Rico had two levels, the natural and the national&#8212;the human-made disaster of the rejection of Puerto Rico, the colonization of Puerto Rico, and the second-class status of citizenry in Puerto Rico. All of this is emphasized by the fact that our president tried to sell or trade Puerto Rico after the hurricane, threw paper towels at U.S. citizens, saying &#8220;mop up&#8221; after the storm, claimed Puerto Rico was breaking the budget, and said Puerto Ricans should not feel bad because they did not have a &#8220;real&#8221; disaster like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. I wanted to do something for my students that would help them see themselves as active agents with power. Writing a memoir helps a person situate themselves as an active agent because they become the protagonist of the story. I designed what I refer to as a mass-listening project the following semester. I was able to include one hundred undergraduate students in a grant in which I trained them in the ethical collection, transcription, translation, and editing of oral histories.</p>
