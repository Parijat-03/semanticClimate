Emerging science and technology provide powerful capabilities which include scalability and rapid processing of information and uncertainties to enable such integration. For example, a financial institution assessing and reporting climate-related risks, as required by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, from investments in manufacturing may need to combine and integrate a CRA evaluating physical risks from flooding to manufacturing facilities, a CRA evaluating the transition risk from policy changes to the international manufacturing supply chain, and a CRA evaluating the transition risk from carbon taxes to customers in specific markets. Only by integrating all these individual risk assessments&#8212;ideally, dynamically and in real-time&#8212;would the financial institution and the manufacturer be able to understand its full risk exposure and the potential usefulness of its intended responses to the risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The effective integration of individual risk assessments requires standards for interoperability which, in turn, need principles and governance processes involving users, producers of CRA, data providers, and regulators.</p>
