The biological productivity, ecological integrity (which encompasses both functional and structural attributes of ecosystems) or the human value (which includes any bene&#64257;t that people get from the land) of a&#160;given territory can deteriorate as the result of processes triggered at scales that range from a&#160;single furrow (e.g.,&#160;water erosion under cultivation) to the landscape level (e.g.,&#160;salinisation through raising groundwater levels under irrigation). While pressures leading to land degradation are often exerted on speci&#64257;c components of the land systems (i.e., soils, water, biota), once degradation processes start, other components become affected through cascading and interactive effects. For example, different pressures and degradation processes can have convergent effects, as can be the case of overgrazing leading to wind erosion, landscape drainage resulting in wetland drying, and warming causing more frequent burning; all of which can independently lead to reductions of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools as a&#160;second-order process. Still, the reduction of organic matter pools is also a&#160;&#64257;rst-order process triggered directly by the effects of rising temperatures (Crowther et al. 2016) as well as other climate changes such as precipitation shifts (Viscarra Rossel et al. 2014). Beyond this complexity, a&#160;practical assessment of the major land degradation processes helps to reveal and categorise the multiple pathways in which climate change exerts a&#160;degradation pressure (Table&#160;4.1). </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.83" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.87; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.57" x1="565.83">Conversion of freshwater wetlands to agricultural land has historically been a&#160;common way of increasing the area of arable land.

Across land degradation processes, those affecting the soil have received more attention. The most widespread and studied land degradation processes affecting soils are water and wind erosion, which have accompanied agriculture since its onset and are still dominant (Table&#160;4.1). Degradation through erosion processes is not restricted to soil loss in detachment areas but includes impacts on transport and deposition areas as well (less commonly, deposition areas can have their soils improved by these inputs). Larger-scale degradation processes related to the whole continuum of soil erosion, transport and deposition include dune &#64257;eld expansion/displacement, development of gully networks and the accumulation of sediments in natural and arti&#64257;cial water-bodies (siltation) (Poesen and Hooke 1997; Ravi et al. 2010). Long-distance sediment transport during erosion events can have remote effects on land systems, as documented for the fertilisation effect of African dust on the Amazon (Yu et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="303.54"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 322.87; y0: 303.54; y1: 313.04; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="303.54" x1="565.81">Coastal erosion represents a&#160;special case among erosional processes, with reports linking it to climate change. While human interventions in coastal areas (e.g.,&#160;expansion of shrimp farms) and rivers (e.g.,&#160;upstream dams cutting coastal sediment supply), and economic activities causing land subsidence (Keogh and T&#246;rnqvist 2019; Allison et al. 2016) are dominant human drivers, storms and sea-level rise have already left a&#160;signi&#64257;cant global imprint on coastal erosion (Mentaschi et al. 2018). Recent projections that take into account geomorphological and socioecological feedbacks suggest that coastal wetlands may not be reduced by sea level rise if their inland growth is accommodated with proper management actions (Schuerch et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.81" top="147.56"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 323.58; y0: 147.56; y1: 157.06; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="147.56" x1="565.81">Other physical degradation processes in which no material detachment and transport are involved include soil compaction, hardening, sealing and any other mechanism leading to the loss of porous space crucial for holding and exchanging air and water (Hamza and Anderson 2005). A&#160;very extreme case of degradation through pore volume loss, manifested at landscape or larger scales, is ground subsidence. Typically caused by the lowering of groundwater or oil levels, subsidence involves a&#160;sustained collapse of the ground </span></div></body></html>
