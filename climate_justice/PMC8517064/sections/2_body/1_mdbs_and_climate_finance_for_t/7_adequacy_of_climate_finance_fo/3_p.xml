The analysis focusses primarily on financing from the international public sector since data from the domestic public sector and private sector is generally not available. The analysis indicated that tracked climate finance flows to small-scale agriculture in developing countries amounted to an annual average of USD 10 billion in 2017/2018. This represents approximately 1.7% of total climate finance tracked in the same period. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates just how minuscule the share of climate finance flowing to small-scale agriculture within overall climate financing (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Share of annual climate finance in small-scale agriculture relative to other climate finance. </p><p>Source: Chiriac et al.
