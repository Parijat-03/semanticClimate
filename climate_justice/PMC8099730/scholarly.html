However, with the pandemic temporarily overshadowing the climate emergency, COVID-19 could have dramatic consequences for the progress on climate change and human health. While the postponed 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) approaches and governments are due to submit enhanced climate commitments, there is an opportunity to address both crises in tandem.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p> <p id="para20">Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) represent countries' pledges to reduce their emissions, adapt to climate change impacts, and form the basis for national climate action plans to avoid passing dangerous temperature thresholds. They translate the global goal of the Paris Agreement, limiting average global temperature rise to "well below 2Â°C",<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> into national commitments updated on a 5-year basis. The new round of NDCs, to be presented by COP26, represents a renewal of countries' commitment to tackling the climate crisis.<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a></p> <p id="para30">Simultaneously, pandemic-driven global recessions, potential residual changes in societal functioning (eg, travel and consumption) and the near-term response to the COVID-19 crisis will largely determine the direction and pace of climate policy over the next months and years.<a href="#bib3">3</a>, <a href="#bib4">4</a> A successful response to both crises can only succeed when tackled concurrently. NDCs offer a crucial policy platform to connect near-term national climate strategies and COVID-19 recovery efforts. Arguably, therefore, the next 6 months could be the most important decision-making window for both climate change and public health policy in the foreseeable future.<a href="#bib5"><sup>5</sup></a></p> <p id="para40">Here, we examined 48 new or updated NDCs (as of Dec 31, 2020) for their inclusion of COVID-19, representing 75 (40%) of the 191 parties to the Paris Agreement and accounting for about 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> COVID-19 was referenced in 42% NDCs. Based on content analysis, various recurring themes and entry points were discussed in relation to COVID-19 recovery and climate commitments, including altered ambitions, gendered impacts, and human wellbeing (<a href="#tbl1">table</a>). However, most governments did not meaningfully reflect the impacts of the pandemic and worsening climate crisis on their level of commitment. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="tbl1"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table</span> </div></p><p>Recurring themes in new or updated NDC, relating COVID-19 response and recovery to climate change commitments<a href="#tbl1fn1">*</a></p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th align="left"><b>COVID-19 theme in NDC</b></th> <th align="left"><b>UNFCCC parties</b></th> <th align="left"><b>Relevant text example</b></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left">Barrier to ambitious climate action, through factors such as the economic impacts of COVID-19</td> <td align="left">Argentina, Brunei, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Nepal, Panama, Tonga, VietNam</td> <td align="left"><b>Fiji</b>: "...this NDC update recognises that the cost of implementing this target currently stands at US$ 2Â·97 billion between 2017â20305.

A key piece in the improvement of management in the face of climate change and other sectors, such as health, as has been demonstrated in the recent health crisis produced by COVID-19.

They do not provide a comprehensive representation of the content or level of ambition of respective NDCs. Translations of text excerpts were conducted by the authors. An overview of all references to COVID-19 in the 48 NDCs is available in the <a href="#sec1">appendix</a>.</p> </div> </div>  <p /> <p id="para50">Climate ambition barely increased with new climate commitments. As identified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, collective commitments in the 48 new or updated national pledges put nations on a path to cut global emissions by 0Â·5% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. However, emission reductions of at least 45% are needed by 2030 to limit average global temperature rise to 1Â·5Â°C.<a href="#bib2">2</a>, <a href="#bib7">7</a> Several NDCs have specified how the pandemic has altered governments' level of ambition, either positively (15 NDCs) or negatively (14 NDCs). To meet global climate goals all NDCs should improve ambition and transparency by specifying how the pandemic has altered their emission reduction targets, financial flows, support to vulnerable countries, and means of implementation. Strengthened climate targets and well-directed financing at this important stage could help sustain a permanent decline in global emissions while supporting a just, green COVID-19 recovery.</p> <p id="para60">Despite evidence suggesting environmentally restorative fiscal policies to be among the most effective tools for economic recovery, less than one fifth of fiscal spending in 2020 contributed to a green recovery.<a href="#bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> Accordingly, the need for a green recovery from COVID-19 is stated as a priority in only a few climate plans (nine NDCs). Low-income countries are increasingly calling for debt relief and enhanced climate finance.<a href="#bib9"><sup>9</sup></a> Therefore, NDCs could improve their green recovery goals by prioritising debt relief and specifying green recovery finance needs.</p> <p id="para70">To protect global public health from the irrevocable damage to natural systems upon which life depends, health and equity need to be integrated into climate mitigation and adaptation actions. However, analysis of previously submitted NDCs indicates most governments made only a general reference to health or did not mention health at all. In the new or updated NDCs, health was highlighted as a cross-cutting priority for the first time to various extents. Yet, as in previous NDCs, health is still not anchored in a wider alignment of climate and public health policies.<a href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a></p> <p id="para80">The unequitable (health) impacts of climate change and other shocks like COVID-19 should be recognised by prioritising policies and interventions that reduce emissions while offering immediate health, social, and economic benefits. Policies informed by the pandemic can boost the path to resilient, sustainable, net-zero emission societies, using human health and equity as a compass. For example, governments could commit to building climate resilient health systems, and employ well-established pandemic prevention and preparedness mechanisms (eg, early warning systems and prevention of deforestation) thereby managing both health and climate change risks. Numerous complementary frameworks to achieve this goal already exist, including Health-In-All-Policies, Universal Health Coverage, One Health, Planetary Health, and Climate Justice approachesâ although these are currently still largely missing from NDCs.</p> <p id="para90">Over 50% of parties to the Paris Agreement still need to communicate an enhanced climate plan. Although this time lag signifies a worrying delay in enhanced climate ambitions, governments have a valuable opportunity to foster political goodwill and improved coordination by mainstreaming their response to COVID-19 in national climate commitments, stepping up with concrete climate targets and financial reform, and communicating their NDCs well in advance of the COP26. There are several key political windows for countries to step forward with enhanced commitments that address the COVID-19 and climate crisis in tandem (eg, the Leaders' Climate Summit, G7, and G20 summits). The recommendations highlighted in this article can help governments create pandemic-primed NDCs, potentially offering a triple win for safeguarding wellbeing, sustainable economic development, and climate goals.</p> <div class="COI-statement" title="COI-statement"> <p id="para100">KvD received funding by the </p><div class="funding-source" title="funding-source">
