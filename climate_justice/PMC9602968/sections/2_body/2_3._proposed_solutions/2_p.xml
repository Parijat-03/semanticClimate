Dedicated funding to support rural LHD engagement in climate change and health programming is also urgently needed. The Biden&#8211;Harris administration&#8217;s recent investment of 633 million dollars in &#8220;climate-smart and resilient infrastructure [for rural] communities&#8221; [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is one positive precedent. Although these funds primarily support a switch to cleaner energy sources, this effort demonstrates interest in promoting equitable climate change adaptation among rural populations [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, with additional appropriations, CDC could create and resource a rurally tailored version of the BRACE program that accounts for rural LHD capacity constraints and community needs.</p>
