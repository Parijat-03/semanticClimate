<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among settings particularly susceptible to health impacts from climate change are cities with a Mediterranean climate, which include cities in the Mediterranean Basin, the western United States and Mexico, central Chile, the Cape region of South Africa, and south and southwestern Australia [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These cities are located in biogeographical hotspots experiencing some of the strongest effects of climate change [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Mediterranean region, for example, is already warming 20% faster than the global average [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Also noteworthy is the increasing ecological drought in these regions due to the expected increased evapotranspiration and reduced rainfall [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several cities with Mediterranean climate are located on the coast and surrounded by mountainous perimeters. This exposes them both to risks related to sea level rise, such as flooding, erosion, and salinization of river deltas and aquifers, and to risks associated with increased wildfires [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the rich Mediterranean biodiversity is at stake, placing complex ecosystems relationships in jeopardy. This could result in the rising of zoonotic, food and vector borne diseases, also enhanced by the projected increment in temperatures [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
