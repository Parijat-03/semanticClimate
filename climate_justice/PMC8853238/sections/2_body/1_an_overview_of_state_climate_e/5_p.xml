For example, when it comes to the electricity sector and energy efficiency, 20 states have enacted a green building standard requiring public buildings to meet LEED or related standards (DSIRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>; May and Koski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2007</xref>). Another 15 states have adopted an appliance efficiency standard that goes beyond federal requirements. With regard to transportation, 45 states have adopted some form of incentive for hybrid/electric vehicles to date (Hartman and Shields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>).</p>
