The 2021 proposal of the Commission mainly adjusts for country differences in GDP/capita, and thus acknowledges mainly a capacity consideration. In this first group, countries are allocated more emissions (i.e., lower emission reduction burden) for the bulk of the interpretations of the responsibility and equality dimensions, given these Member States are: (a) countries with a higher share of the population in poverty (beyond a mere low <italic>average</italic> GDP/capita), such as Bulgaria or Romania; and (b) countries for which responsibility interpretations result in less future reduction, most often according to all of its possible interpretations, be it low historical emissions (e.g. Bulgaria, Spain, Italy or Portugal), substantial success in emission reduction (Sweden) or renewables expansion (Sweden, Cyprus), or (for most of these countries: and) comparatively low emission per capita starting levels granting least reduction when the remaining carbon budget is allocated equally to individuals across countries.</p>
