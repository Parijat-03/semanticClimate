CSA is designed to be a&#160;pathway towards development and food security built on three pillars: increasing productivity and incomes, enhancing resilience of livelihoods and ecosystems and reducing, and removing GHG emissions from the atmosphere (FAO 2013c).

In many cases, these can be implemented by changing the suites of management practices. For example, enhancing soil organic matter to improve the water-holding capacity of agricultural landscapes also sequesters carbon. In annual cropping systems, changes from conventional tillage practices to minimum tillage can convert the system from one that either provides adaptation or mitigation bene&#64257;ts or neither to one that provides both adaptation and mitigation bene&#64257;ts (Sapkota et al. 2017a; Harvey et al. 2014a). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="279.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 279.55; y1: 289.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="279.55" x1="307.58">Increasing food production by using more fertilisers in agricultural &#64257;elds could maintain crop yield in the face of climate change, but may&#160;result in greater overall GHG emissions.

Attention to underlying socio-economic factors that affect adoption of practices and access to technologies is crucial for enhancing biophysical processes, increasing productivity, and reducing GHG emissions at scale. The Government of India, for example, has started a&#160;programme of climate resilient villages (CRV) as a&#160;learning platform to design, implement, evaluate and promote various climate-smart agricultural interventions, with the goal of ensuring enabling mechanisms at the community level (Srinivasa Rao et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="450.51" top="399.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 399.42; y1: 409.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="399.42" x1="450.51">1.6.4.3 Conservation agriculture</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="375.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 375.52; y1: 385.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="375.52" x1="566.08">Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on the principles of minimum soil disturbance and permanent soil cover, combined with appropriate crop rotation (Jat et al. 2014; FAO 2011e).
