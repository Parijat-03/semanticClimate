Given current assumptions about the heat-tolerance of date palm, however, adverse effects are expected to be small (Aldababseh et al. 2018; Shabani et al. 2015). For some other perennial oasis crops, impacts of temperature increases are already apparent. Between 2004/2005 and 2012/2013, high-mountain oases of Al Jabal Al&#160;Akhdar in Oman lost almost all fruit and nut trees of temperate-zone origin, with the abundance of peaches, apricots, grapes, &#64257;gs, pears, apples, and plums dropping by between 86% and 100% (Al-Kalbani et al. 2016). This implies that that the local climate may not remain suitable for species that depend on cool winters to break their dormancy period (Luedeling et al. 2009). A&#160;similar impact is very probable in Tunisia and Morocco, as well as in other oasis locations in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa (Benmoussa et al. 2007). All these studies expect strong decreases in winter chill, raising concerns that many currently well-established species will no longer be viable in locations where they are grown today. The risk of detrimental chill shortfalls is expected to increase gradually, slowly diminishing the economic prospects to produce such species. Without adequate adaptation actions, the consequences of this development for many traditional oasis settlements and other plantations of similar species could be highly negative.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="423.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 423.56; y1: 433.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="423.56" x1="313.23">At the same time, population growth and agricultural expansion in many oasis settlements are leading to substantial increases in water demand for human consumption (Al-Kalbani et al. 2014). For example, a&#160;large unmet water demand has been projected for future scenarios in the valley of Seybouse in East Algeria (Aoun-Sebaiti et al. 2014), and similar conclusions were drawn for Wadi El Natrun in Egypt (Switzman et al. 2018). Modelling studies have indicated long-term decline in available water and increasing risk of water shortages&#160;&#8211; for example, for oases in Morocco (Johannsen et al. 2016; Karmaoui et al. 2016), the Dakhla oasis in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert (Sefelnasr et al. 2014) and for the large Upper Mega Aquifer of the Arabian Peninsula (Siebert et al. 2016). Mainly due to the risk of water shortages, Souissi et al. (2018) classi&#64257;ed almost half of all farmers in Tunisia as non-resilient to climate change, especially those relying on tree crops, which limit opportunities for short-term adaptation actions.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="231.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 231.59; y1: 241.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="231.59" x1="313.25">The maintenance of the oasis systems and the safeguarding of their population&#8217;s livelihoods are currently threatened by continuous water degradation, increasing soil salinisation, and soil contamination (Besser et al. 2017).
