FAO estimated that an additional $265 billion per year would be needed to generate the level of agricultural growth and rural development needed to eradicate poverty and hunger by 2030 (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). This is in addition to estimated annual investment needs of 105 billion/year for adaptation, 480 billion for investments related to mitigation of climate change related to increasing energy end-use efficiency and 600 billion annually for investments in low GHG emissions energy supply. The total estimate of investment needs is 1,452 billion per year (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). The Ceres 2030 project estimated that ODA should increase by US 14 billion/year from a current level of 12 billion/year and public sector investments on the part of low and middle countries by 19 billion/year to eradicate hunger and double agricultural productivity amongst smallholder producers by 2030 (Ceres 2030,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). The additional public sector spending is expected to generate an additional 52 billion/year of private sector resources (Laborde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>).</p>
