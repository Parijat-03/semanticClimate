In doing so, they draw attention to the political economy of transport and mobility justice and strongly acknowledge the role of broader processes of colonialism and neoliberalism in generating mobility injustices. They constitute practical and situated examples of ways to articulate difference and challenge the practice of planning mobilities for a &#8216;universalised disembodied subject&#8217; whilst &#8211; like Sheller &#8211; placing the causes of mobility injustices at a variety of scales.</p>
