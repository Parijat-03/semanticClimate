In the work of Glennon et al. [<xref rid="B64-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], the authors developed a smart technique for quick detection of the sodium content of sweat. The unit appears in two ways, one that resembles a vertically placed watch and can be worn round an animal leg, and the other that looks like a horizontal pod. Both come with a Velcro strap that can be used to attach it to the animal skin. The systems, through capillary action, receive sweat via its orifice, and send it through an electrode that is sensitive to sodium. The electrode in turn sends it into a storage section containing an adsorbent substance. Sweat flow rate can be improved by varying the width of the sweat flow channel in-between electrode and the storage section of the system. Sweat flow rate generally decreases with decreased width of the flow channel. This also determines the length of time the system will be used before the electrode and the adsorbent material are changed. Stored sweat is available for measurement as total harvested sweat volume as well as its sodium concentration per time. Electrode signals are moved to an electronic board that possesses high input impedance for voltage capturing. Results of this analysis are sent to a remote base station, which is either a laptop, or mobile phone, using bluetooth technology for onward visualization and possible storage. </p>
