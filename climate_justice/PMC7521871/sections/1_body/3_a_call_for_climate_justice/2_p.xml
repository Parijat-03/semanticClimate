Many rural and frequently indigenous communities face increasing environmental regulation and forest use restrictions despite their relatively smaller carbon footprints (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Jurjonas and Seekamp, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Corbera et al., 2007</xref>), as well as international pressure from aid and conservation NGOs (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Osborne, 2015</xref>), despite a record of good stewardship in many cases (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Pazos-Almada and Bray, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, transportation emissions&#8211;including air travel&#8211;are approached from an engineering perspective to improve efficiency or with a behavioral change approach to promote more responsible consumers (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Bhowmik et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Higham et al., 2019</xref>), while individualized regulation or top-down approaches face heavy resistance (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boucher, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Becken, 2007</xref>). Ultimately, flight as a contribution to climate change is externalized and rationalized (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Becken, 2007</xref>) and carbon credit schemes or carbon taxes remain distant solutions (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boucher, 2017</xref>).</p>
