Foremost here is deliberately and visibly placing human rights at the center of all CFS policy processes. The right to food is inseparable from other rights, and from social, economic&#160;and environmental justice. Governments as duty bearers have legal obligations to ensure that these rights are upheld. The Voluntary Guidelines for the Right to Food are a major policy product of the CFS, and remind us that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interdependent.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn22">22</xref> The right to food would serve as the unifying element across the different policy processes, not be subject to &#8216;trade-offs&#8217; and provide the impetus for integrating human, and collective rights enshrined in other multilateral conventions and declarations (for e.g., CEDAW, UNDRIP, UNDROP, ILO conventions, etc.) in relevant policy processes. The right to food and FSN cannot be achieved without ensuring the full respect, protection and fulfilment of workers,&#8217; women&#8217;s, peasants&#8217;, fishers&#8217; and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and the dismantling of patriarchal, feudal, racial and neoliberal power relations. The structural social, cultural and economic barriers to the rights of women and girls, and respect for their rights to self-determination must be addressed in all CFS policy processes (Claeys and Duncan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>).</p>
