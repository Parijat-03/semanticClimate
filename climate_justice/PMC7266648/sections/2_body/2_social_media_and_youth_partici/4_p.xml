Virtual violence and harassment in online spaces have forcefully attempted to exclude these marginalised groups from the digital public sphere and are well-documented. In this context, youth within established democracies, despite having access to these virtual public spheres, form a part of not only the subaltern identity due to their cultural standing, but also the repression they experience from institutions such as the education system (Spivak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1988</xref>). As such, their participation, much like any other faction of subaltern society, is intensely contested (Hartounian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>; Dhrodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>).</p>
