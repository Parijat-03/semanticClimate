<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Before presenting the results of our statistical analysis, it is useful to consider the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon geographic distributions of the UHRI and NDVI in the NCT of Delhi. The ward level distributions of our dependent variables are shown as classified choropleth maps where wards are grouped into quintiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-04800-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Although UHRI values were higher in May, wards with greater UHRI in both May and September (highest quintile or top 20%) are located mainly in an east&#8211;west belt across the central part of the NCT of Delhi&#8212;including Najafgarh, West, Rohini, Narela, Civil Lines, and the Shahdara North and South zones. In contrast to these spatial patterns of the UHRI, wards with greater NDVI in both May and September are located in a north&#8211;south belt across the eastern part of the NCT, including the South, Central, New Delhi, and City zones. Southern Delhi shows especially high relative vegetation in both May and September, with the northern and southwestern peripheries of the NCT showing increases in September. The spatial distribution of lower UHRI and higher NDVI corresponds with the landscape factors of the Delhi Ridge and the Yamuna River. Higher vegetation patterns in September appear to spatially coincide with rural and agricultural areas in northern and southwestern Delhi.</p>
