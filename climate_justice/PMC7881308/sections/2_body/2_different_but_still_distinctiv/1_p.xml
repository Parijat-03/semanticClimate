The students receive feedback on their contributions and are given opportunities to engage in structured reflection to explore issues raised by their experiences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn31">31</xref> Those academics responsible for clinical programmes need to be flexible and mindful enough to adapt their practices to new circumstances informed by the enduring principles of clinical pedagogy. These relate to social justice, respectful relationships, collaborative learning, reflective practice, and community service with an emphasis on the well-being, safety, and security of all participants.</p>
