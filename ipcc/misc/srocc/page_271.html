IPBES (2018a) identi&#64257;ed cropland expansion, unsustainable land management practices including overgrazing by livestock, urban expansion, infrastructure development, and extractive industries as the main drivers of land degradation. IPBES (2018a) also found that the ultimate driver of land degradation is high and growing consumption of land-based resources,&#160;e.g.,&#160;through deforestation and cropland expansion, escalated by population growth.

Climate change is projected to reduce crop yields across dryland areas (Sections&#160;3.4.1 and&#160;5.2.2), potentially reducing local production of food and feed. Without research breakthroughs mitigating these productivity losses through higher agricultural productivity, and reducing food waste and loss, meeting the increasing food demands of growing populations will require expansion of cropped areas to more marginal areas (with most prime areas in drylands already being under cultivation) (Lambin 2012; Lambin et al. 2013; Eitelberg et al. 2015; Guti&#233;rrez-Elorza 2006; Kapovi&#263; Solomun et al. 2018). Borrelli et al. (2017) showed that the primary driver of soil erosion in 2012 was cropland expansion. Although local food demands could also be met by importing from other areas, this would mean increasing the pressure on land in those areas (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011). The net effects of such global agricultural production shifts on land condition in drylands are not known. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="519.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 519.58; y1: 529.08; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="519.58" x1="571.77">Climate change will exacerbate poverty among some categories of dryland populations (Sections&#160;3.4.2 and&#160;3.5.2).

On one hand, it reduces an immediate pressure on land if it leads to less dependence on land for livelihoods (Chen et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016a). Moreover, migrant remittances could be used to fund the adoption of SLM practices. Labour mobility from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors could allow land consolidation, gradually leading to mechanisation and agricultural intensi&#64257;cation (Wang et al. 2014, 2018). On the other hand, this can increase the costs of labour-intensive SLM practices due to lower availability of rural agricultural labour and/or higher rural wages. Out-migration increases the pressure on land if higher wages that rural migrants earn in urban centres will lead to their higher food consumption. Moreover, migrant remittances could also be used to fund land-use expansion to marginal areas (Taylor et al. 2016; Gray and Bilsborrow 2014). The net effect of these opposite mechanisms varies from place to place (Qin and Liao 2016).
