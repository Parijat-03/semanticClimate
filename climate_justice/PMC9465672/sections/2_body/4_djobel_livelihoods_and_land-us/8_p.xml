This effort was made possible by the return of students and migrants during the rainy season and the support of distant migrants, who sent money to hire labor groups. Villagers also continued planting mangroves in areas near dike ruptures and in destroyed fields to mitigate the negative impacts of strong tides and marine storm events on the dike structure and of intense winds on the houses. They plant randomly and consider their technique more efficient in terms of mud deposition and mangrove forest recovery than the scientific technique, introduced by conservation projects, of planting in lines. To prevent/reduce rice losses from shattering, the villagers also adopted the sickle, and both men and women now harvest quickly (traditionally, women harvested panicle by panicle with a knife).</p>
