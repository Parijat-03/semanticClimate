Biodiversity and ecosystem services, for example, were identified as highly concerning risk multipliers as they play a crucial role in supporting livelihoods, cultural heritage and ways of life in the Pacific. A deep engagement with issues of biodiversity loss is warranted in the Pacific Islands. Combining the fact that biodiversity loss is the most significant loss being experienced now and anticipated in the future with the fact that it is also the least reparable invokes an urgency to act, particularly in ways that conserve and restore ecosystems and biodiversity. This reinforces the need in the Pacific for ecosystem and nature-based solutions as well as approaches that work to enhance people-nature connections, such as existing efforts through the Pacific Blue Economy (SPREP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). We emphasise the need to continue documenting these losses and implementing ecosystem-based solutions with upmost priority. This will help account for and prevent loss risk multipliers across the Pacific Islands.</p>
