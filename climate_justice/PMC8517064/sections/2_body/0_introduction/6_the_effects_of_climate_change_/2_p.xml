Recent studies indicate that climate change has already had a negative impact on crops yields at a global scale, and that adaptation to date has not been sufficient to offset these impacts &#8211; particularly at lower latitudes (Mbouw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>; Ray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>).</p>
