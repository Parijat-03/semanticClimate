Green, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>; Jordan &amp; Matt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>) to build a consensus for more stringent policy. It was shown that certain maritime policies applied by the EU acted as policy feedback to pressure the IMO into adopting similar policies at the global level. The finding above regarding the tension between blocking and accepting regulation is key here, because, above all, private actors want certainty over future regulations and, if possible, a future competitive advantage by being the first to bring new technology to the market. It is possible that shipping lines and shipowners could switch their perspective towards decarbonisation if policy makers have the courage to provide a clear phasing in of future regulations on the supply of fossil fuels and fossil-fuelled ships. MBMs prevent such a transition by embedding business-as-usual but direct regulation by banning fossil-fuelled ships by a certain date could act as policy feedback to build this new industry norm. This does not rule out applying a tax in conjunction with a ban, but the tax on its own will not work.</p>
