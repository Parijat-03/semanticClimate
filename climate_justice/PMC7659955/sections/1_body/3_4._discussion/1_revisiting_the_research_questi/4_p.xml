While CSA strives for the cheapest routes to progress in agriculture, smart village development mostly depends on donations and funding, which slows down the pace of making progress and achieving sustained growth. As a result, for any smart villages project to achieve lasting success, such a project would have to plan self-funding strategies [<xref rid="B10-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], where inputs within the village is used to generate income that would fund new projects for growth, rather than unduly wait for funding before progress is made. In building its growth, smart village planners might need to prioritize new knowledge and link it to new technology for early warning measures against potential environmental disasters. Furthermore, proponents also need to ensure that pillars of climate change are largely considered in building infrastructures [<xref rid="B13-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is because the impact of climate change might continue to be felt for a long time. </p>
