Higher-income areas are often closer to water bodies as these are perceived as desirable amenities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In Harris County, our findings can be partly interpreted through this lens, as proximity to water bodies can pattern on affluence in some areas (such as along recreational trails on the city&#8217;s many bayous) but have the opposite effect in others (such as with low-income Latina/x/o neighborhoods near the Houston Ship Channel which hosts a large number of petrochemical facilities)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, increasing attention must be paid not only to both climate change mitigation and adaptation to lessen these impacts but also to upending the root social inequalities that sustain socio-spatial differentiation in the first place.</p>
