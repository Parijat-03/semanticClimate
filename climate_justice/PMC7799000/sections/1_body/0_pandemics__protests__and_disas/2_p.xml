<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It just so happens that in October 2019, we put up an exhibit called &#8220;Spit Spreads Death,&#8221; about the 1918 influenza pandemic, with an emphasis on Philadelphia. This was one of our most ambitious and expensive exhibitions, mounted with significant help from external organizations such as the Pew Charitable Trusts. It centers on the fourth Liberty Loan Drive parade, held to raise money for the World War I effort, but also the reason that Philadelphia had the highest death rate per capita from the flu among other U.S. cities. Was the money raised? Yes. But thousands of people died in the weeks after the parade. While we cannot state empirically that the parade was the catalyst of the flu outbreak, the preponderance of evidence weighs heavily in favor of this hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref></sup></p>
