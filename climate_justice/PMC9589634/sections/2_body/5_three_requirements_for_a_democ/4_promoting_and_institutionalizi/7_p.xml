We have argued, however, that its use must not come with an expectation of blind deference&#8212;to use Lafont&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>) terminology. However, it seems unrealistic to expect that at any time all citizens agree on decisions in full awareness of all relevant evidence and arguments. There is thus certainly some need for deference in modern mass societies. But in order to <italic>not blindly defer</italic>, citizens must have both the capability to exercise some kind of control over their rulers and the ability to decide &#8216;when and how far&#8217; they want to defer (Goodin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>, p. 25). We consider the three requirements we have suggested here as necessary to enable citizens to exercise these capabilities.</p>
