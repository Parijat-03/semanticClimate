Section&#160;8.2 offers a&#160;companion discussion focussing on changes in the water cycle. An example of how changes in one region could act as a&#160;source for changes in a&#160;neighbouring one is assessed in the Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.1 for the linkages between polar and mid-latitude regions, an interaction that has led to substantial recent research. This section also introduces the sources of uncertainty in model-derived regional climate information and how the quantification of the uncertainties influences the confidence of the regional climate information.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="238.94" top="594.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="594.48" x1="238.94" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 594.48; y1: 604.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.1.3.1 Forcings Controlling Regional Climate</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="570.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="570.6" x1="304.73" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There are important differences in the processes affected by greenhouse gases (GHGs) over land and ocean.

The 11-year solar cycle has been suggested to affect the leading atmospheric circulation modes of the North Atlantic region in model-based studies (Gray et&#160;al., 2013; Thi&#233;blemont et&#160;al., 2015; Sjolte et&#160;al., 2018). In particular the solar cycle has been suggested as an important source of near-term predictability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Kushnir et&#160;al., 2019), while other studies have not found evidence for links between the solar cycle and NAO in observational records (Ortega et&#160;al., 2015; Sjolte et&#160;al., 2018; Chiodo et&#160;al., 2019). On centennial time scales, solar fluctuations were found to be correlated with the Eastern Atlantic Pattern (Sjolte et&#160;al., 2018). Possible influences on winter circulation and temperature over Eurasia (Chen et&#160;al., 2015) and North America (Liu et&#160;al., 2014; Li and Xiao, 2018) have also been identified.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="306.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="306.6" x1="304.77" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An updated assessment of past changes in stratospheric ozone can be found in Section&#160;2.2.5.2.

The poleward shift of the SH westerlies has also been explained by stratospheric ozone depletion (Solman and Orlanski, 2016). Section&#160;10.4 assesses its role in the multi-decadal increase of rainfall in south-eastern South America and Section&#160;10.6.2 does so for the occurrence of the Cape Town drought.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.71" top="126.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="126.6" x1="304.71" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Both natural and anthropogenic aerosols are often emitted at a&#160;regional scale, have a&#160;short atmospheric lifetime (from a&#160;few hours to several days; Section&#160;6.1), are dispersed regionally and affect climate at a&#160;regional scale through radiative cooling/heating and cloud microphysical effects (Chapter&#160;8; Rotstayn et&#160;al., 2015; Sherwood et&#160;al., 2015).

Li et&#160;al., 2016; K. Li et&#160;al., 2016; Mallet et&#160;al., 2016). Black carbon, instead, is known to absorb solar radiation, leading to regional atmospheric warming patterns due to its inhomogeneous spatial distribution (Gustafsson and Ramanathan, 2016). Patterns of forcing generally follow those of aerosol burden. However, temperature and precipitation responses are both local and remote (Z. Li et&#160;al., 2016; Kasoar et&#160;al., 2018; L. Liu et&#160;al., 2018; Samset et&#160;al., 2018; Thornhill et&#160;al., 2018; Westervelt et&#160;al., 2018). For instance, changes in aerosol concentrations in the NH have been reported to modulate monsoon precipitation in West Africa and the Sahel (Undorf et&#160;al., 2018; Section&#160;10.4.2.1) and in Asia (H. Zhang et&#160;al., 2018; Section&#160;10.6.3).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="570.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="570.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Natural aerosols include mineral dust, volcanic aerosol and sea salt. The feedback processes between climate and mineral dust as well as sea salt are assessed in Section&#160;6.4, while the volcanic aerosol is dealt with in Cross-Chapter Box&#160;4.1. Mineral dust created by wind erosion of arid and semi-arid surfaces dominates the aerosol load over some areas. The major sources of contemporary dust are located in the arid topographic basins of northern Africa, Middle East, Central and south-west Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and East Asia&#160;(Prospero et&#160;al., 2002; Ginoux et&#160;al., 2012) and emissions are controlled by changes in surface winds, precipitation, and vegetation (Ridley et&#160;al., 2014; W. Wang et&#160;al., 2015; DeFlorio et&#160;al., 2016; Evan et&#160;al., 2016; Pu and Ginoux, 2018). Dust both scatters and absorbs radiation and serves as a&#160;nuclei of warm and cold clouds (Chapter&#160;6). The surface direct radiative effect is likely negative over land and ocean, especially when the assumed solar absorption by dust is large (Miller et&#160;al., 2014; Strong et&#160;al., 2015). Surface temperature and precipitation adjust to the direct radiative effect with both sign and magnitude depending on the dust absorptive properties. Dust often cools the surface,&#160;but in regions such as the Sahara surface air temperature increases as the shortwave absorption by dust is increased, leading to increases of surface temperature over the major reflective dust sources (Miller et&#160;al., 2014; Solmon et&#160;al., 2015; Strong et&#160;al., 2015; Jin et&#160;al., 2016; Sharma and Miller, 2017).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="282.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="282.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.31; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Volcanic eruptions load the atmosphere with large amounts of sulphur, which is transformed through chemical reactions and micro-physics processes into sulphate aerosols (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;4.1; Stoffel et&#160;al., 2015; LeGrande et&#160;al., 2016). If the plume reaches the stratosphere, sulphate aerosols can remain there for months or years (about two to three for large eruptions) and can then be transported to other areas by the Brewer-Dobson circulation. If the eruption occurs in the tropics, its plume is dispersed across the Earth in a&#160;few years, while if the eruption occurs in the high latitudes, aerosols mainly remain in the same hemisphere (Pausata et&#160;al., 2015). The global temperature response observed after the last five major eruptions of the last two&#160;centuries is estimated to be around &#8211;0.2&#176;C (Swingedouw et&#160;al., 2017), in association with a&#160;general decrease of precipitation (Iles and Hegerl, 2017). Nevertheless, the statistical significance of the regional response remains difficult to evaluate over the historical era (Bittner et&#160;al., 2016; Swingedouw et&#160;al., 2017) due to the small sampling of large volcanic eruptions over this period and the fact that the signal is superimposed upon relatively large internal variability (Gao and Gao, 2018; Dogar and Sato, 2019). Evidence from paleoclimate observations is therefore crucial to obtain a&#160;sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (Sigl&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2015). </span></div></body></html>
