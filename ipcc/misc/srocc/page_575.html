Over the past years, the frequency of droughts, cyclones, and hailstorms has increased, with severe droughts in eight of 15 years between 2002 and 2017 (Srinivasa Rao et&#160;al. 2016; Mujumdar et&#160;al. 2017). Such droughts result in large yield declines for major crops like wheat in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Zhang et&#160;al. 2017). The development of a submersible pump technology in the 1990s, combined with public policies that provide farmers with free electricity for groundwater irrigation, resulted in a dramatic increase in irrigated agriculture (Shah et&#160;al. 2012). This shift has led to increased dependence on irrigation from groundwater and induced a groundwater crisis, with large impacts on socio-ecosystems. An increasing number of farmers report bore-well failures, either due to excessive pumping of an existing well or a lack of water in new wells. The decrease in the groundwater table level has suppressed the recharge of river beds, turning permanent rivers into ephemeral streams (Srinivasan et&#160;al. 2015). Wells have recently been drilled in upland areas, where groundwater irrigation is also increasing (Robert et&#160;al. 2017). Additional challenges include declining soil organic matter and fertility under monocultures and rice/wheat systems. Unoccupied land is scarce, meaning that the potential for expanding the area farmed is very limited (Aggarwal et&#160;al. 2018). In rural areas, diets are de&#64257;cient in protein, dietary &#64257;bre and iron, and mainly comprised of cereals and pulses grown and/or procured through welfare programmes (Vatsala et&#160;al. 2017). Cultivators are often indebted, and suicide rates are much higher than the national average, especially for those strongly indebted (Merriott 2016). Widespread use of diesel pumps for irrigation, especially for paddies, high use of inorganic fertilisers and crop residue burning lead to high GHG emissions (Aggarwal et&#160;al. 2018). The Climate-Smart Village (CSV) approach aims at increasing farm yield, income, input use ef&#64257;ciency (water, nutrients, and energy) and reducing GHG emissions (Aggarwal et&#160;al. 2018). Climate-smart agriculture interventions are considered in a broad sense by including practices, technologies, climate information services, insurance, institutions, policies, and &#64257;nance. Options differ based on the CSV site, its agro-ecological characteristics, level of development, and the capacity and interest of farmers and the local government (Aggarwal et&#160;al. 2018). Selected interventions included crop diversi&#64257;cation, conservation agriculture (minimum tillage, residue retention, laser levelling), improved varieties, weather-based insurance, agro-advisory services, precision agriculture and agroforestry. Farmers&#8217; cooperatives were established to hire farm machinery, secure government credit for inputs, and share experiences and knowledge. Tillage practices and residue incorporation increased rice&#8211;wheat yields by 5&#8211;37%, increased income by 28&#8211;40%, reduced GHG emissions by 16&#8211;25%, and increased water-use ef&#64257;ciency by 30% (Jat et&#160;al. 2015). The resulting portfolio of options proposed by the CSV approach has been integrated with the agricultural development strategy of some states like Haryana.</span></div><div left="79.37" right="369.78" top="351.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.37; y0: 351.42; y1: 361.42; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="351.42" x1="369.78">E.

Increased mortality and morbidity from extreme heat events are exacerbated in urban populations by the urban heat island effect (Gabriel and Endlicher 2011; Schatz and Kucharik 2015), which can be limited by developing green infrastructure in cities. Urban green infrastructure includes public and private green spaces&#160;&#8211; such as remnant native vegetation, parks, private gardens, golf courses, street trees, urban farming&#160;&#8211; and more engineered options, such as green roofs, green walls, bio&#64257;lters and raingardens (Norton et&#160;al. 2015). Increasing the amount of vegetation, or green infrastructure, in a city is one way to help reduce urban air temperature maxima and variation. Increasing vegetation by 10% in Melbourne, Australia was estimated to reduce daytime urban surface temperatures by approximately 1&#176;C during extreme heat events (Coutts and Harris 2013). Urban farming (a type of urban green infrastructure) is largely driven by the desire to reconnect food production and consumption (Whittinghill and Rowe 2012) (Chapter 5). Even though urban farming can only meet a very small share of the overall urban food demand, it provides fresh and local food, especially perishable fruits and crops that are usually shipped from far and sold at high prices (Thomaier et&#160;al. 2015). Food-producing urban gardens and farms are often started by grassroots initiatives (Ercilla-Montserrat et&#160;al. 2019) that occupy vacant urban spaces. In recent years, a growing number of urban farming projects (termed Zero-Acreage farming, or Z-farming, Thomaier et&#160;al. 2015) were established in and on existing buildings, using rooftop spaces or abandoned buildings through contracts between food businesses and building owners. Almost all Z-farms are located in cities with more than 150,000 inhabitants, with a majority in North American cities such as New York City, Chicago and Toronto (Thomaier et&#160;al. 2015). They depend on the availability of vacant buildings and roof tops, thereby competing with other uses, such as roof-based solar systems. Urban farming, however, has potentially high levels of soil pollution and air pollutants, which may lead to crop contamination and&#160;health risks. These adverse effects could be reduced on rooftops (Harada et&#160;al. 2019) or in controlled environments.</span></div></body></html>
