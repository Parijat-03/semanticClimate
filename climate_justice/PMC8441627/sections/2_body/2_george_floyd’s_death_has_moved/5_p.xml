<p>There is a &#8216;beauty&#8217; in Trump&#8217;s ability to reveal how vulnerable and manipulatable our American systems are, and how serious are the divisions and inequities in American society. It took the crisis of the pandemic to begin to change the course of his presidency. Trump was so inept as a leader, and so locked into the decay of Neo&#8208;liberalism, plus in dread fear that his hope for re&#8208;election, the economy, would collapse that he was incapable of a humane response to the pandemic. His support of gun&#8208;toting men rallying in front of state capitols to force governors to prematurely open state economies was a disturbing reminder of the lengths he went to in order to get re&#8208;elected. Paramilitary organizations and a vigilante mentality that perverts law and justice are themselves a consequence of an American gun culture related to an interpretation of the Second Amendment (Merritt <xref rid="joap12675-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
