Perhaps the most famous kind of such deadline rhetoric is the Doomsday Clock that was created by the <italic>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</italic> in 1947. The origin of Doomsday Clock was a great fear of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, in particular a nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Using the minutes left until &#8216;midnight&#8217; as the imagery of apocalypse, the clock was invented to warn the public about how close the world is approaching catastrophe, originally from nuclear weapons, but now including the danger caused by climate change. The remaining time to midnight is reset every year and decided by scientists and experts on the <italic>Bulletin</italic>&#8217;s board. The hands of the clock have no literal meaning; they are a metaphor&#8212;&#8216;a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet&#8217;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> Despite its metaphoric characteristic, the Doomsday Clock has become a powerful symbol that captures people&#8217;s minds and stokes their anxieties over an existential threat to humanity (Vuori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>).</p>
