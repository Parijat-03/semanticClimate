For the past 12,000 years, the earth&#8217;s global climate has remained relatively stable in comparison with previous geological time periods, allowing for the development, expansion, and eventual flourishing of human civilization. Known as the Holocene geological period, this period directly followed the Pleistocene epoch, known more commonly as the Ice Age, when climate conditions were often much colder, drier, and, in general, more unpredictable. But as the ice sheets retreated, hunter-gatherer humans could begin farming the land en masse, which gave rise to an &#8220;agricultural revolution&#8221; with more stable food production and in turn more stable human societies.</p>
