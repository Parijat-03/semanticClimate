<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Resilience building in youth is important as it allows them to be active agents and protagonists for change [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Focusing on the negative impacts of climate change is a &#8216;narrow framework&#8217; and can limit discourse about, and possibility for, resilient and creative approaches to solutions [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, focusing on only individualistic approaches weakens the importance of community and educator&#8217;s roles in supporting young people [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast, strength-based community and participatory approaches shift away from deficit-based concepts and provide a stronger mental health ecosystem to reduce the burden for future generations [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The importance of supporting the mental health resilience of youth and children is further emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and youth are now facing new experiences of disempowerment with the various lifestyle changes which have accompanied the pandemic. Furthermore, the mental health of youth/children is deteriorating, further validating the importance of not only mitigating the impacts of climate change, but also supporting the mental health resiliency of youth and children.</p>
