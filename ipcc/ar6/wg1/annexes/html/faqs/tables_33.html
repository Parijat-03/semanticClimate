Some parts of the climate system take time to react to a change in CO concentration, so\n2\na decline in atmospheric CO as a result of net negative emissions would not lead to immediate reversal of\n2\nall climate change trends. Recent studies have shown that global surface temperature starts to decline within\na few years following a decline in atmospheric CO, although the decline would not be detectable for decades\n2\ndue to natural climate variability (see FAQ 4.2). Other consequences of human-induced climate change, such as\nreduction in permafrost area, would take decades; yet others, such as warming, acidification and oxygen loss\nof the deep ocean, would take centuries to reverse following a decline in the atmospheric CO concentration.\n2\nSea level would continue to rise for many centuries to millennia, even if large deliberate CO removals were\n2</td>

In these scenarios, a slow rate of reduction in emissions in the near term is compensated by net\nnegative CO emissions in the later part of this century, which results in a temporary breach or &#8216;overshoot&#8217; of\n2\na given warming level. Due to the delayed reaction of several climate system components, it follows that the\ntemporary overshoot would result in additional climate changes compared to a scenario that reaches the goal\nwithout overshoot. These changes would take decades to many centuries to reverse, with the reversal taking\nlonger for scenarios with larger overshoot.</td>
