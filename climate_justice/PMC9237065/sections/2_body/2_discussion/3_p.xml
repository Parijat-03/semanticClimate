The dimensions of equality and responsibility, however, are equally important to consider. Introducing them increases the divergence of country reduction targets; countries with the lowest emission reduction targets resulting from capability interpretations alone, such as Bulgaria and Romania, tend to have even lower targets when using a combined approach, thus allowing for reducing their emission reductions for 2030. The converse is true for countries with high reductions from only a capability approach; considering other equity dimensions would lead to considerably higher burdens. This holds largely independently of which interpretations are employed for these two further dimensions.</p>
