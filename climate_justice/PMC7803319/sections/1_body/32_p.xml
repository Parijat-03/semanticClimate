Demonstrations have become increasingly popular among young people, who are aware of the consequences of global warming and how they will affect their future. What began as a protest by a 16-year-old Swedish girl, Greta Thunberg, became a global campaign in 2018, joined by more than 20,000 students. Greta Thunberg was invited to speak on behalf of young people at various international courts [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As part of the global movement on school strikes, Greenhouse PR has mobilized support for the UK's Student Climate Network and helped increase participation in the largest climate strike in history. Thus, on September 20, 2019, more than 350,000 people took to the streets in the UK, creating unprecedented interest in climate protests, showing huge public support for urgent climate action that exists around the world.</p>
