First, we discussed that transforming capability thresholds to HDI, which are relevant to some capabilities, reveals a diminishing marginal utility rate between HDI and energy consumption (measured as GJ per capita). This means that even modest increases in energy availability for the least well-off will have substantial impacts on some of their capabilities. Conversely, it means that even substantial reductions in energy use per capita of the most well-off will have a minuscule effect on their well-being Second, we suggested that utilising this framework is instructive when setting ceilings&#8212;namely, setting restrictions on energy use per capita&#8212;without pushing anyone below the threshold. Third, we argued that the distance between the threshold and the ceiling for each generation diminishes as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. This means that a non-tragic choice now shades into a tragic choice later, where choices must be made on whose capabilities to sacrifice and by what principles.</p>
