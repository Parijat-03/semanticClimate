The ability to simulate the effect of volcanic aerosol in global models is evaluated in VolMIP (Zanchettin et&#160;al., 2016). Given the relevance of volcanic aerosol, a&#160;good knowledge of the initial conditions is important because the response has proven to be sensitive to them (M&#233;n&#233;goz et&#160;al., 2018a; Zanchettin et&#160;al., 2019). A&#160;few decadal prediction systems have illustrated that current systems can predict some aspects of regional climate a&#160;few years in advance (Swingedouw et&#160;al., 2017; Illing et&#160;al., 2018; M&#233;n&#233;goz et&#160;al., 2018a; Hermanson et&#160;al., 2020). However, a&#160;better performance requires information about volcanic location (Haywood et&#160;al., 2013; Pausata et&#160;al., 2015; Stevenson et&#160;al., 2016; F. Liu et&#160;al., 2018a), strength (Emile-Geay et&#160;al., 2008; H.-G. Lim et&#160;al., 2016; F.

Examples of the importance of correctly representing anthropogenic aerosols are the recent enhanced warming over Europe (Nabat et&#160;al., 2014; Dong et&#160;al., 2017), the cooling over the East Asian monsoon region, leading to a&#160;weakening of the monsoon (Section&#160;8.3.2.4; Song et&#160;al., 2014; Q. Wang et&#160;al., 2017), as well as changes in the monsoons of West Africa (Sections 8.3.2.4 and 10.4.2.1) and South Asia (Sections 8.3.2.4 and 10.6.3; Undorf et&#160;al., 2018). The relevance of appropriately representing anthropogenic aerosols has been widely studied in regional models (Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020a; Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2020), with an advantage for models with interactive aerosol schemes (Drug&#233; et&#160;al., 2019; Nabat et&#160;al., 2020). Without a&#160;fully coupled chemistry module, radiative forcing can be simulated by including simple models of sulphate chemistry or specifying the optical properties from observations and prescribing the effect of aerosols on the cloud-droplet number (Fiedler et&#160;al., 2017, 2019; Stevens et&#160;al., 2017). In all cases, the specification of the aerosol load limits the trustworthiness of the simulations at the regional scale when enough detail is not provided (Samset et&#160;al., 2019; Shonk et&#160;al., 2020; Z. Wang&#160;et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="210.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="210.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 210.6; y1: 220.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The inclusion of irrigation in global and regional models over the South Asian monsoon region (Section&#160;10.6.3) has been found to be important to represent the monsoon circulation and rainfall correctly (Lucas-Picher et&#160;al., 2011; Guimberteau et&#160;al., 2012; Shukla et&#160;al., 2014; Tuinenburg et&#160;al., 2014; Cook et&#160;al., 2015a; Devanand et&#160;al.,&#160;2019). Similarly, the inclusion of irrigation over northern India and western Pakistan could be important for the correct simulation of precipitation over the Upper Indus Basin in northern Pakistan (Saeed et&#160;al., 2013). Irrigation in the East African Sahel inhibits rainfall over the irrigated region and instead enhances rainfall to the east, coherent with both observations and theoretical understanding of the local circulation anomalies induced by the lower surface air temperatures over the irrigated region (Alter et&#160;al., 2015). Although several studies show how modelled irrigation reduces </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.84; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">observations. Global model studies have found improvements in simulated surface temperature when including irrigation (Thiery et&#160;al., 2017), in particular in areas where the model used has a&#160;strong land-atmosphere coupling (Chen and Dirmeyer, 2019). An&#160;RCM study over the North China Plain showed that the inclusion of irrigation led to a&#160;better representation of the observed nighttime warming (Chen and Jeong, 2018).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="339.19" top="618.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="618.6" x1="339.19" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 618.6; y1: 628.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 339.26; x1: 346.12; y0: 618.6; y1: 628.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="339.26" y0="618.6" x1="411.95">medium confidence </span><span x0="412.01" y0="618.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 412.01; x1: 414.82; y0: 618.6; y1: 628.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that representing irrigation is important for a&#160;realistic simulation of South Asian monsoon precipitation.

The VALUE initiative has assessed a&#160;range of such methods in a&#160;perfect-predictor experiment where the predictors are taken from reanalysis data (Maraun et&#160;al., 2015, 2019a; Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019). Table&#160;10.2 shows an overview comprising performance results from VALUE and other studies. These results isolate the performance of the statistical method in the present climate. The overall performance in a&#160;climate change application also depends on the performance of the driving climate model (Sections 10.3.3.3&#8211;10.3.3.6) and the fitness of both the driving model and the statistical method for projecting the climatic aspects of interest (Section&#160;10.3.3.9).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="501.35" top="210.6"><span style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.82; y0: 210.6; y1: 220.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="309.26" y0="210.6" x1="501.35">10.3.3.7.1 Performance of perfect prognosis methods</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="186.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="186.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.83; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Perfect prognosis methods can perform well when the synoptic forcing (i.e., the explanatory power of large-scale predictors) is strong (Schoof, 2013). Using this approach, downscaling of precipitation is particularly skilful in the presence of strong orographic forcing. The representation of daily variability and extremes requires analogue methods or stochastic regression models, although the former typically do not extrapolate to unobserved values (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019; Hertig et&#160;al., 2019). Temporal precipitation variability is well-represented by analogue methods and stochastic regression, but analogue methods typically underestimate temporal dependence of temperature (Maraun et&#160;al., 2019b). Spatial dependence of both temperature and precipitation is only well-represented by analogue </span></div></body></html>
