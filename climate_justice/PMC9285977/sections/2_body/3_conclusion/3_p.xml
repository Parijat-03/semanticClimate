<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One surprising finding is that despite calls within the policy arena, the literature on climate change governance in urban areas has shown a limited engagement with the role of private sector actors, particularly considering the important role that businesses have in shaping urban governance (Klein et al., <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0172" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). There is a well&#8208;developed critique of the appropriation of climate change action as a new means to advance neoliberal policies of securitization, measurement, and control. While this critical angle has provided useful insights about the interactions between planning, action, and impact, the scant body of literature that engages with the role of the private sector in climate action falls short of examining the possibilities to deliver actual results on the ground.</p>
