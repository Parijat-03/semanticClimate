Say, for example, we don't have any Latinx items in our collection. We go down to this bodega. They've been here for generations. We're going to ask them for their stuff, and they're going to sign over their rights. Then we're going to digitize their items and put them all over the Internet and create an exhibit. Sounds great. It's just not fair to those people because you didn't really have a discussion with them. You haven't expressed to them the meaning of their donation and how it would be used. You're stripping somebody's family business or a community's materials and taking them miles away.</p>
