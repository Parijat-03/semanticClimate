The inhabitants later decided to build two dams, a major contour dike and a canal to divert one sea arm, and many secondary dikes to allow for rice cultivation and the movement of people by foot during the rainy season. Thus, they created a polder in previous swampy land covered with mangroves, brackish water and mudflats (ibid). Soon, the island became known in the region as "<italic>Essuck Eman&#243;</italic>", literally meaning land of rice in Diola.</p>
