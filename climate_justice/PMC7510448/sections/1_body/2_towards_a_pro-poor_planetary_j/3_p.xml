<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0090">First, multiple solutions have been proposed to resolve the global political failure in climate mitigation and other elements of the planetary crisis, ranging from global degrowth strategies, carbon taxes, or the redirecting of fossil fuel subsidies to the development of renewables. However, many such policies do not focus on advancing the interests of the poor, or may even increase the burden on the poorest. Therefore, a pro-poor justice strategy calls for robust international institutional frameworks that explicitly focus on supporting the interests of the poor. Any institutionalist reform, especially at the global level, requires careful and systematic scrutiny as to how it affects the situation of the poorest. For example, institutional arrangements that lead to large-scale unemployment would have to be accompanied by compensatory mechanisms, such as the provision of basic income for the poorest.</p>
