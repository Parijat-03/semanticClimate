Each author then evaluated the methods and findings of their assigned studies, performed an initial synthesis of the literature for their assigned topics, and presented their evaluation and synthesis to the full research team. The full research team collaboratively judged the interpretation and relevance of each study and synthesized the collective findings. Our findings are organized by the following research lenses, which emerged from this process:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par25"><italic>Existing company engagement with SBTs</italic>: what drives companies to set SBTs, how does SBT adoption affect company climate action, and are companies on track to achieve their SBTs?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26"><italic>Appraisal of SBT methods and governance</italic>: do target-setting methods and governance align collective corporate action to the Paris temperature goal and is corporate emission disclosure sufficient for assessing this alignment?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27"><italic>Prospects of SBT diffusion:</italic> will voluntary SBT adoption continue to grow, will it be sufficient for aligning the private sector to the Paris Agreement, and how might SBTs interact with existing and emerging policy?</p></list-item></list></p>
