IEL is concerned with the attempt to control pollution and the depletion of natural resources within a framework of sustainable development [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The resource management and pollution control components which comprise this framework make it inherently linked to public health objectives, despite there being no explicit mention of human health in many IEL statutes [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
