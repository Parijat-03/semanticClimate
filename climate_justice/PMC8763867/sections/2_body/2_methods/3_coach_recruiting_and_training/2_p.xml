At the beginning of this training, the facilitators introduced the objectives and the target audience for the workshop and then reviewed the schedule for the small groups. Each coach next shared their own story of self for 2 minutes and was coached by another coach for 3 minutes using the coaching tips and worksheet in the story of self small-group guide (<xref rid="s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix E</xref>, pages 5&#8211;6). The full group then offered feedback on the coaching. We rotated roles until everyone had had an opportunity to share their story and to coach. During the coaching feedback, we placed specific emphasis on ensuring that the coaches employed tactics that were positive and supportive to encourage engagement without making the participant feel forced to share information they were uncomfortable sharing. This training took approximately 90 minutes.</p>
