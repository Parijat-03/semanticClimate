<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">QUB provides great support for student-led initiatives and scored very highly in this metric compared to other medical schools (<xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), but there is plenty of opportunity for greater involvement and funding for planetary health initiatives. For example, the SMDBS has a well-established and popular funded summer studentship scheme which would be an ideal opportunity for interested students to get involved in research related to either global or planetary health or investigating ways to improve sustainability within healthcare. The Student&#8217;s Union also provides great support for such initiatives, by funding societies like Students for Global Health, and are partnered with other groups such as Green at Queen&#8217;s, so students with an interest in this topic have various extracurricular activities to choose from during their time at university.</p>
