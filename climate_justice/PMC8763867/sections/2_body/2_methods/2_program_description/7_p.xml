The facilitators assigned participants to small groups in advance and ensured diversity within the groups. In the groups, the coach began by sharing their own story of self and then gave all of the participants 5 minutes to brainstorm using the worksheet provided (<xref rid="s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix E</xref>, page 4). Each participant then shared their story and received coaching on how to improve. At the end of the small-group session, each coach identified one member of their group to share their story in front of the large group when the full group reconvened. Finally, the facilitators led a large-group debrief soliciting feedback from the participants on highlights from the workshop and things that could be improved. They also asked participants how they imagined employing these skills in their work and gauged their interest in further training.</p>
