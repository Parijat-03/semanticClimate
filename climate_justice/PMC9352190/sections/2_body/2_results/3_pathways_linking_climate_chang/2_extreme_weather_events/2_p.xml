<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0008">One of the major impacts of climate change is the increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events in different regions of the world. Examples of these are droughts, storms, flooding, and heatwaves. These abrupt yet catastrophic phenomena create massive disruptions in various aspects of communities. In the case of HIV/AIDS, there are at least three main aspects where disruptions can be anticipated, which can have grave consequences for communities affected by HIV/AIDS. First, such extreme events affect food production, either by inundating agricultural lands or lowering soil moisture, which then diminishes crop yield eventually leading to food insecurity <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsaa008" id="interref0004">[</ext-link>

Reduced access to a steady supply of nutritious food is detrimental to overall physical and mental health. Malnutrition leads to a compromised immunological system, which then would result in increased susceptibility to infections among already immunocompromised patients living with HIV <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
