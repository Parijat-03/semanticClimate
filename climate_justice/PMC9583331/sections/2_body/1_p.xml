<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The theme of this year&#8217;s International Open Access Week
is &#8216;Open for Climate Justice&#8217;. This reminds us that
chemistry will be instrumental in solving one of humankind&#8217;s
most urgent and pressing existential challenges. But for the researcher
to provide the greatest impact, we must facilitate greater access
to, and transparency of, the scientific enterprise. From open access
publications to open data to preprints and transparent peer review,
every step we take toward transparency and visibility builds ever
more robust scientific literature and knowledge. The success of ACS
Publications&#8217; open access portfolio of <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://acsopenscience.org/open-access-journals/">12 journals</ext-link> reflects the global chemistry community&#8217;s support of open
access. <italic>ACS Omega</italic> alone has published almost 16,000
articles with nearly 22 million downloads to date, growing appreciably
in its published content and influence since its launch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> In June 2022, we were proud to receive more evidence of the journal&#8217;s
impressive performance when we learned that <italic>ACS Omega</italic> achieved an Impact Factor of 4.132, a CiteScore of 5.2, and a 5-Year
Impact Factor of 4.197. In addition, <italic>ACS Omega</italic> articles
were cited 41,528 times in 2021.</p>
