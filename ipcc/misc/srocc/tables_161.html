      <td>Climate variability and extreme climatic events such as severe drought, especially those associated with the El Ni&#241;o Southern\nOscillation (ENSO), play a major role in fire upsurges, as in equatorial Asia (Huijnen et al. 2016). Fire emissions in tropical forests\nincreased by 133% on average during and following six El Ni&#241;o years compared to six La Ni&#241;a years during 1997&#8211;2016, due to\nreductions in precipitation and terrestrial water storage (Chen et al. 2017). The expansion of agriculture and deforestation in the humid\ntropics has also made these regions more vulnerable to drought-driven fires (Davidson et al. 2012; Brando et al. 2014). Even when\ndeforestation rates were overall declining, as in the Brazilian Amazon during 2003&#8211;2015, the incidence of fire increased by 36%\nduring the drought of 2015 (Arag&#227;o et al. 2018).</td>

GFED4s has updated fire-related carbon emission estimates biome-wise (regionally and globally), using higher resolution\ninput data gridded at 0.25&#730;, a new burned area dataset with small fires, improved fire emission factors (Akagi et al. 2011; Urbanski\n2014) and better fire severity characterisation of boreal forests (van der Werf et al. 2017). The estimates for the period 1997&#8211;2016 are\n2.2 GtC yr&#8211;1, being highest in the 1997 El Nino (3.0 GtC yr&#8211;1) and lowest in 2013 (1.8 GtC yr&#8211;1). Furthermore, fire emissions during\n1997&#8211;2016 were dominated by savanna (65.3%), followed by tropical forest (15.1%), boreal forest (7.4%), temperate forest (2.3%),\npeatland (3.7%) and agricultural waste burning (6.3%) (van der Werf et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>Fires not only transfer carbon from land to the atmosphere but also between different terrestrial pools: from live to dead biomass\nto soil, including partially charred biomass, charcoal and soot constituting 0.12&#8211;0.39 GtC yr&#8211;1 or 0.2&#8211;0.6% of annual terrestrial NPP\n(Doerr and Sant&#237;n 2016). Carbon from the atmosphere is sequestered back into regrowing vegetation at rates specific to the type of\nvegetation and other environmental variables (Loehman et al. 2014). Fire emissions are thus not necessarily a net source of carbon\ninto the atmosphere, as post-fire recovery of vegetation can sequester a roughly equivalent amount back into biomass over a time\nperiod of one to a few years (in grasslands and agricultural lands) to decades (in forests) (Landry and Matthews 2016). Fires from\ndeforestation (for land use change) and on peatlands (which store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation) obviously are a net\nsource of carbon from the land to the atmosphere (Turetsky et al. 2014); these types of fires were estimated to emit 0.4 GtC yr&#8211;1\nin recent decades (van der Werf et al. 2017). Peatland fires dominated by smouldering combustion under low temperatures and\nhigh moisture conditions can burn for long periods (Turetsky et al. 2014).</td>

Fires cause soil erosion through action of wind and water (Moody et al. 2013) thus resulting in land degradation (Chapter 4)\nand eventually desertification (Chapter 3). Fires also affect carbon exchange between land and atmosphere through ozone (which\nretards photosynthesis) and aerosol (which slightly increases diffuse radiation) emissions. The net effect from fire on global GPP during\n2002&#8211;2011 is estimated to be &#8211;0.86 &#177; 0.74 GtC yr&#8211;1 (Yue and Unger 2018).</td>

The risk of wildfires in future could be expected to change, increasing significantly in North America, South America, central Asia,\nsouthern Europe, southern Africa and Australia (Liu et al. 2010). There is emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland\nfires are being driven by changing weather extremes, thereby signalling geographical shifts in fire proneness (Jolly et al. 2015). Fire\nweather season has already lengthened by 18.7% globally between 1979 and 2013, with statistically significant increases across\n25.3% but decreases only across 10.7% of Earth&#8217;s land surface covered with vegetation. Even sharper changes have been observed\nduring the second half of this period (Jolly et al. 2015).
