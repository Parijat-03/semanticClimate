# WHAT IS CHAPTER 08 ABOUT?

* Urban system and other settlements (cities)

# WHAT IS URBANIZATION?

Urbanization refers to the process by which an increasing proportion of a population moves from rural areas to urban areas, leading to the growth and expansion of cities and towns.

# SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER

- Urbanization offers a chance to improve resource efficiency and reduce carbon emissions globally.(8.1.4)
- Per capita urban carbon emissions vary but tend to be lower than national emissions.(8.3.3)
- Developing countries may experience increased emissions due to infrastructure development and changing lifestyles.(8.1.4)
- Urban areas contribute significantly to the global carbon footprint.
- Future urban greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase, but the extent depends on mitigation efforts.(8.3.4)
- Urban land expansion can impact carbon stocks, emphasizing the need for low-carbon urban development.
- Construction and upgrading of urban infrastructure will contribute significantly to emissions.(8.4.1)
- Building and upgrading cities in the usual way creates a lot of pollution, like CO2 emissions. This harms the environment and makes climate change worse.(8.4.1)
- Pollution could be really high by 2030 and we'll need double the materials for construction by 2050.
- We should reduce pollution within and beyond cities.
- Smart planning can make a big difference:(8.4)

      * Build closer together (efficient land use)
      * Use greener transportation
      * Planting more trees and creating green spaces

- Green spaces help by:(8.4.4)

       * Storing carbon
       * Making cities cooler
       * Improving health

- Different cities need different solutions depending on how they're built and how fast they're growing.
- Existing cities can make changes like renovating buildings, using cleaner transportation, and making neighbourhood’s more compact.
- We should also help informal settlements become better and more environmentally friendly.
- To make all of this happen, governments, organizations, and people need to work together. We need money and support to make our cities cleaner and safer for everyone.
