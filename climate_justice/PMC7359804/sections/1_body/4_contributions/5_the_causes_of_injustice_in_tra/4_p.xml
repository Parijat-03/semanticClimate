<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Smeds et al.'s (2020)</xref> paper complements Barber's analysis. They use <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Young's (1990)</xref> politics of difference to analyse the politics of nightlife mobilities in London, and how their differential formation is constructed, negotiated, recognised, or excluded in policy making. Criticising the traditional framing of difference in fixed categories of race, gender and economic status, and advocating for a feminist and intersectional understanding of mobile subjects (as in <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Sheller, 2018b</xref>), the authors show how vulnerable groups are made invisible in London's night-time mobilities, which are designed solely around the needs of the most economically productive social groups.</p>
