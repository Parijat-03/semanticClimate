<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our findings underscore the importance of cultivating work that looks at the climate change&#8211;mental health nexus using group-level initiatives which have the co-benefit of strengthening community-based responses to climate change and improving mental wellbeing [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consolidating this knowledge can assist in the identification of strategies that can effectively help to reduce mental health risks, offer upstream attention to the causes of harm, and build resilience in children and youth through integrating them into existing community networks, services and programs [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to initiate novel research strategies and strengthen existing intersectoral collaborations between the health sector and those jurisdictions responsible for climate education, adaptation, and mitigation. Although interventions and research may be site specific, the knowledge collected in the process of this work can be fed directly back into improving the health and wellbeing of children and youth across Canada, and around the world.</p>
