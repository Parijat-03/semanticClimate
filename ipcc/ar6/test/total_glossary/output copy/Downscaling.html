<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A method that derives local- to regional-scale information from larger-scale models or data analyses.</p>
<p>Two main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods are based on observations and develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/regional climate variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on the quality of the downscaled information. The two methods can be combined, for example, applying empirical/statistical downscaling to the output of a regional climate model, consisting of a dynamical downscaling of a global climate model.</p>
