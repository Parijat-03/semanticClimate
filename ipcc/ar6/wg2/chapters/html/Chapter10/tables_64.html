      <td>Losses and damages are climate impacts after implementing adaptation and mitigation actions, signifying the presence of residual risks\n(Chapter 1; Kugler and Sariego, 2016; Mechler et al., 2019). These residual risks indicate that despite adaptation, there are soft and\nhard adaptation limits (Mechler et al., 2019). This box reviews the adaptation literature across 51 countries in Asia on loss and damage\n(L&amp;D), and adaptation barriers and limits, and identifies knowledge and regional gaps. The key messages are that (a) climate-induced\nL&amp;D is already occurring across Asia (medium evidence, high agreement), (b) these L&amp;D are very likely to increase at higher warming\nlevels (medium evidence, high agreement) and (c) measuring and attributing non-economic and intangible L&amp;D remains a challenge (low\nevidence, high agreement).</td>

      <td>Findings on losses and damages in Asia: Evidence on climate-related L&amp;D highlights tangible or material losses and damages such\nas loss to life, property, infrastructure and livelihoods (medium evidence, high agreement); and intangible or non-material losses and\ndamages such as increasing conflict and civil unrest, erosion of sociocultural practices and decreased well-being (low evidence, high\nagreement). The main constraint in assessing past and future L&amp;D is that this terminology is not used prominently or consistently in the\ndisaster management and climate risk literature in Asia, which potentially leads to under-reporting. In contrast, there is robust evidence\n(high agreement) on adaptation constraints, notably on governance, informational and physical constraints, to adapting, but regional\nevidence is very uneven with gaps in Central, North and West Asia. Table 10.5 presents a summary of L&amp;D but draws on national and\nsubnational studies.</td>

In addition to vulnerability assessments, assessing L&amp;D and limits\nto adaptation can inform adaptation prioritisation and enhance adaptation effectiveness (e.g., Craft and Fisher, 2016; Leiter et al., 2019).\nLessons are available from biodiversity and ecosystem services monitoring frameworks that have well-developed metrics and processes\n(e.g., D&#237;az et al., 2020).</td>
