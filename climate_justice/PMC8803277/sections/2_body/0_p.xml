Expectations were at an all-time high as this negotiation was widely seen to be the last best chance for governments to come to an agreement that would hold global temperature increases to 1.5&#176;&#160;Celsius in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement. In an effort to ensure that the Paris Agreement&#8217;s commitment for a &#8220;right to health&#8221; would be meaningfully implemented in the pact, the World Health Organization-hosted Pavilion saw 10 days of presentations and discussions dedicated to placing health and equity &#8220;at the centre of climate negotiations&#8221; (World Health Organization [WHO], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>; p.VIII).</p>
