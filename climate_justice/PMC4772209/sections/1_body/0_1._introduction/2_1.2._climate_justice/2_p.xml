Bulkeley <italic>et al.</italic> organized distributive justice as the rights and responsibilities of individuals, organizations, and governments within the larger climate justice scene as differentially distributed across space and time (e.g., who is responsible for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and on what time scale should the mitigation be addressed); whereas procedural justice is the inclusion and participation, equitably, of all affected parties (e.g., explicitly determining who should take responsibility for decision making over mitigation policy, how, and for whom is it being done because all parties involved have rights that need to be respected through acknowledgement and voluntary participation) [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fraser also presented a third type, &#8220;recognition justice,&#8221; where rights and differences of cultural and social groups are recognized and addressed [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this regard, recognition justice calls for the affirmation of difference&#8212;based on race, gender, class, and even geography&#8212;to overcome obstacles for any subset of the population to be involved in responding to an issue [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This review frames climate justice within the Southeastern U.S. in respect to recognition justice. </p>
