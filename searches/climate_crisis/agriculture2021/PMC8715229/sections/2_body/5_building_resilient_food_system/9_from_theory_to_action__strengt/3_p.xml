<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0565">With regard to food systems, early warning systems and monitoring capacities need to be strengthened and further integrated so that emerging biophysical and economic risks and vulnerabilities can be rapidly identified and guide appropriate interventions. Many countries and regions had to confront the pandemic while having to manage multiple other shocks. As previously discussed, the impact of the pandemic on global food security during 2020 was partially buffered by robust global food supply. This was a lucky coincidence. Teleconnections in the climate system, such as those for example linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation events, can lead to adverse climatic conditions across multiple regions, which would further compound the impacts on food security of pandemics like COVID-19. Early warning systems, institutional preparedness and international cooperation need to be strengthened with respect to managing multiple and diverse risks to food systems from the local to global scale. Given the complexity and teleconnections embedded in modern food systems, improved capacities for international governance, strengthened international organizations (e.g., WHO, UNEP, WTO, and bi- and multilateral development cooperation) are desirable and necessary. As we have come to understand the global footprint of human activities, a stronger integration of the natural and social sciences is needed to evaluate the interplay between the biophysical constraints and economic incentive structures and behavioral mechanisms driving the evolution of the food system.</p>
