The role of adaptation then is to support the transformative processes needed to move from a poorly performing system and inequitable system to one that generates higher and more stable welfare for poor people, better nutrition for both rich and poor, and better environmental outcomes (Few et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). For example, a livelihood diversification project that reduces women&#8217;s vulnerability to climate change could be termed a transformative adaptation activity if it also triggers a sustained shift in gender relations, gender agency and empowerment of women&#8221; (Few et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). In a review of 80 studies, Fedele et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>) find that &#8220;transformative adaptation is characterized as being restructuring, path-shifting, innovative, multiscale, systemwide, and persistent&#8221;. They conclude that if policy makers and practitioners supported and implemented transformative adaptation to address real or potential changes triggered by climate change, they would efficiently and sustainably develop and be able to anticipate or recover from climate change impact.</p>
