There is an urgent need for better theoretical approaches and differently focused empirical studies that put the needs of the poor first in analyzing and advocating for effective governance responses to planetary ecological crises and earth system transformations. Inspired by Gandhi's Talisman (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Austin, 2003</xref>, vii), we argue that this requires powerful state and non-state actors across all scales of governance to abide by the following three tenets of pro-poor planetary justice:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0025">That the poor and marginalized majority shall not be made worse off;</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0030">That the lot of the poor must improve;</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p id="p0035">That the poor be recognized as legitimate participants (whether directly or via representation) in decisions about planetary stewardship.</p></list-item></list>
