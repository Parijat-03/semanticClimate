While McCormick et al. found that cases in which health was an issue had a win rate nearly the same as that for non-health cases (31% and 30%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], claims made by litigants attested to the perceived power of health risk attributions in legal argumentation. As stated, many litigants were &#8220;motivated to include health allegations in climate cases because they make the consequences of unabated climate change tangible and may increase the chances that courts will grant the relief sought by satisfying the substantive criteria needed to achieve success on the legal merits of the claim&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Additionally, McCormick et al. noted that several cases in the database that centered on claims about contaminated water and used health as a central argument were won by plaintiffs seeking improved protections for local communities [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p>
