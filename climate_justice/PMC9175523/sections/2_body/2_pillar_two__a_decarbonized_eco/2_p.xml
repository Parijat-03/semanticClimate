In the longer-term, radical alternatives such as steady-state economies, or economics of de-growth will have to be considered. These radical alternatives would not be realizable in the short-medium term without unprecedented socio-political disruption. Our immediate priority is to decarbonize the global economy. There are immediate fixes available. For example, the inclusion of a wider range of indicators in basic macroeconomic accounting would serve to broaden economic debate beyond perennial GDP and employment fixations (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). The Project Drawdown report, published in 2017, describes the 100 most substantive solutions to the climate crisis, for which the technology already exists. Solutions include better refrigerant management (potential to reduce 57.75 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>-e over 2020&#8211;2050) and better health and education provision for women and girls (potential to reduce 85.42 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>-e over 2020&#8211;2050) (Hawken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>).</p>
