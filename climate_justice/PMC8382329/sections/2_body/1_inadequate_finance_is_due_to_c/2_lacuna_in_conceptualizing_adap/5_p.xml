The climate regime reflects more of this philosophy under the principle of equity and differentiated responsibility based on respective capability (Article 3.1 of the Convention), but &#8220;constructed ambiguity&#8221; is used as a strategic resource by those with power (Best <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). The opposition to the polluter-pays-principle and the spatial disconnect between the main causers and sufferers, explain Gardiner&#8217;s &#8220;theoretical ineptitude&#8221; and moral storms around climate vulnerability and adaptation. We now turn to reconceptualizing adaptation, to correct these lacunae.</p>
