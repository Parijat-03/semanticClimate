<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The South American monsoon (SAmerM) is a regional circulation characterized by inflow of low-level winds from the Atlantic to South America, including Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and northern Argentina, associated with the development of surface pressure gradients (and intense precipitation) during austral summer (DecemberâJanuaryâFebruary).</p>
<p>During SeptemberâOctoberâNovember, areas of intense convection migrate from northwestern South America to the south. Associated with this regime, an upper-tropospheric anticyclone (a.k.a. the Bolivian High) forms over the Altiplano region during the monsoon onset. The SAmerM then retreats during MarchâAprilâMay with a northeastward migration of the convection. Further details on how SAmerM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p>
