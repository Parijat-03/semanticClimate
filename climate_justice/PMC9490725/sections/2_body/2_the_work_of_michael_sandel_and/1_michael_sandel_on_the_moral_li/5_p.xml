Regarding the former, he makes a distinction between a fine (e.g. set limits and fine companies that exceed them) and a fee (buying pollution permits or paying a tax): &#8220;The second approach says in effect that emitting pollution is not like littering but simply a cost of doing business. But is that right? Or should some moral stigma attach to companies that spew excessive pollution into the air?&#8221; (Sandel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012a</xref>: 72). He writes that &#8220;a tax on emissions can be seen as a fee rather than a fine; but if it&#8217;s big enough, it has the virtue of making the polluters pay for the damage they inflict. Precisely for this reason, it is politically difficult to enact&#8221; (76).</p>
