<disp-quote><p>Flavia has not missed a single session of Polis&#8217;s Citizenship School.
Since the start of the pandemic, she felt isolated in her struggles for
the right to the city, and overwhelmed by the political neglect with
which they are ignored. Fighting isolation, she has become active on
social media platforms, where she engages in discussions initiated by
the school that resonate with her. In the process and inadvertently, she
is expanding the learning process beyond the school, allowing her &#8220;aha&#8221;
moments and reflections to reverberate with a far wider community.</p></disp-quote>
