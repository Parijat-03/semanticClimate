It allows for a politicized and historicized analysis of social processes, the evolution of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and social class relations, and a scrutiny of terminologies such as &#8216;vulnerability&#8217; and &#8216;scarcity&#8217; (following Ribot, <xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Scoones et al., <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In our definition, climate change politics can be crudely categorized as progressive or regressive. By progressive climate change politics we mean &#8216;those social dynamics that shape the meanings of climate change, its causes and consequences, how it can be addressed, by whom, where and when in ways that advance &#8220;agrarian justice&#8221; and &#8220;climate justice&#8221;, separately and together&#8217; (Borras et al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, p. 2).<xref rid="EN0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> By regressive climate change politics we refer to &#8216;social and political processes that block, undermine or reverse advocacy for or gains in progressive climate change politics&#8217; (Borras et al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, p. 2).</p>
