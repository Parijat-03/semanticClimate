Climate change is already evident through physical climatic data taken over the last half century, and impacts have been documented and are expected to continue, if not worsen. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-13-00189-t001">Table 1</xref> outlines four major subsets of climate change: temperature, precipitation, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The evidence of climate change presented is specific to the Southeastern U.S., and projected climate change effects for both urban and rural Southeastern populations from the literature are identified. Literature often emphasizes the impacts of climate change in relation to large urban centers in developed countries, such as the U.S., and overlooks surrounding populations of rural communities in these same countries. </p>
