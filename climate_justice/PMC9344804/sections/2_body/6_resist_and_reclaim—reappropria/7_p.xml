On June&#160;10, 2018, the committee organized a&#160;&#8220;Protest March for the Dignity of the City.&#8221; The protest turned into a&#160;substantial campaign, bringing together more than 70&#160;urban committees, associations, trade unions, parties, and individual citizens. On their banners, participants called for an urban policy focused on the needs of the city&#8217;s inhabitants. They demanded plans for an authentic, inhabitable city, highlighting the need to reclaim Venice&#8217;s &#8220;streets and squares&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn100">100</xref>. In June 2020, during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a&#160;demonstration with the slogan &#8220;<italic>Venezia FuTuristica</italic>&#8221; (&#8220;was touristic&#8221; as well as &#8220;futuristic&#8221;) yet again pointed out the subordination of politics to industrial interests. At the same time, however, they used this moment, with its conspicuous absence of tourists, to raise questions about the post-pandemic development. By creating a&#160;human chain embracing the city, the protesters once again used their bodily presence to communicate their vision for a&#160;sustainable urban future.</p>
