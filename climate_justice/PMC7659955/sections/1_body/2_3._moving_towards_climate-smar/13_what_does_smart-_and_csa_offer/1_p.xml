According to Azevedo [<xref rid="B5-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], there is a big chance that CSA will empower and strengthen the conceptualization and execution of smart village in different ways. Safdar and Heap [<xref rid="B89-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] noted that development of small grids to power certain climate-smart technologies has so far spurred a re-imagination of the possibility of home solar powering in many Indian villages. Items such as solar lanterns, and street solar lighting systems have become very popular. Nevertheless, a new concern is the way to enhance local productions and repairs of these materials, in order to cater for higher tariffs of importing them to interior villages, and shipping them back for repairs, when the items develop technical faults. The report also stressed how CSA has so far upheld gender equality, for instance, the CCAFS project in Kenya&#8217;s Nyando valley has mostly favored women whose incomes have improved due to new technology for growing their vegetables [<xref rid="B13-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
