Voting is relatively simple (except in a pandemic during the 2020 US election). Hypothetically, it should take you no more than an hour to get to your polling place, stand in line, and cast your ballot, and you do not have to do it again for 2 years. Even then, only 60% of eligible voters voted in the 2016 election and 50% voted in the 2018 election (United States Election Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). An educational campaign to get people to eat less meat, live in smaller houses, or drive less would have to be mounted at the scale of a presidential campaign to get a fraction of that voting participation, and these consumer choices are far more difficult than voting.</p>
