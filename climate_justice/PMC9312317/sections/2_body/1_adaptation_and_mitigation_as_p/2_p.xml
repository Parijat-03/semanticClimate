In terms of temporality, mitigation requires a story that it is not yet too late to prevent &#8216;runaway climate change&#8217;, whereas adaptation emphasizes that (some) impacts of climate change can no longer be avoided. While these narratives are not unreconcilable, in practice, they often conflict because talking about adaptation is considered fatalistic (de Moor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>). Furthermore, in terms of prognosis, mitigation demands radical social change, by shifting away from a fossil-fuel-based economy or even from the dominant economic growth paradigm (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>), whereas mainstream approaches to adaptation have been depicted as a conservative project to increase the resilience of the status quo (Bassett and Fogelman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>; Hodson and Marvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). For instance, critics have pointed out that adaptation has often prioritized protecting prestigious projects and zones of economic importance over vulnerable communities (Hodson and Marvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>; Anguelovski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). Climate activists in particular have furthermore described adaptation as a techno-optimistic excuse not to take the radical measures needed in order to mitigate climate change (Simonet and Fatori&#263; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>; Remling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>; de Moor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>).</p>
