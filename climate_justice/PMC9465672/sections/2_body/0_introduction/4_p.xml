These climate-related forced migrants were mainly associated with inhabitants of Small Islands Developing States (e.g., Farbotko &amp; Lazrus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Bellard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>;&#160;Andr&#233;fou&#235;t et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>; Eckersley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>: 482;&#160;). However, the concept remains strongly questioned in development theories and policy narratives (e.g., Black, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Hartmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>; Farbotko &amp; Lazrus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>) and has no legal status yet (e.g., Berchin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Thus, in the highly politicized arena of climate change, there is no normative protection from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the kind of forced migrants who are not running from political persecution but from environmental distress (Farbotko &amp; Lazrus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Berchin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>).</p>
