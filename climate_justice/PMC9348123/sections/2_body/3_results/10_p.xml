In the children's networks, most key players are highly concentrated in the central part of the circle. Some key players, such as Azra Ghani (F1), Justin Trudeau (P2), Azra Ghani (P3), and Amalina (D1), relatively have some distances from other key players. In the teens' networks, people show relatively dispersed patterns. Overall, key players are located in the central part of the networks. In the adults' networks, nodes are highly concentrated in some parts, and key players show the most dispersed locations among all networks. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (I1), HHS.gov (I3), and JAMA (J2) are placed in the central part of the networks. In the elderly's networks, nodes show a large circle, and most key players are located in the large networks. Some key players, such as Donald Trump (P3) and Zaeem Zia (R2), play an important role in outer networks of the circle.</p>
