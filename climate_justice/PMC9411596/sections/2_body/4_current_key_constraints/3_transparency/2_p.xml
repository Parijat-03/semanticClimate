To a large extent, this is driven by a desire on the part of third-party service providers to commoditise the provision of CRAs for financial disclosure. This is a problem because it obscures the ability to evaluate and compare methodologies and it does not support knowledge diffusion. The lack of common principles, and the limited regulation of providers of such climate services, further compounds the problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the humanitarian context, data and modelling approaches are generally open-source by default but the same lack of commonly accepted principles exists, making it difficult to compare assessments completed in different regions and to evaluate, integrate and scale up solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In all sectors, the inherent and unavoidable uncertainty in climate risk demands full transparency in the assumptions, models and data used in the assessments. Particular care must be taken to avoid over-simplifications and &#8220;singular and definitive&#8221; statements that can lead to maladaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> when the reality is &#8220;plural and conditional&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
