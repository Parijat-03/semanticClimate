<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In its current form, the PCS lasts for five days, is implemented twice a year in May and November and focuses on the climate crisis and related topics such as biodiversity loss [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], climate justice (i.e., attitudes and actions supporting the just division and fair distribution of benefits and burdens of and responsibilities to tackle climate change) [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], climate communication [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], economic impact of the climate crisis [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], visions of a sustainable future [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or climate and arts [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on prior work suggesting positive effects of tailoring strategies on intervention effectiveness [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the PCS is tailored to local needs at two levels. At the level of classes, teachers decide autonomously which intervention components they take part in. At the level of intervention components, complementing the highly standardised live lessons delivered centrally by the implementation team, the challenges of the day, workshops and peer exchange sessions are tailored to local students&#8217; needs. </p>
