Using the idea of governmobility (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">B&#230;renholdt, 2013</xref>), and a participatory survey looking at perceptions of walkability, Barbers shows how mobile subjects participate in the making of uneven mobilities via the internalization of mobilities' techniques of government.</p>
