Although Venice dominates media representations concerning the destructive impact of cruise ships, it can stand in for the situation in several other port cities in the Adriatic and Mediterranean. Local debates tend to focus on future routes and passenger terminals, hence on the infrastructures of the cruise industry which transform and shape the natural environment, urban space, and everyday life. The example of Venice shows that the cruise industry, and the maritime economy more broadly, unbalance spatial orders and urban practices (Schemmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). This article argues that the cruise ship symbolizes this mechanism. In my contribution, I&#160;will approach the issue by analyzing the spatialization of the industry through its infrastructures, its spatial effects, and through the ways inhabitants interact with them.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> The article examines the ways in which the <italic>Comitato No Grandi Navi</italic> engages with the cruise industry and its infrastructures to counter the spatialization of the sector. I&#160;will show how the network acquires counter- and extra-expertise and shares, spreads, and applies its spatial knowledge to reappropriate space and reclaim a&#160;say in the process.</p>
