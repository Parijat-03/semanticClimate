Santal women generally demonstrated stronger voice in decisionmaking than ethnic Bengali women, though of course there is variation among both groups. Santal women emphasised that they lead discussions with spouses and their aim is to secure agreement with their objectives. They first discuss new technologies with agricultural experts from the RDRS and the Kalipara Union Federation. They then talk to their husband. For instance, selection and purchase of improved wheat seed &#8220;is decided by a woman after discussing the matter with her husband&#8221;. A woman also &#8220;discusses with her husband to decide about how much fertiliser is to be used where on the farm&#8221;.</p>
