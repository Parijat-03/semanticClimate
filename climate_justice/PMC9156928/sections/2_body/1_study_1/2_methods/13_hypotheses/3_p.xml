For example, some participants may have concluded from the material we showed that policy elites are unreliable, given the general failure of UN and governmental policy over 30 years. Others might have felt more faith in institutions when they saw how the Sunrise movement boosted congressional action. We therefore maintained neutral expectations for how this factor may change and how this variation could affect participation.
