In Australia, total energy consumption increased by 44.5% from 56,651 ktoe (kilotons of oil equivalent) to 81,843 ktoe between 1990 and 2017 (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). However, the country&#8217;s energy production increased by 47.5% from 86,139 to 127,032 ktoe in the same period (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Therefore, Australia is one of the few members in the OECD that is an energy exporter (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). In 2015, the country was the leading coal exporter and second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter in the world (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p>
