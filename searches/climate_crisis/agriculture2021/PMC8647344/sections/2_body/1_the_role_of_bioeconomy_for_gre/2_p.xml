This direction reinstates the circular bioeconomy and biobased products and services on the cornerstone of strategic decision making. This trend has been long pursued by the US Biopreferred program to spur economic development, create new jobs and provide new markets for farm commodities. The Program was designed by the 2002 Farm Bill and reauthorized and expanded as part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2021</xref>). Just a couple of months before the COVID 19 outbreak, the European Union announced the European Green Deal's for a climate-neutral economy by 2050 (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">EC, 2019</xref>), which also acknowledges the shift from a linear bioeconomy to a circular bioeconomy and promotes changes in policy frames. China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea also announced similar climate-neutral economy plans within 2020 (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Schiermacher, 2020</xref>). The US's new administration has also declared its intention to rejoin the Paris climate agreement immediately after the 2020 presidential election (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Newburger, 2020</xref>).</p>
