For the case of load-following power production in nuclear power, it is equipped in the higher power sized plant which is operated recently (NEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Hence, it is considered a negative effect on the plant operations, because it is not able to treat the load-following demand due to the neurotic characteristics of the system. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the simplified modeling for NPP load-following for supply&#8211;demand (Rodica et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) in which the NPP cost, lifetime, budget, and power volume are incorporated. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and net present value (NPV) of NPP are obtained, which shows the economic effects of the load-following operations of the plant.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Simplified modeling for NPP load-following for supply&#8211;demand</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10668_2022_2551_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
