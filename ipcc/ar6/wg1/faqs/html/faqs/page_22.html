Examples include changes in global surface temperature, Arctic sea ice cover, and global average sea level. However, over a&#160;period as short as twenty years, these trends are substantially influenced by natural climate variability, which can either amplify or attenuate the trend expected from the further increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.</span></div><div left="68.74" right="539.58" top="600.22"><span x0="68.74" y0="600.22" x1="539.58" style="x0: 68.74; x1: 73.74; y0: 600.22; y1: 609.22; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Twenty years are a&#160;long time by human standards but a&#160;short time from a&#160;climate point of view. Emissions of greenhouse gases will continue over the next twenty years, as assumed in all the scenarios considered in this Report, albeit with varying rates. These emissions will further increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (see FAQ 4.2), leading to continued trends in global surface warming and other parts of the climate system, including Arctic sea ice and global average sea level (see FAQ 9.2). FAQ 4.1, Figure&#160;1 shows that both global surface temperature rise and the shrinking of sea ice in the Arctic will continue, with little difference between high- and low-emissions scenarios over the next 20 years (that is, between the red and blue lines).</span></div><div left="68.74" right="539.56" top="510.24"><span x0="68.74" y0="510.24" x1="539.56" style="x0: 68.74; x1: 75.24; y0: 510.24; y1: 519.24; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">However, these expected trends will be overlain by natural climate variability (see FAQ 3.2). First, a&#160;major volcanic eruption might occur, such as the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on the Philippines; such an eruption might cause a&#160;global surface cooling of a&#160;few tenths of a&#160;degree Celsius lasting several years. Second, both atmosphere and ocean show variations that occur spontaneously, without any external influence. These variations range from localized weather systems to continent- and ocean-wide patterns and oscillations that change over months, years, or decades. Over a&#160;period of twenty years, natural climate variability strongly influences many climate quantities, when compared to the response to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities. The&#160;effect of natural variability is illustrated by the very different trajectories that individual black, red or blue lines can take in FAQ 4.1, Figure&#160;1. Whether natural variability would amplify or attenuate the human influence cannot generally be predicted out to twenty years into the future. Natural climate variability over the next twenty years thus constitutes an uncertainty that at best can be quantified accurately but that cannot be reduced.</span></div><div left="68.74" right="539.53" top="372.27"><span x0="68.74" y0="372.27" x1="539.53" style="x0: 68.74; x1: 73.24; y0: 372.27; y1: 381.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Locally, the effect of natural variability would be much larger still. Simulations (not shown here) indicate that, locally, a&#160;cooling trend over the next twenty years cannot be ruled out, even under the high-emissions scenario&#160;&#8211; at a&#160;small number of locations on Earth, but these might lie anywhere. Globally, though, temperatures would rise under all scenarios.</span></div><div left="68.74" right="539.54" top="318.28"><span x0="68.74" y0="318.28" x1="539.54" style="x0: 68.74; x1: 71.24; y0: 318.28; y1: 327.28; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In summary, while the direction of future change is clear for the two important climate quantities shown here &#8211; the global surface temperature and the Arctic sea ice area in September &#8211; the magnitude of the change is much less clear because of natural variability.</span></div></body></html>
