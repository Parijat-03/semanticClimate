First, parcels in neighborhoods with more Latina/x/o residents had higher climate change-attributed impacts. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> uses descriptive statistics where we multiply the number of parcels in three categories (i.e., not flooded, flooded because of climate change, would have flooded even without climate change) with the proportion of different racial groups in each neighborhood to provide a schematic to illustrate the racial disparities in flood depths for the 38% scenario. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> uses descriptive statistics (in the same manner as Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) to show these disparities for damages, with the per capita damages for a Latina/x/o person from climate change-attributed flooding estimated at ~$1,035. Although this estimate is only narrowly higher than that for whites ($828), it should be noted that home values are higher in white neighborhoods, and therefore this disparity per unit of home value is greater<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Percent of properties associated with each racial and ethnic group (38% scenario).</title><p>Estimated percentages for residential properties in Harris County, Texas during Hurricane Harvey.
