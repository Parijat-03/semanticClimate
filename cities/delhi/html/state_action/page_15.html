As a developing mega city each citizen has to contribute to ensure that adverse impacts of global warming are controlled and mitigated by taking measures which help to reduce Greenhouse Gases.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.14" top="645.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="645.72" x1="508.14" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 645.72; y1: 656.76; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC clearly brings out the actions necessary as outlined in the NAPCC and creates a framework for implementing a series of actions by different departments of the Government of Delhi. Government of Delhi has been leading the clean and sustainable development in number of sectors. We have taken strong measures such as Odd and Even Scheme, massive tree planatation, prevention of biomass and garbage burning, greening of public spaces, ban on BSLV III engines and implementing policy to ensure that only eco-friendly BSLV IV engines are manufacturd, implementing Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, and ban on plying 15 years or more old commercial/transport vehicles etc. During 2016-17 a total of 8.72 Lakh sapling and 12.31 Lakh shrubs had been planted by the Forest Department alongwith other greening agencies. During 2017-18, about 5.5 lakh saplings and 7.93 lakh shrubs have already been planted till December, 2017. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.11" top="485.61"><span x0="72.02" y0="485.61" x1="508.11" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 485.61; y1: 496.65; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The report highlights the activities already being done by the Government of Delhi to achieve those ends and the measures that need to be taken in the future. It is action at the ground which makes all the difference in achieving our goals. Every citizen has a role to contribute.  Development &amp; Sustainability should go hand in hand. With involvement of civil societies, Government Departments &amp; common people, we need to work together to address the needs of development, meet the aspirations of the people and addresses the concerns of our planet. It is the right time to incorporate the concerns of climate change in our development agenda and Delhi SAPCC attempts to do that. With the citizens cooperation it is possible to address all the issues comprehensively. I hope this document will be read and discussed by all civil society groups and within the government for its successful implementation. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.99" top="325.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="325.63" x1="507.99" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 82.45; y0: 325.63; y1: 336.67; width: 10.42; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">While engaging with national policies and programmes, it is important for us to develop well researched and formulated mitigation and adaptation strategies specific to the Delhi to respond effectively to the possible impacts of Climate Change. To address the changing climatic conditions SAPCC has been developed by the Government of NCT of Delhi. The SAPCC has flagged important issues which require attention. The action plan has highlighted key sectoral concerns and strategies for action in order to lead the way.  </span></div></body></html>
