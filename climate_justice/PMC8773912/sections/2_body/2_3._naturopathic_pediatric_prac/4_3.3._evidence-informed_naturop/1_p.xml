<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In close collaboration with the family, NDs develop a plan that takes into account a holistic evaluation of the patient; available evidence for safety, efficacy, and interactions of conventional and complementary management strategies; and the family&#8217;s values and preferences in order to develop an individualized plan. Given the potential range of approaches that an ND may recommend, it is the duty of the clinician, as it is for all healthcare providers, to present these options to the child and their family in a way that enables true informed consent. This conversation requires discussion of the risks and benefits of each option, including what would be considered the conventional standard of care, and the natural progression if left unaddressed. </p>
