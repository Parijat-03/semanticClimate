Angela Roothaan notes that Indigenous peoples focus on &#8220;how the spirits tell them to maintain an environmental balance with specific local surroundings, out of respect and love for the actual living beings that make up those surroundings, on which human life depends, and which human life can help sustain.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> One approach to addressing this gap is to ensure that UN human rights treaties are read alongside other UN treaties. For example, although still framed as important for meeting <italic toggle="yes">human</italic> needs, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UNFCCC, and these treaties&#8217; respective protocols all promote respect for planetary health and are important adjuncts to the international human rights framework.</p>
