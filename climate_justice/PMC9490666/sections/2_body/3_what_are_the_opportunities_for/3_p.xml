<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For ASTMH, the ASTMH Green Task Force recommends building on the Society&#8217;s Green Statement (<xref rid="BOX2" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 2</xref>) by including an ambitious decarbonization goal in the next strategic plan. We also recommend including members with expertise in sustainability on the Board of Directors and including young people from both HIC and LMIC settings to help develop the implementation plan and deliver on the goal. ASTMH has a unique opportunity and a positive role to play by providing a platform for ASTMH members to learn from one another in terms of decarbonization and carbon literacy.</p>
