<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The data from within the CS community were extracted from a collection that had been created by Rold&#225;n-&#193;lvarez et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), originally to detect connections that characterize the relation of CS activities to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). From this dataset, we extracted tweets about climate change by custom filtering using terms such as &#8220;sdg13,&#8221; &#8220;climate action,&#8221; &#8220;climate change,&#8221; or &#8220;climate justice.&#8221; This resulted in a dataset of 26,000 original tweets and 95,000 retweets. Using a corresponding search query, Tweets about climate change originating from outside the CS community were retrieved from the Twitter space. This resulted in 71,000 additional original tweets. For the sentiment analysis, a cropped version of the T4SA reference dataset (Vadicamo et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) with the same number of tweets labeled as negative, neutral, and positive was used as a training dataset.</p>
