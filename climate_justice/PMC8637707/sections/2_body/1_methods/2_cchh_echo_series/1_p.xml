<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The CCHH ECHO Series consisted of one cohort, meeting weekly for 75&#8197;min, via a
virtual and synchronous platform. The weekly sessions were open to all health
professionals (physicians, nurses, public health professionals, community health
workers, etc). Each session consisted of 2 brief (15-25&#8197;min) evidence-based
didactic lectures, including moderated question and answer sessions. In 5 of the
sessions, a simulated case was also included to match the session's content and
illustrate the relationship between climate change and health. Project ECHO's
staff entered evidence-based journal articles and other pertinent information
into the online platform chat box that the subject matter experts discussed
during the session presentations. Participants were offered an &#8220;opt-in&#8221;
community of practice directory at the end of the course, receiving the name and
contact information for other participants. Course presentation slides, video
recordings, and digital librarian resources were also made available each week
to the participants on the Project ECHO CCHH webpage. No-cost continuing
education units (CEU) were provided for each session. Course participants also
received a certificate of completion if they attended 75% of the sessions (6 out
of 8) in the series.</p>
