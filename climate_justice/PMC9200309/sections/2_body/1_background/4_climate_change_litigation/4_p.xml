By adopting epidemiological methodologies of quantifying proportional risk, climate attribution science &#8220;aims to establish the relationship between anthropogenic emissions and specific extreme weather events&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As climate science has matured in the past decade, climate attribution methodologies are now increasingly capable of providing evidence to demonstrate causation and responsibility. By calculating the strength of the causal relationship, attribution studies bolster empirical arguments underpinning legal claims by allowing for evidence on proportional responsibility. The UNEP 2020 global status review on climate litigation suggested that climate attribution is being given more weight in the consideration of cases and determination of legally enforceable outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p>
