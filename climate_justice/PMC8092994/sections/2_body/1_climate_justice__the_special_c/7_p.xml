Washington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>) found that after Hurricane Katrina, &#8220;displaced African Americans seeking apartments have experienced housing discrimination, receiving significantly worse treatment than white apartment seekers.&#8221; Their study documented examples of post-disaster white rental applicants having application and deposit fees waived, where the black applicant received no such waivers. In another study by Peacock et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>), it was found that owner-occupied and housing in higher-income neighborhoods suffered less damage and recovered more quickly while housing with renters recovered more slowly and was susceptible to turnover.</p>
