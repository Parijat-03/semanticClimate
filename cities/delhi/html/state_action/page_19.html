The outcome of climate change on the developing and the least developed countries are excessively high due to three main reasons: first geographical location, second high dependence of people on natural resources that are highly sensitivity to climate change, third low adaptive capacity due to fewer amounts of resources available to them. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="169.56" top="549.36"><span x0="72.02" y0="549.36" x1="169.56" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 549.36; y1: 561.36; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In 2016, India&#8217;s CO</span><span x0="169.58" y0="549.25" x1="173.6" style="x0: 169.58; x1: 173.6; y0: 549.25; y1: 557.29; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="177.26" y0="549.36" x1="451.08" style="x0: 177.26; x1: 182.59; y0: 549.36; y1: 561.36; width: 5.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">emissions increased by about 4.7% to about 2.5 Gt CO2</span><span x0="451.3" y0="554.77" x1="455.32" style="x0: 451.3; x1: 455.32; y0: 554.77; y1: 562.81; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="455.38" y0="549.36" x1="508.4" style="x0: 455.38; x1: 458.38; y0: 549.36; y1: 561.36; width: 3.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">. This was mainly due to continuing GDP growth, paired with increases in fossil fuel consumption.

This will require that necessary actions in specific sectors are undertaken to reduce emission intensity with necessary provisions of financial and technological resources including the domestic and international support for achieving low carbon sustainable development.
