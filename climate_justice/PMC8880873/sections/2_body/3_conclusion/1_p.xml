We examine this question in the context of wind energy resources that Native Nations possess. The surprising finding is that wind energy potential has not translated into installed wind energy installed capacity. This suggests that tribal governments&#8217; wind energy development is far more a social, political, and economic phenomenon than a physical one.</p>
