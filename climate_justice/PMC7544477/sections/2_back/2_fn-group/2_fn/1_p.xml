<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="ntpara0020">By <italic>age of fossil fuel violence</italic>, I refer here both to the violent material and biophysical impacts (direct and indirect) of fossil fuels themselves and the vast state-corporate apparatuses (see <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Simpson, 2019</xref>) that drive dispossessions and structural violence in the name of promoting extractivism as progress. This term seeks, as with Michael Watts' &#8216;petro-violence&#8217;, to refer to ecological and social violence (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Watts, 2001</xref>), and can be (as is here) inextricably interlinked with setter-colonial violence (see also <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Whyte, 2018</xref>).</p>
