<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A natural part of the digestion process in ruminant animal species (domesticated and wild), such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, antelope, etc.</p>
<p>Microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa and viruses) present in the fore-stomach (reticulorumen or rumen) breakdown plant biomass to produce substrates that can be used by the animal for energy and growth with methane produced as a by-product. Fermentation end-products such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, formate and methyl-containing compounds are important substrates for the production of methane by the rumenâs methane-forming archaea (known as methanogens).</p>
