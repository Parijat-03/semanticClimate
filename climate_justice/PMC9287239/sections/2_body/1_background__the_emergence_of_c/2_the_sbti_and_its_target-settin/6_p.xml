Instead, SMEs automatically have their targets approved when signing a letter committing to reducing absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions 30% or 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year (consistent with the ACA method for the well-below 2&#160;&#176;C and 1.5&#160;&#176;C goals, respectively) and to measure and reduce scope 3 emissions.</p>
