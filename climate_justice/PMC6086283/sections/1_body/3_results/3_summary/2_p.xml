This is a temporal expression of the polarized distribution of ethical and techno-scientific normativity in the three documents. Acceleration of socio-political change is primarily introduced through macro-level techno-scientific and economic innovation policy programs. Deceleration on the other hand is introduced primarily through micro-level action based on individual empowerment, ethical commitment, and responsibility. This result is important because accelerating niche or micro-level activity is often recommended in order to catch up with and eventually counteract or transform fast unsustainable processes on other levels (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Geels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#160;4</label><caption><p>The complex dynamics of change processes in sustainable development according to the three documents&#8217; normative scheme. <italic>a</italic> Stands for techno-scientific acceleration, while <italic>c</italic> and <italic>b</italic> together stand for ethical deceleration of the socio-political realm on the meso-level</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11625_2017_504_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>
