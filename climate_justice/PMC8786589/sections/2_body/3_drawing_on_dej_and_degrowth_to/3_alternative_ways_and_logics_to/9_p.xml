Recognitional justice, which deals with marginalization and cultural identities (Fraser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000</xref>), is the least reflected in the bioeconomy policy. This may partly be because it is seen to be part of other Directorate-Generals (DG) and their policies and regulations (e.g. DG for justice and consumers). Proposing a decolonial justice approach is crucial if the EU is to ensure plurality and justice and to address inequalities, both globally and domestically (Sch&#246;neberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2019</xref>).</p>
