<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Cascading impacts from <em>extreme weather/climate events</em> occur when an extreme <em>hazard</em> generates a sequence of secondary events in natural and <em>human systems</em> that result in physical, natural, social or economic disruption, whereby the resulting impact is significantly larger than the initial impact. Cascading impacts are complex and multi-dimensional, and are associated more with the magnitude of <em>vulnerability</em> than with that of the hazard (modified from Pescaroli and Alexander, 2015).</p></dd>
