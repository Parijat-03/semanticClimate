The EU&#8217;s recovery plans have also directly addressed aspects of climate justice, which are mainstreamed beyond the dedicated JTM, while a Chinese focus on these matters is not apparent. In essence, the EU has prioritised a green and digital recovery, while China has prioritised a fast recovery, which entailed a rapid reopening of industry and protection of employment. However, while the Chinese stimulus can therefore be seen as a missed opportunity, it is likely to be eclipsed by new initiatives to meet the 30/60 targets.</p>
