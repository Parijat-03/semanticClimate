Over the 2020&#8211;2050 period, an increase in 12 precipitation is projected over most of Southeast Asia, with the change being more pronounced in the 13 Maritime Continent under RCP4.5. However, towards the end of the century, a high increase in precipitation 14 over the northern areas of Southeast Asia is projected under RCP8.5 (Raghavan et al., 2018a). Over 15 Vietnam, future changes in precipitation vary from &#8211;25% to +15% depending on regions and seasons, with 16 the most significant increasing trend over the coastal area during the rainy season, suggesting more severe 17 water-related disasters in this region in the future (Ngo-Duc et al., 2014). Based on 14 ensemble members of 18 CORDEX Southeast Asia simulations, which are comprised of 11 GCMs and 7 RCMs,  Tangang et al. 19 (submitted) showed significant and robust increases of mean rainfall over Indochina and the Philippines 20 while there is a drying tendency over the Maritime Continent during DJF for early, mid and end of the 21st 21 century periods at both RCP4.5 and 8.5 (Figure Atlas.32:). At the end of the 21st century during DJF under 22 RCP8.5, an increase of 20% in mean rainfall is projected over Myanmar, northern-central Thailand and 23 northern Laos, and a 5-10% increase over the eastern Philippines and northern Vietnam. During JJA, 24 significant and robust drier conditions are projected over almost the entire Southeast Asia except over 25 Myanmar and northern Borneo. The projected increase of mean rainfall over Thailand is consistent with 26 those of (Tangang et al., 2019). Over the Indonesian region, especially Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan, as 27 much as a 20% - 30% decrease in mean rainfall is projected during JJA by the end of the 21st century. 28 Nevertheless, inter-model variations can be large depending on sub-region and season. However, the 29 projected drier condition over Indonesia is consistent with that of Giorgi et al. (2019), Kang et al. (2019) and 30 Kusunoki (2017). This is also consistent with projected annual and seasonal (JJA and SON) increase of CDD 31 over the Indonesian region described by Tangang et al. (2018) and Supari et al. (submitted), particularly by 32 the middle and end of the 21st century.

Significant warming is projected to continue over 40 the entire region with temperatures increasing to about 1.5&#176;C over land regions by mid-century. Changes in 41 precipitation, however, are more uncertain. In general, there is an overall increase in mean precipitation but 42 CMIP5 and CMIP6 differ in terms of the magnitude and location of these changes. In particular, the CMIP5 43 ensemble shows significant (stronger model agreement) increase in precipitation over the Philippines and the 44 northern regions of mainland SEA (Burma), while the CMIP6 ensemble projects significant changes over the 45 southern regions of Borneo island (Indonesia).   46 47 48 </span><span style="x0: 56.71; x1: 60.36; y0: 165.59; y1: 176.57; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.71" y0="165.59" x1="215.87">[START Figure Atlas.32: HERE] </span><span x0="27.67" y0="165.59" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.67; x1: 33.15; y0: 165.59; y1: 176.57; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">49 50 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 141.5; y1: 151.52; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="141.5" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.32: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="141.5" x1="537.17" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 133.74; y0: 141.5; y1: 151.52; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The projected changes in mean precipitation expressed as a percentage (%) relative to the mean in the </span><span x0="27.66" y0="141.29" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 141.29; y1: 152.27; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">51 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="130.04" x1="534.24" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.63; y0: 130.04; y1: 140.06; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">historical period.
