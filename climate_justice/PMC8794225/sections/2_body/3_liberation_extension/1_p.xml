Ostrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>) writes that &#8220;efforts to address inequalities of access are gaining momentum&#8221; in Extension and deserve more analysis (941). Some seek to make democracy work by facilitating conversations around contentious issues and building capacities to engage in democratic decision-making (Goerlich and Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Peters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>). The efforts of many field-faculty along these lines deserve recognition.</p>
