Strengthening research on deserti&#64257;cation is of high importance not only to meet SDGs but also to manage ecosystems effectively, based on solid scienti&#64257;c knowledge. More investment in research institutes and training the younger generation of researchers is needed for addressing the combined challenges of deserti&#64257;cation and climate change (Akhtar-Schuster et al. 2011; Verstraete et al. 2011). This includes improved knowledge management systems that allow stakeholders to work in a&#160;coordinated manner by enhancing timely, targeted and contextualised information sharing (Chasek et al. 2011). Knowledge and &#64258;ow of knowledge on deserti&#64257;cation is currently highly fragmented, constraining the effectiveness of those engaged in assessing and monitoring the phenomenon at various levels (Reed et al. 2011).

Populations in most developing countries continue to rely on traditional biomass, including fuelwood, crop straws and livestock manure, for a&#160;major share of their energy needs, with the highest dependence in Sub-Saharan Africa (Amugune et al. 2017; IEA 2013). Use of biomass for energy,&#160;mostly fuelwood (especially as charcoal), was associated with deforestation in some dryland areas (Iiyama et al. 2014; Mekuria et al. 2018; Neufeldt et al. 2015; Zulu 2010), while in some other areas there was no link between fuelwood collection and deforestation (Simon and Peterson 2018; Swemmer et al. 2018; Twine and Holdo 2016). Moreover, the use of traditional biomass as a&#160;source of energy was found to have negative health effects through indoor air pollution (de la Sota et al. 2018; Lim and Seow 2012), while also being associated with lower female labour force participation (Burke and Dundas 2015). Jiang et al. (2014) indicated that providing improved access to alternative energy sources such as solar energy and biogas could help reduce the use of fuelwood in south-western China, thus alleviating the spread of rocky deserti&#64257;cation. The conversion of degraded lands into cultivation of biofuel crops will affect soil carbon dynamics (Albanito et al. 2016; Nair et al. 2011) (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;7&#160;in Chapter&#160;6). The use of biogas slurry as soil amendment or fertiliser can increase soil carbon (Galvez et al. 2012; Negash et al. 2017). Large-scale installation of wind and solar farms in the Sahara Desert was projected to create a&#160;positive climate feedback through increased surface friction and reduced albedo, doubling precipitation over the neighbouring Sahel region with resulting increases in vegetation (Li et al. 2018). Transition to renewable energy sources in high-income countries in dryland areas primarily contributes to reducing GHG emissions and mitigating climate change, with some other co-bene&#64257;ts such as diversi&#64257;cation of energy sources (Bang 2010), while the impacts on deserti&#64257;cation are less evident. The use of renewable energy has been proposed </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.81" top="735.62"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.16; y0: 735.62; y1: 745.12; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.62" x1="565.81">as an important mitigation option in dryland areas as well (El-Fadel et al. 2003). Transitions to renewable energy are being promoted by governments across drylands (Cancino-Sol&#243;rzano et al. 2016; Hong&#160;et al. 2013; Sen and Ganguly 2017) including in fossil-fuel rich countries (Farnoosh et al. 2014; Dehkordi et al. 2017; Stambouli et al. 2012; Vidadili et al. 2017), despite important social, political and technical barriers to expanding renewable energy production (Afsharzade et al.&#160;2016; Baker et al. 2014; Elum and Momodu 2017; Karatayev et al. 2016). Improving social awareness about the bene&#64257;ts of transitioning to renewable energy resources, and access to hydro-energy,&#160;solar and wind energy contributes to their improved adoption (Aliyu et al. 2017; Katikiro&#160;2016). </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.98" top="579.63"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 323.75; y0: 579.63; y1: 589.13; width: 5.99; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.77" y0="579.63" x1="565.98">Developing and strengthening climate services relevant for deserti&#64257;cation. </span><span style="x0: 401.66; x1: 406.76; y0: 567.64; y1: 577.14; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="401.66" y0="567.64" x1="565.81">Climate services provide climate, drought and deserti&#64257;cation-related information in a&#160;way that assists decision-making by individuals and organisations. Monitoring deserti&#64257;cation, and integrating biogeophysical (climate, soil, ecological factors, biodiversity) and socio-economic (use of natural resources by local population) issues provide a&#160;basis for better vulnerability prediction and assessment (OSS, 2012; Vogt et al. 2011). Examples of relevant services include: drought monitoring and early warning systems, often implemented by national climate and meteorological services but also encompassing regional and global systems (Pozzi et al. 2013); and the Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS), created by WMO in 2007, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Currently, there is also a&#160;lack of ecological monitoring in arid and semi-arid regions to study surface winds, dust and sand storms, and their impacts on ecosystems and human health (Bergametti et al. 2018; Marticorena et al. 2010).

Sustainable development of drylands and their resilience to combined challenges of deserti&#64257;cation and climate change will thus also depend on the ability of governments to promote policies for economic diversi&#64257;cation within agriculture and in non-agricultural sectors in order make dryland areas less vulnerable to deserti&#64257;cation and climate change. </span></div><div left="317.76" right="421.08" top="123.55"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 320.41; y0: 123.55; y1: 133.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.76" y0="123.55" x1="421.08">Investing into irrigation. </span><span style="x0: 423.08; x1: 425.38; y0: 123.55; y1: 133.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="423.08" y0="123.55" x1="565.82">Investments into expanding irrigation in dryland areas can help increase the resilience of agricultural production to climate change, improve labour productivity and boost production and income revenue from agriculture and livestock sectors (Geerts and Raes 2009; Olayide et al. 2016; Oweis and Hachum 2006).
