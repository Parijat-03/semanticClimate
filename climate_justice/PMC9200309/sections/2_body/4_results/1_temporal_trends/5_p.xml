Not only were allegations grounded in an explicit focus on climate change, but many cases, particularly in more recent years linked human rights (including the right to health) with de-carbonization, sought increased liability for climate risk-associated financial/investment activity, as well as legal attribution of personhood for the environmental, or legal accountability to future generations impacted by climate change. Compatible with this finding is the temporal trend of increasing likelihood of case-driven policy change across time. Indeed, in keeping with accelerating climate change, most of the cases which directly led to the passage of new climate-friendly, environmental health-rooted, or human rights-oriented legislation or legal statutes occurred in the past 5 years. This trend suggests maturation of climate law.</p>
