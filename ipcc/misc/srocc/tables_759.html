      <td>ILK is strongly associated with sustainable management of natural resources, (including land), and with autonomous adaptation to\nclimate variability and change, while also serving as a resource for externally-facilitated adaptation (Stringer et al. 2009). For example,\nwomen&#8217;s traditional knowledge adds value to a society&#8217;s knowledge base and supports climate change adaptation practices (Lane\nand McNaught 2009). In dryland environments, populations have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation to\ncope with high climatic variability, manage dynamic interactions between local communities and ecosystems, and sustain livelihoods\n(Safriel and Adeel 2008; Davies 2017). There is high confidence that pastoralists have created formal and informal institutions based\non ILK for regulating grazing, collection and cutting of herbs and wood, and use of forests across the Middle East and North Africa\n(Louhaichi and Tastad 2010; Dom&#237;nguez 2014; Auclair et al. 2011), Mongolia (Fernandez-Gimenez 2000), the Horn of Africa (Oba 2013)\nand the Sahel (Kr&#228;tli and Schareika 2010). Herders in both the Horn of Africa and the Sahel have developed complex livestock breeding\nand selection systems for their dryland environment (Kr&#228;tli 2008; Fre 2018). Numerous traditional water harvesting techniques are\nused across the drylands to adapt to climate variability: planting pits (zai, ngoro) and micro-basins and contouring hill slopes and\nterracing (Biazin et al. 2012), alongside the traditional ndiva water harvesting system in Tanzania to capture runoff in community-\nmanaged micro-dams for small-scale irrigation (Enfors and Gordon 2008).</td>

      <td>Across diverse agro-ecological systems, ILK is the basis for traditional practices to manage the landscape and sustain food production,\nwhile delivering co-benefits in the form of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience at a landscape scale (high confidence). Flexibility and\nadaptiveness are hallmarks of such systems (Richards 1985a; Biggs et al. 2013), and documented examples include: traditional integrated\nwatershed management in the Philippines (Camacho et al. 2016); widespread use of terracing, with benefits, in cases of both intensifying\nand decreasing rainfall (Arn&#225;ez et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017b) and management of water harvesting and local irrigation systems in the\nIndo-Gangetic Plains (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016). Rice cultivation in East Borneo is sustained by traditional forms of shifting cultivation,\noften involving intercropping of rice with bananas, cassava and other food crops (Siahaya et al. 2016), although the use of fire in land\nclearance implies trade-offs for climate change mitigation which have been sparsely assessed. Indigenous practices for enhanced soil\nfertility have been documented among South Asian farmers (Chandra et al. 2011; Dey and Sarkar 2011) and among Mayan farmers,\nwhere management of carbon has positive impacts on mitigation (Falkowski et al. 2016). Korean traditional groves or &#8216;bibosoop&#8217; have\nbeen shown to reduce wind speed and evaporation in agricultural landscapes (Koh et al. 2010). Particularly in the context of changing\nclimates, agriculture based on ILK that focuses on biodiversification, soil management, and sustainable water harvesting holds promise\nfor long-term resilience (Altieri and Nicholls 2017) and rehabilitation of degraded land (Maikhuri et al. 1997). ILK is also important in other\nforms of ecosystem management, such as forests and wetlands, which may be conserved by efforts such as sacred sites (Ens et al. 2015;\nPungetti et al. 2012). ILK can also play an important role in ecological restoration efforts, including for carbon sinks, through knowledge\nsurrounding species selection and understanding of ecosystem processes, like fire (Kimmerer 2000).</td>

      <td>rate of climate change and the scale of its impacts may render incremental adaptation based on the ILK of smallholders and others, less\nrelevant and less effective (Lane and McNaught 2009; Orlowsky and Seneviratne 2012; Huang et al. 2016; Morton 2017). Second,\nmaintenance and transmission of ILK across generations may be disrupted, for example, by formal education, missionary activity,\nlivelihood diversification away from agriculture, and a general perception that ILK is outdated and unfavourably contrasted with\nscientific knowledge (Speranza et al. 2010), and by HIV-related mortality (White and Morton 2005). Urbanisation can erode ILK,\nalthough ILK is constantly evolving, and becoming integrated into urban environments (J&#250;nior et al. 2016; Oteros-Rozas et al. 2013;\nvan Andel and Carvalheiro 2013). Third, ILK holders are experiencing difficulty in using ILK due to loss of access to resources, such as\nthrough large-scale land acquisition (Siahaya et al. 2016; Speranza et al. 2010; de Coninck et al. 2018). The increasing globalisation of\nfood systems and integration into global market economy also threatens to erode ILK (G&#243;mez-Baggethun et al. 2010; Oteros-Rozas\net al. 2013; McCarter et al. 2014). The potential role that ILK can play in adaptation at the local level depends on the configuration\nof a policy&#8211;institutions&#8211;knowledge nexus (Stringer et al. 2018), which includes power relations across levels and interactions with\ngovernment strategies (Alexander et al. 2011; Naess 2013).</td>

Respect for ILK is both a requirement and an entry\nstrategy for participatory climate action planning and effective communication of climate action strategies (Nyong et al. 2007). The\nnature, source, and mode of knowledge generation are critical to ensure that sustainable solutions are community-owned and fully\nintegrated within the local context (Mistry and Berardi 2016). Integrating ILK with scientific information is a prerequisite for such\ncommunity-owned solutions. Scientists can engage farmers as experts in processes of knowledge co-production (Oliver et al. 2012),</td>
