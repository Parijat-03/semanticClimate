<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A floating slab of ice originating from <em>land</em> of considerable thickness extending from the <em>coast</em> (usually of great horizontal extent with a very gently sloping surface), resulting from the flow of <em>ice sheets</em>, initially formed by the accumulation of snow, and often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet.</p>
<p>Nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica, where most of the ice <em>discharged</em> into the <em>ocean</em> flows via ice shelves.</p>
