<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We performed a mean difference test to statistically estimate the differences in the local impacts between wildfires and COVID&#8208;19 pandemics (Liu et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). We employed the Welch's t test in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) to examine the differences of sample mean between the coefficients of wildfire related variables (wildfire distance or wildfire density) and COVID&#8208;19 incidence rate (COVID case) estimated from the top&#8208;selected models to describe the spatiotemporal patterns of county&#8208;level visits per capita, minimum dwell time they spent at the park, and travel distance to park.</p>
