The extension of the growing season in high latitudes has occurred together with an earlier spring greenup (the time at which plants begin to produce leaves in northern mid- and high-latitude ecosystems) (Goetz et&#160;al. 2015; Xu et&#160;al. 2016a, 2018) with subsequent earlier spring carbon uptake (2.3 days per decade) and gross primary productivity (GPP) (Pulliainen et&#160;al. 2017). The role of direct factors of greening are being increasingly investigated and a recent study has attributed over a third of observed global greening between 2000 and 2017 to direct factors, namely afforestation and croplands, in China and India (Chen et&#160;al. 2019). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="305.29" top="483.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 483.54; y1: 493.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="483.54" x1="305.29">It should be noted that measured greening is a product of satellite-derived radiance data and, as such, does not provide information on ecosystem health indicators such as species composition and richness, homeostasis, absence of disease, vigour, system resilience and the different components of ecosystems (J&#248;rgensen et&#160;al. 2016).

Since the late 1990s rates and extents of browning have exceeded those of greening in some regions, the collective result of which has been a slowdown of the global greening rate (de&#160;Jong&#160;et&#160;al. 2012; Pan et&#160;al. 2018). Within these long-term trends, inter-annual variability of regional greening and browning is attributable to regional climate variability, responses to extremes such as drought, disease and insect infestation and large- scale tele-connective controls such as ENSO and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Organization (Verbyla&#160;2008; Revadekar et&#160;al. 2012; Epstein et&#160;al. 2018; Zhao et&#160;al. 2018). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="195.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.1; y0: 195.58; y1: 205.08; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="195.58" x1="307.57">Projected increases in drought conditions in many regions suggest long-term global vegetation greening trends are at risk of reversal to browning in a warmer climate (de Jong et&#160;al. 2012; Pan et&#160;al. 2018; Pausas and Mill&#225;n 2018).
