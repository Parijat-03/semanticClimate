The city/state of Delhi published a climate report 6 years ago. A new one is promised soon.
`pyamihtml` can convert this automatically. Decide where you want to output to go (here `delhi`)
```

pyamihtml IPCC --input  http://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Delhi-State-Action-Plan-on-Cimate-Change.pdf --outdir delhi
```

This will create tables automatically (they may not be complete)
