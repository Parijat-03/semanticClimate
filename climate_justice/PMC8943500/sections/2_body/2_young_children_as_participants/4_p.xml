It seems that children, teachers, local, national, and international politicians and businessmen don&#8217;t speak the same language. The differences point at a language divide between different stakeholders, levels and groups of people. &#196;rlemalm-Hags&#233;r and Elliott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>) argues that there is also a rhetoric-reality and a knowledge-practice gap between the expressions in international policy compared to the level of action taken with critical implications for both early childhood educators and for children&#8217;s lives.</p>
