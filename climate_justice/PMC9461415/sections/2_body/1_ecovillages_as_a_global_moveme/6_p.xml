Otherwise, the additional fourth &#8220;hidden&#8221; and subjective dimension of culture is also considered fundamental in &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; perspectives from community-led initiatives at the local level of ecovillages (Liftin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Embodying human values and worldviews that reflect more sustainable lifestyles, ecovillages can contribute to reducing negative environmental impacts and producing positive ones as indicated by several studies (Daly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>; Sherry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2019</xref>; Roysen and Mertens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>; Roysen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>), including the environmental impact assessment conducted by the Global Ecovillage Network (Global Ecovillage Network -&#160;GEN,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2022</xref>). Thus, they can contribute to promoting regenerative paradigm shifts concerning the capitalist production and consumption model, disseminated under the aegis of development.</p>
