Social work agencies focus on supporting community members&#8217; full spectrum of needs, including holistic wellness, while liaising with public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. In non-disaster settings, social workers can collaborate with certain agencies, targeting the specific needs of local residents. However, as with the current pandemic, all the societal dimensions are devastated; this calls for strategical interdisciplinary mezzo-level partnerships among diverse stakeholders. In a project partnering with Indigenous communities to learn more about their COVID-driven public health responses, the student highlighted the need for social workers to cooperate with governing bodies, Indigenous elders, health and social care service agencies, and cultural and recreation sectors to develop culturally sensitive approaches that would identify the strengthens and weaknesses of traditionally Indigenous public health efforts. This experience also formulated the student&#8217;s perception regarding the transferability of the social work-specific knowledge and skills, which could be utilized and even advanced by other groups and organizations.</p>
