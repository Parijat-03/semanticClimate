<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para40">These pieces were written before the pandemic and before lockdowns were widely instigated in response to COVID-19. And of course, these isolation measures will also have a tremendous burden on mental health for many, particularly since hardship is likely to fall most on those who are already marginalised and vulnerable. The COP26 climate conference has been postponed and there is concern that this pandemic will lead to a myopic focus on re-establishing the pre-coronavirus economic business as usual, thus detracting from carbon reduction efforts. For many this sense of a stalled process could further exacerbate feelings of eco-anxiety, combined with new pressures and concerns. The full impact of COVID-19 and associated countermeasures remains to be seen, but once we emerge from lockdown it will be into a new and uncertain world with a climate change curve still to flatten. Eco-anxiety will likely remain an important, if painful, part of our journey.</p>
