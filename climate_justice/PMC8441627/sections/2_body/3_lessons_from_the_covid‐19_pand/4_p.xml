<p>Our species needed to be shocked into an awareness that we have been barrelling towards the edge of a cliff for many decades, while showing no signs of being able to halt our &#8216;progress&#8217;. Well before Rachel Carson&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Silent Spring</italic> in 1962 and the first Earth Day in 1970, environmentalists have been warning us about overpopulation, destruction of natural habitats, loss of biodiversity, mining our lands with modern agricultural practices, the collapsing ocean fisheries, etc. Greta Thunberg rallied millions of young people to demand action on climate change, but powerful oil lobbies and vested political interests remain unmoved. The long&#8208;term consequences of climate change will render losses from a virus seem inconsequential, making this a moment for us to re&#8208;examine our fundamental relationships with each other and with the environment.</p>
