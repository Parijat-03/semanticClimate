<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We now give a flavour of how we tackled each psychological factor across the 12 videos: <italic toggle="yes">affective engagement:</italic> footage of the dramatic impacts of the climate crisis on people's health and living condition (e.g. communities devastated by floods); <italic toggle="yes">collective efficacy</italic>: footage of collective climate action such as the Sunrise movement campaigns that achieved a shift in political priorities; <italic toggle="yes">social norms</italic>: interviews with professors and peer-student activists talking about their experiences, bonds and mentorship within their activist community; <italic toggle="yes">faith in institutions</italic>: a combination of the history of unproductive international and national climate policy initiatives, combined with examples of current politicians that have an earnest climate crisis focus; <italic toggle="yes">self-identity</italic>: scenes that would engage, for example, self-identified naturalists and social justice advocates; <italic toggle="yes">self-efficacy and attitudes</italic>: testimonies of other students devoting themselves to making change; <italic toggle="yes">theory of change</italic>: interviews of activists and academics analysing the history of social movements and the feasibility of local climate activism in driving policy change; and <italic toggle="yes">imagination</italic>: hypothetical scenarios of a future world following a transition away from fossil fuels. The two other factors of <italic toggle="yes">perceived behavioural control</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">intentions</italic> were covered by including footage of student activists addressing the feasibility of climate activism as yet another extra-curricular activity.</p>
