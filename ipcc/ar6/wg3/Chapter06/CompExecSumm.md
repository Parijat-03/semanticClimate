Executive Summary 
Warming cannot be limited to well below 2°C without rapid and deep reductions in energy system 2
CO2 and GHG emissions. In scenarios limiting likely warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot (likely 3
below 2°C), net energy system CO2 emissions (interquartile range) fall by 87% to 97%% (60% to 79%) 4
in 2050. In 2030, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net CO2 and 5
GHG emissions fall by 35-51% and 38-52% respectively. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with 6
no or limited overshoot (likely below 2°C), net electricity sector CO2 emissions reach zero globally 7
between 2045 and 2055 (2050 and 2080) (high confidence) {6.7} 8
Limiting warming to well below 2°C will require substantial energy system changes over the next 9
30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption, increased production from low- and zero- 10
carbon energy sources, and increased use of electricity and alternative energy carriers. Coal 11
consumption without CCS falls by 67% to 82% (interquartile range) in 2030 in scenarios limiting 12
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. Oil and gas consumption fall more slowly. Low-carbon 13
sources produce 93% to 97% of global electricity by 2050 in scenarios that limit likely warming to 2°C 14
or below. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (likely below 2°C), 15
electricity supplies 48% to 58% (36% to 47%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. (high 16
confidence) {6.7} 17
Net Zero energy systems will share common characteristics, but the approach in every country 18
will depend on national circumstances. Common characteristics of net zero energy systems will 19
include: (1) electricity systems that produce no net CO2 or remove CO2 from the atmosphere; (2) 20
widespread electrification of end uses, including light-duty transport, space heating, and cooking; (3) 21
substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today (4) use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, 22
bioenergy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification; (5) more 23
efficient use of energy than today; (6) greater energy system integration across regions and across 24
components of the energy system; and (7) use of CO2 removal (e.g., DACCS, BECCS) to offset any 25
residual emissions. (high confidence) {6.6} 26
Energy demands and energy sector emissions have continued to rise. From 2015 to 2019, global 27
final energy consumption grew by 6.6%, CO2 emissions from the global energy system grew by 4.6%, 28
and total GHG emissions from energy supply rose by 2.7%. Methane emissions, mainly fugitive 29
emissions from oil, gas, and coal, accounted for 18% of GHG emissions in 2019. Coal electricity 30
capacity grew by 7.6% between 2015 and 2019, as new builds in some countries offset declines in 31
others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew 32
by 15%. Declining energy intensity in almost all regions has been balanced by increased energy 33
consumption. (high confidence) {6.3} 34
Prices have dropped rapidly over the last five years for several key energy system mitigation 35
options, notably solar PV, wind power, and batteries. From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity 36
from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity 37
from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles 38
are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on 39
electricity grids is increasingly viable. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.4} 40
Global wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% 41
(to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit 42
fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. 43
Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of 44
total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted 45
for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 46

16% (4290 TWh) of total generation. In total, low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies 1
produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.4} 2
If investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked-in to 3
higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to well below 2°C. Many aspects of the energy 4
system – physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour – are resistant to 5
change or take many years to change. New investments in coal-fired electricity without CCS are 6
inconsistent with limiting warming to well below 2°C. (high confidence) {6.3, 6.7} 7
Limiting warming to well below 2°C will strand fossil-related assets, including fossil 8
infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. The economic impacts of stranded assets could 9
amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets 10
are more vulnerable toward mid-century. CCS can allow fossil fuels to be used longer, reducing 11
potential stranded assets. (high confidence) {6.7} 12
A low-carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic 13
opportunities. Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if likely 14
warming is limited to 2°C or below. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the 15
reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels 16
(extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, nuclear power, 17
CCS, electricity networks and storage, and end-use energy efficiency. A significant and growing share 18
of investments between now and 2050 will be made in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. (high 19
confidence) {6.7} 20
Climate change will affect many future local and national low-carbon energy systems. The 21
impacts, however, are uncertain, particularly at the regional scale. Climate change will alter 22
hydropower production, bioenergy and agricultural yields, thermal power plant efficiencies, and 23
demands for heating and cooling, and it will directly impact power system infrastructure. Climate 24
change will not affect wind and solar resources to the extent that it would compromise their ability to 25
reduce emissions. (high confidence) {6.5} 26
Electricity systems powered predominantly by renewables will be increasingly viable over the 27
coming decades, but it will be challenging to supply the entire energy system with renewable 28
energy. Large shares of variable solar PV and wind power can be incorporated in electricity grids 29
through batteries, hydrogen, and other forms of storage; transmission; flexible non-renewable 30
generation; advanced controls; and greater demand-side responses. Because some applications (e.g., air 31
travel) are not currently amenable to electrification, 100% renewable energy systems would likely need 32
to include alternative fuels such as hydrogen or biofuels. Economic, regulatory, social, and operational 33
challenges increase with higher shares of renewable electricity and energy. The ability to overcome 34
these challenges in practice is not fully understood. {high confidence} {6.6} 35
Multiple energy supply options are available to reduce emissions over the next decade. Nuclear 36
power and hydropower are already established technologies. Solar PV and wind are now cheaper than 37
fossil-generated electricity in many locations. Bioenergy accounts for about a tenth of global primary 38
energy. Carbon capture is widely used in the oil and gas industry, with early applications in electricity 39
production and biofuels. It will not be possible to widely deploy all of these and other options without 40
efforts to address the geophysical, environmental-ecological, economic, technological, socio-cultural, 41
and institutional factors that can facilitate or hinder their implementation. (high confidence) {6.4} 42
Some mitigation options can provide more immediate and cost-effective emissions reductions 43
than others, but a comprehensive approach will be required over the next ten years to limit 44
warming to well below 2°C. There are substantial, cost-effective opportunities to reduce emissions 45
rapidly in several sectors, including electricity generation and light-duty transportation. But near-term 46
reductions in these sectors will not be sufficient to limit warming to well below 2°C. A broad-based 47

approach across the energy sector will be necessary to reduce emissions over the next ten years and to 1
set the stage for still deeper reductions beyond 2030. (high confidence) {6.4, 6.6, 6.7} 2
Enhanced integration across energy system sectors and across scales will lower costs and facilitate 3
low-carbon energy system transitions. Greater integration between the electricity sector and end use 4
sectors can facilitate integration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) options. Energy systems can be 5
integrated across district, regional, national, and international scales. (high confidence) {6.4, 6.6} 6
The viable speed and scope of a low-carbon energy system transition will depend on how well it 7
can support sustainable development goals (SDGs) and other societal objectives. Energy systems 8
are linked to a range of societal objectives, including energy access, air and water pollution, health, 9
energy security, water security, food security, economic prosperity, international competitiveness, 10
employment. These linkages and their importance vary among regions. Energy sector mitigation and 11
efforts to achieve SDGs generally support one another, though there are important region-specific 12
exceptions. (high confidence) {6.1, 6.7} 13
The economic outcomes of low-carbon transitions in some sectors and regions may be on par with, 14
or superior to those of an emissions-intensive future. Cost reductions in key technologies, 15
particularly in electricity and light-duty transport, have increased the economic attractiveness of near- 16
term low-carbon transitions. Long-term mitigation costs are not well understood and depend on policy 17
design and implementation, and the future costs and availability of technologies. Advances in low- 18
carbon energy resources and carriers such as next-generation biofuels, hydrogen produced from 19
electrolysis, synthetic fuels, and carbon-neutral ammonia would substantially improve the economics 20
of net zero energy systems. (medium confidence) {6.4, 6.7}
