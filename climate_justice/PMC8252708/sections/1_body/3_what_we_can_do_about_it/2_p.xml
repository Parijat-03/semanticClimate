For environmental justice, the toll of tobacco on deforestation, solid waste and water, and soil and air pollution, are well documented and tobacco control offers a cost-effective means of mitigating environmental degradation. In terms of economic justice, joint work by UNDP, the Secretariat of the FCTC and WHO with governments in many countries<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> has documented the disproportionate health and economic benefits that accrue to lower income populations when tobacco control is scaled up, making it a significant accelerator of SDG 10 on reducing inequalities. Gender justice should incorporate tobacco control to address the disproportionate harms to women exposed to tobacco secondhand smoke and the increasing rates of tobacco use among women in some region. Social justice movements should also take into account tobacco control given the long history of the tobacco industry of co-opting movement for social change, such as racial and LGBTI equality, to advance their interests at the expense of the targeted populations.</p>
