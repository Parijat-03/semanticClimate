One such strategy is the principle of <italic>sufficiency and voluntary frugality</italic> (Kallis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). Sufficiency is opposed to excess and accumulation and can be explained using Raworth&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2012</xref>) idea of &#8216;living within the doughnut&#8217; or living within a safe and just space for humanity, where everyone has a solid social foundation without overshooting the ecological ceiling or limits. Embracing sufficiency in GDP-richer EU countries can lead to faster reductions of throughput of energy. Since the wealth accumulation by GDP-richer countries and economic elites relocates social and ecological damage to global peripheries, adopting sufficiency in the GDP-rich countries also directly advances global socioecological justice.</p>
