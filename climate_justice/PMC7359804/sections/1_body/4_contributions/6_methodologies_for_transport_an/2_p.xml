<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0190">Transport and mobility justice research cannot, and should not, stay clear from discussions about ethics and epistemic justice (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Butz and Cook, 2018</xref>). However, much past transport and mobilities research has avoided in-depth engagement with ethical and moral issues when developing methodological approaches to investigate equity and justice. Some exceptions include <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Butz and Cook (2018)</xref>, who reflect on the use of visual methods, and <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Lucas (2013)</xref>, who has highlighted the value of action research to address current social and environmental challenges posed by transport impacts. In any case, the &#8216;toolkit&#8217; of research methods for fully considering the complexity of transport equity and justice is rather small and could be expanded. The papers in this theme respond to these concerns and provide some new important methodological approaches. Guided by procedural justice and recognition, they use co-production and reflexivity in designing research methods and political actions for discussing, investigating and reframing mobility justice.</p>
