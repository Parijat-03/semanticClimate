Ruminants have been associated with humans since the early development of agriculture, and the role of ruminants in many agricultural systems and smallholder communities is substantial. Ruminant production systems have been adapted to a&#160;wide range of socioeconomic and environmental conditions in crop, forestry, and food processing settings&#160;(&#268;olovi&#263; et al. 2019), bioenergy production&#160;(de Souza et al. 2019), and food waste recycling (Westendorf 2000). Pasture cultivation in succession to crops is recognised as important to management of pest and diseases cycles and to improve soil carbon stocks and soil quality&#160;(Carvalho and Dedieu 2014). Grazing livestock is important as a&#160;reserve of food and economic stocks for some smallholders&#160;(Ouma et al. 2003).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="531.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.1; y0: 531.13; y1: 540.63; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="531.13" x1="307.57">Possible land-use options for&#160;transitions&#160;away from livestock production in a&#160;range of systems include (a) retain land but reduce investments to run a&#160;more extensive production system; (b) change land use by adopting a&#160;different production activity; (c)&#160;abandon land (or part of the farm) to allow secondary vegetation regrowth&#160;(Carvalho et al. 2019 and Laue and Arima 2016); and (d)&#160;invest in afforestation or reforestation&#160;(Baynes et al. 2017). The extensification option could lead to increases rather than decreases in GHG emissions related to reduction in beef consumption. Large-scale abandonment, afforestation, or reforestation would probably have more positive environmental outcomes, but could result in economic and social issues that would require governmental subsidies to avoid decline and migration in some regions&#160;(Henderson et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.54" top="363.15"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 363.15; y1: 372.65; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="363.15" x1="307.54">Alternative economic use of land, such as bioenergy production, could balance the negative socioeconomic impact of reducing beef output, reduce the tax values needed to reduce consumption, and avoid extensification of ruminant production systems&#160;(Wirsenius et al. 2011). However, the analysis of the&#160;transition&#160;of land use for ruminants to other agricultural production systems is still a&#160;literature gap (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;7&#160;in Chapter&#160;6). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="267.16"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 267.16; y1: 276.66; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="267.16" x1="307.57">Finally, it is important to recognise that, while energy alternatives produce the same function for the consumer, it is questionable that providing the same nutritional value through an optimised mix of dietary ingredients provides the same utility for humans. Food has a&#160;central role in human pleasure, socialisation, cultural identity, and health (R&#246;&#246;s et al. 2017), including some of the most vulnerable groups, so&#160;Just&#160;Transitions&#160;and their costs need to be taken into account.

Miles et al. (2017) stated that a&#160;research and policy feedback that allows transitions to sustainable food systems must take a&#160;whole system approach. Currently, in transmitting knowledge for food security and land sustainability under climate change there are three major approaches: (i) public technology transfer with demonstration (extension agents); (ii) public and private advisory services (for intensification techniques) and; (iii) non-formal education with many different variants such as farmer field schools, rural resource centres; facilitation extension where front-line agents primarily work as &#8216;knowledge brokers&#8217; in facilitating the teaching-learning process among all types of farmers (including women and rural young people), or farmer-to-farmer, where farmers act themselves as knowledge transfer and sharing actors through peer processes.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="480.31" top="506.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 506.98; y1: 516.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="506.98" x1="480.31">1.7.4.1 Indigenous and local knowledge</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="483.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 483.11; y1: 492.61; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="483.11" x1="566.09">Recent discourse has a&#160;strong orientation towards scaling-up innovation and adoption by local farmers. However, autonomous adaptation, indigenous knowledge and local knowledge are both important for agricultural adaptation (Biggs et al. 2013) (Section&#160;5.3). These involve the promotion of farmer participation in governance structures, research, and the design of systems for the generation and dissemination of knowledge and technology, so that farmers&#8217; needs and knowledge can be taken into consideration. Klenk et al. (2017) found that mobilisation of local knowledge can inform adaptation decision-making and may facilitate greater flexibility in government-funded research. As an example, rural innovation in terrace agriculture developed on the basis of a&#160;local coping mechanism and adopted by peasant farmers in Latin America may serve as an adaptation option or starting place for learning about climate change responses (Bocco and Napoletano 2017). Clemens et al. (2015) found that an open dialogue platform enabled horizontal exchange of ideas and alliances for social learning and knowledge-sharing in Vietnam. Improving local technologies in a&#160;participatory manner, through on-farm experimentation, farmer-to-farmer exchange, consideration of women and youths, is also relevant in mobilising knowledge and technologies. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="413.46" top="230.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 230.98; y1: 240.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="230.98" x1="413.46">1.7.4.2 Citizen science</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="207.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 207.11; y1: 216.61; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="207.11" x1="566.12">Citizen science has been tested as a&#160;useful tool with potential for biodiversity conservation (Schmitz et al. 2015) and mobilising knowledge from society.
