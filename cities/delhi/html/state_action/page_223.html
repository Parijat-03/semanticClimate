The practice of science right down to the grass-roots can be done with Biological Diversity Act. This Act provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees in all local bodies, whether Panchayats or Municipalities throughout the country. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.34" top="615.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="615.27" x1="526.34" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 615.27; y1: 627.27; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 2: Understanding low carbon development pathways which aims to point out ways how to combine both: climate protection and sustainable development. By understanding and exploring sustainable low carbon development pathways in Delhi could serve as regional and international example as well.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="278.33" top="541.56"><span x0="72.02" y0="541.56" x1="278.33" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 81.36; y0: 541.56; y1: 553.56; width: 9.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Key Strategy 3: Knowledge Application </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.11" top="515.88"><span x0="72.02" y0="515.88" x1="526.11" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 515.88; y1: 527.88; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 1: Periodic development of knowledge products on climate change. The objective of this action point is to synthesize existing knowledge base in the state to form knowledge products for decision-making, addressing climate risks and opportunities. These products can be in the form of working papers, technical reports, peer-reviewed articles and policy briefs to aid evidence-based policy making. The focus in this will be on integration of perceptions and practices of people with scientific analysis to validate, standardize and scaling up of these traditional knowledge systems. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.28" top="394.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="394.78" x1="526.28" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 394.78; y1: 406.78; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 2: Environment and Climate Change museum could catalyze a cultural transformation around climate, inviting people from all walks of life into the conversation and building community around solutions. Transcending traditional disciplinary and societal boundaries, the Museums bring people together to learn about the problem, grieve what has been lost, actively engage with solutions, and join the fight for a brighter future. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.24" top="305.5"><span x0="72.02" y0="305.5" x1="526.24" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 305.5; y1: 317.5; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 3: Resource centre on Climate Change provides information about climate change impacts on forests and other ecosystems, and approaches to adaptation and mitigation in the state. The website based resource centre compile and create educational resources, climate change and carbon tools, video presentations, literature, and briefings on management-relevant topics, ranging from basic climate change information to details on specific management responses. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.35" top="200.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="200.23" x1="526.35" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 200.23; y1: 212.23; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Action 4: Mainstreaming of climate change concerns into developmental programmes and policies. Mainstreaming climate concerns into ongoing developmental initiatives can offer opportunities for adaptation and mitigation in the state. For example, while development is essential for adaptation, adaptation is imperative to safeguard developmental investments. Similarly it is essential to embark on a low-carbon pathway to aid adaptation efforts. This action can facilitate policymakers and vulnerable communities deploy findings of research into practice and identify potential entry points with the scope of current and planned developmental programmes and policies for reducing risks or tapping opportunities posed by climate change. </span></div></body></html>
