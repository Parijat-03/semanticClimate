This may imply at the same time a set of solutions to domestic/regional issues and a leading role in long-term global economic development for both players. Furthermore, the withdrawal of the USA from the Paris Accords under the Trump administration had facilitated the creation of strategic convergences. In times of worsening China-USA trade wars, UNFCCC negotiations have become unstable, but China and the EU have so far endeavoured to come together multilaterally towards more climate ambition. The recent election of Biden and Harris in the USA opens a series of doubts and ambiguities in the way of China-EU strategic confluence of interests. How this situation will evolve under the Biden-Harris administration is still to be monitored, but as Wright and Nyberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2015</xref>) argue, despite the need for dramatic economic and political transformations to deal with the climate crisis, capitalism continues to shape&#8212;whether through the distribution of wealth or the &#8216;business as usual&#8217; of corporations&#8212;global practices, targets and solutions.</p>
