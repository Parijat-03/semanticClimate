[<xref rid="B83-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], to ensure effective weather monitoring around a farm, the authors designed a very cheap cloud-based weather measurement unit, using an integration of different unique weather sensors. The system, which is made up of a base and a weather station, as well as a display unit, is capable of effectively gathering humidity, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and many other weather data types. By experimenting its usage and statistically analyzing gathered data, it was observed that the unit provided similar results as the Davis Vantage Pro2 weather monitor, which was pre-installed on the same farm, thus, offering a cheaper option [<xref rid="B83-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p>
