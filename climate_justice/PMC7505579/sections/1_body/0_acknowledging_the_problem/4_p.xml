<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0015">Relatively, demand is largely underrepresented, via technological options in energy efficiency improvements. Values, choices, cohesion, culture, and lifestyle shifts in society are indirectly narrated as assumptions <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> not interacting with the vividly modelled flows between technology, economy, environment, and policy. Even modelling scenarios looking at end-use transformations, like digitalisation of daily life and pervasive integration of new information technologies into energy services <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, mostly explore the maximum potential of technological breakthroughs taking into account a number of behavioural changes but not fully exploring how they could come about or how realistic they are. They overlook that, without the necessary behavioural and societal transformations, the world is very possibly looking at a generalised, society-wide rebound effect resembling known paradoxes <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This diverse range of possible, potentially large rebound effects is not sufficiently explored.</p>
