They are likely to require the same or similar capabilities as us, through similar foreseeable means, and our decisions will have an immediate impact on their capabilities. This may suffice, but it would still entail large sacrifices when it comes to mitigating emissions. However, a large portion of those sacrifices would not be morally relevant, as it would involve &#8216;luxury emissions&#8217;. If lowering such emissions does not require pushing people below the threshold, it is a non-tragic choice. Stated differently, policies to <italic>lower</italic> the GJ per capita emissions and energy use of those above the threshold, to permit for others below the threshold to reach above it is consistent with the CA supplemented with ceilings.</p>
