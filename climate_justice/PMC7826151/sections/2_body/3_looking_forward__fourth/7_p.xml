During COVID-19, we witnessed an expansion of mandates and actions based on social responsibility. Some science museums are engaging in complicated conversations about the pandemic with their publics. For example, the Exploratorium in San Francisco (U.S.A.) has been hosting monthly <italic>COVID Conversations</italic> online events, where the audience can dialogue with experts and share their doubts and concerns regarding the pandemic. The Museum of Science in Boston created the exhibit &#8220;Ask a virtual Expert&#8221; in which the audience can ask questions about the coronavirus directly to a leading public health specialist. Additionally, this museum hosted a community-wide town-hall online forum about the COVID-19 coronavirus. Focusing on this event the museum wrote:<disp-quote><p id="Par25">This important public conversation was for anyone interested in learning about making informed decisions for themselves and their families; the science behind this outbreak; local and state resiliency planning; and community support resources and organizing [&#8230;] The Museum is proud to have hosted this critical, timely conversation [&#8230;] Attendees asked questions and learned more about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the implications it has on an individual and community level.
