<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">line 218: 91F is a very low threshold - does this come from one of the cited studies? 91 may be relevant to particularly vulnerable sub-groups (e.g. the elderly and the immunocompromised), but I think you need to better justify why you chose such a low threshold, particularly when much of California is relatively dry.</p>
