The socio-historical configuration of the current international order includes, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the trajectories of wealth distribution between and within nations, the hegemonic disputes between states, the end of the Bretton Woods agreements, the interstate competition over natural, energy, and financial resources, the anticolonial wars, the petroleum crisis in the 1970s, the end of the Cold War, the construction of multilateral organizations, the advent of globalization as a complex and multidimensional phenomenon and the contribution of neoliberalism as economic, moral and political reason to the ascent of antidemocratic politics (Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>). These are all factors that created new conceptions of the role of the state, but also of markets, individuals, families and societies.</p>
