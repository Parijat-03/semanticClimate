It also makes clear that if countries were to choose the consideration and interpretation that indicates the maximum equity-compatible emission level, i.e., the least emission reduction for them, the overall emissions reduction target for the EU for 2030 would be missed by a wide margin, in particular since interpretations can even be found for a majority of countries which would require zero reductions from 2005 levels.</p>
