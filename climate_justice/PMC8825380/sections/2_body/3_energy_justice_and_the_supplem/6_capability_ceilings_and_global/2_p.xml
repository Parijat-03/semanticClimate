Scenario III is effectively putting a ceiling on the capabilities of D&#8211;G. There are likely technical difficulties that prevent any clear judgment regarding distribution. For instance, could energy forfeited by G be transferred to A in any feasible manner, and will it be as efficient when turned into useful energy by A? This will depend on the types of energy. Fossil fuels have the merits of being easily redistributed and utilised&#8212;preferably utilised in as highly efficient manner as possible and without causing ill health and danger (which is common in, for instance, traditional kitchen stoves) (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 349). There are currently modest possibilities for meeting increased energy consumption on a global level without increasing emission of fossil fuels, but alternatives in developing countries would include &#8216;off-grid&#8217; electricity, and possible &#8216;leapfrogging&#8217; energy stages (van de Graaf &amp; Sovacool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>: 71) to meet growing energy demands without increasing emission levels, conjunct with ambitious mitigation policies of high-emitters.</p>
