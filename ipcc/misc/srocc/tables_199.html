      <td>Arsiso et al. 2018; Elagib 2011; Lokoshchenko 2017; Robaa 2013). In addition, there is high confidence that the UHI effect makes\nheatwaves more intense in cities by 1.22&#8211;4&#176;C, particularly at night (Li and Bou-Zeid 2013; Li et al. 2017b; Hamdi et al. 2016; Founda\nand Santamouris 2017; Wang et al. 2017a). As there is a well-established relationship between extremely high temperatures and\nmorbidity, mortality (Watts et al. 2015) and labour productivity (Costa et al. 2016), an expected increase in extreme heat events\nwith future climate change will worsen the conditions in cities.</td>

      <td>Individual city case studies show that precipitation mean and extremes are increased over and downwind of urban areas, especially\nin the afternoon and early evening when convective rise of the atmosphere is the strongest (medium confidence). The case studies\ncovered: different inland and coastal US cities (Haberlie et al. 2014; McLeod et al. 2017; Ganeshan and Murtugudde 2015), Dutch\ncoastal cities (Daniels et al. 2016), Hamburg (Schl&#252;nzen et al. 2010), Shanghai (Liang and Ding 2017), Beijing (Dou et al. 2014), and\nJakarta and Kuala Lumpur (Lorenz et al. 2016). Increased aerosol concentrations, however, can interrupt the precipitation formation\nprocess and thereby reduce heavy rainfall (Daniels et al. 2016; Zhong et al. 2017). Urban areas also experience altered water cycle\nin other aspects: the evaporative demand for plants in cities are increased by as much as 10% (Zipper et al. 2017), while the high\nproportion of paving in cities means that surface runoff of water is high (Hamdi et al. 2011; Pataki et al. 2011). In addition, water\nretention is lower in degraded, sealed soils beneath urban surfaces compared to intact soils. Increased surface water runoff, especially\nwhen and where the rainfall intensity is likely to intensify (IPCC 2013a), leads to a greater likelihood of flooding in urban areas without\nimplementation of adaptation measures (Shade and Kremer 2019; Wang et al. 2013; EPA 2015).</td>

      <td>Urbanisation alters the stock size of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its stability. The conversion of vegetated land to urban land\nresults in a loss of carbon stored in plants, while stresses associated with the urban environment (e.g., heat, limited water availability,\npollution) reduce plant growth and survival in cities (Xu et al. 2016b). Overall, carbon densities or stocks decrease from natural land\nareas to the urban core along the rural-urban gradient (Tao et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). For example, the Seoul Forest Park, an\nurban park, shows a tenfold difference in SOC stocks across its land cover types (Bae and Ryu 2015). In Changchun in Northeast\nChina, however, SOC density is higher in recreational forests within urban areas compared to a production forest (Zhang et al. 2015).</td>

      <td>Urban air pollution as an environmental risk increases with climate change. Increased air temperatures can lead to reduced air\nquality by enhancing the formation of photochemical oxidants and increasing the concentration of air pollutants such as ozone, with\ncorresponding threats to human health (Sharma et al. 2013). The occurrence of bronchial asthma and allergic respiratory diseases\nis increasing worldwide, and urban residents are experiencing poor air quality conditions more frequently than rural residents</td>
