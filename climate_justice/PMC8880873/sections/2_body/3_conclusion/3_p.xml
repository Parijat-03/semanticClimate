Installing turbines is both costly and lengthy. It involves confronting many administrative hurdles. A turbine proposal is not a frivolous exercise; tribes must submit a great deal of specific data about their plans to the FAA. Tribes may seek FAA approval while they are still recruiting outside investors. Future research could explore why certain proposals get translated into actual turbines, even within the context of a given tribe, and explain the variation in the time from plan proposal to turbine installation. This analysis could add further nuance to the understanding of wind industry development in tribal lands.</p>
