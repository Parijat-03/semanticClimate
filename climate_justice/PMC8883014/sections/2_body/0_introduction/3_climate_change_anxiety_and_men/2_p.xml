Factor analyses identified two subscales: <italic>cognitive emotional impairment</italic>, including rumination, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and nightmares or crying; and <italic>functional impairment</italic>, reflecting difficulty engaging in work or academic responsibilities and relationships due to CCA. In the initial validation study of the CCA scale among adults in the United States using an MTurk sample, a measure of MDD and GAD symptoms was strongly correlated with cognitive emotional impairment (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;.54) and functional impairment (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;.47), indicating that CCA is related to, but not fully accounted by, depression and anxiety symptoms. While this provides important preliminary data about the relationship between CCA and psychiatric symptoms, the study used a brief four-item measure of combined MDD and GAD symptoms (PHQ-4; Kroenke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009a</xref>) without distinguishing between them. Similarly, another recent study showed an association between CCA and overall mental health among Filipino emerging adults (Reyes et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>), but did not examine how CCA may relate differently to different types of psychiatric symptoms. Thus, there is a need for greater clarity on how CCA relates to the clinical constructs of MDD and GAD.</p>
