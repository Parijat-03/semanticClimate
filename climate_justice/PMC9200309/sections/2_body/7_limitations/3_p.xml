Indeed, we observed a far greater number of cases which alluded to aspects of public health under threat without explicitly using the word &#8220;health&#8221;. The relative importance of these cases should not be overlooked, for they undoubtedly represent a shifting mindset towards climate change, with the perceived threats to human health taking a more central role.</p>
