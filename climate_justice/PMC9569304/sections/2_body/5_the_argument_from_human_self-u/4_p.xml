Rather, it is the <italic>opportunity</italic> to procreate that is regarded as distinctly valuable for human beings. Those who choose to abstain from procreating should (and in almost all cases will) also value the freedom to choose: it is that freedom to choose that we regard as distinctively human,&#160;that is valuable. This conceptualization of the value of procreation also allows us to understand the great sorrow experienced by those who wish to procreate but who cannot, which is not expressed in terms of not being able to access certain levels of welfare or consumer goods, but rather in terms of having to grieve over a relationship one hoped to have but does not have access to. Based on the arguments put forward by Ferracioli, one can see that this group of people is missing out on a distinct and uniquely deep and robust relationship of love.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn36">36</xref></p>
