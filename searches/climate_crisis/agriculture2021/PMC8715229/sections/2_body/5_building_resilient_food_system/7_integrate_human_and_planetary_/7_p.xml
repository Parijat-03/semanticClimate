<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0450">Water resources are critically important for food and energy security and for environmental health. Management of water resources should therefore shift from a sectoral focus to a nexus approach that would take account of the interconnectedness and interdependence of water as a resource. The shift toward more sustainable use of water for human purposes (water for energy, food, sanitation, and hygiene) needs to take into consideration the importance of improving irrigation efficiency to maximize the crop production per unit water as well as wastewater recycling as an option to respond to water demands across sectors. Within agricultural production systems, the management of water should be embedded in broader efforts to scale up climate-resilient agricultural practices and support for nature-positive food production, such as agroecology, permaculture, agroforestry systems, sustainable land management, integrated water resource management, and locally adapted precision agriculture as means to reduce GHG emissions and pollution and sustainably manage natural resources.</p>
