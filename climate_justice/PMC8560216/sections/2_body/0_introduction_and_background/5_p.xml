Discussions in the podcast take an intersectional approach, looking at how social identities&#8212;such as race, ethnicity, social class, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity&#8212;overlap with one another and with oppressive systems of power that shape the experiences of the guests in their workplaces, activism, and broader community (Crenshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). An interdisciplinary, intersectional approach captures the reality of the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic issues. The topics, issues, and discussions in the podcast cover both the natural and social sciences and are primarily focused on the United States. However, some guests and conversations also include global perspectives. Two main topics are explored in the podcast: (1) Environmental challenges that are exacerbated for historically underrepresented communities due to oppressive systems such as structural racism and white supremacy, and (2) movements&#8212;such as environmental justice and disability justice&#8212;that have formed in response to, and in an effort to, dismantle these oppressive systems. Examples of systems of structural racism in the United States include mass incarceration, hiring practices, unequal access to education and health care, and redlining (Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>).</p>
