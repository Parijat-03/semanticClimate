Such an agenda can help co-produce cutting-edge knowledge with societal end-users in combining horizontal (across diverse social groups, across space) and vertical (across time) dimensions of societal scenarios towards shared futures, and address the 'failure of imagination' <xref rid="b0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref> on climate change, from an interdisciplinary perspective. Imagining new societal futures, including the policies, technologies, behaviours, values and change processes, is something that scientists and decision-makers need to learn, visualise and put into practice <xref rid="b0540" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>.</p>
