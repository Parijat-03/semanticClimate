We then used the function &#8220;refine&#8221; to select a subset of 383 articles relevant to social sciences according to the Web of Science categories of urban studies, development studies, political science, and international relations. This search included articles tagged for the keywords &#8220;urban&#8221; or &#8220;municipal.&#8221; We excluded books and book chapters.</p>
