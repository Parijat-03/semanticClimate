There are important nursing roles in clinical practice integrating climate change knowledge in the assessment and care of individuals, families, communities, and populations. It is critical to educate all those whom for whom public health nurses provide care, however there are key distinctions in that vulnerable and marginalized populations are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality in the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Thus it is essential for public health nurses to educate those whom they serve regarding the acute and chronic impacts of climate change amidst the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic; this is critical due to the complex intersection of overlapping health challenges that may occur in our current crisis. Furthermore, vulnerable and marginalized populations are also disproportionately affected by the deleterious consequences of climate change. Exposure to poor air with associated respiratory challenges such as asthma leads to higher morbidity and mortality, particularly in pediatric populations and those with co&#8208;morbid chronic illnesses. Sharing public health knowledge with individuals, families, communities, and populations about the emergence of pandemics, the intersection with climate change, and that infectious diseases are more likely to emerge in our climate&#8208;changing world are key roles for public health nurses.</p>
