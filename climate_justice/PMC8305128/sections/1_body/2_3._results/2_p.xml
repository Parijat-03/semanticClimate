<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most communes register incidences over 2875, but in the southern Araucan&#237;a Region, some communes exceed 6200 infections per 100,000 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), spatially coinciding with the highest recorded mortality values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Chronic exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f002">Figure 2</xref>D) varies throughout the Chilean territory. In both cases, communes exceeding the maximum annual concentration value defined by the WHO (PM<sub>10</sub>: annual average 20 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>; PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 10 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>) are shown in yellow, and those in red also exceed the Chilean AQ standard (PM<sub>10</sub>: annual average 50 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>; PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 20 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>). In general, there are high concentration values of particulate matter of both fractions and a high incidence of COVID-19 in the central and south-central Chilean communes.</p>
