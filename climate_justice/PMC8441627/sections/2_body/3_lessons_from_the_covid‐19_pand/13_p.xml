<p>The dimensions of the changes required are in the archetypal domain of a paradigm shift. Jung believed a new paradigm had to come to the West and countries influenced by the West, which is now the entire world. In 1940 he labelled that shift a &#8216;New Age&#8217; as we approached &#8216;the meridian of the first star in Aquarius&#8217; (Jung&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">1940</xref>, p. 285). Significant elements in the shift, as Jung saw it, were a rise in the importance of the archetypal feminine, new spiritual forms, and a concern about the decimation of the environment. Transition from one age to another entails a great deal of confusion and fear as old power structures and institutions, including religious institutions, crumble and die or are significantly reconfigured. It is hard to imagine changing the corporate model given the economic and structural power behind it, including the conservative Supreme Court nominees Trump put in place, but that is but one aspect of a necessary paradigm shift.</p>
