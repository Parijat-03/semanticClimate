Corporations are apparatuses of human creation and human organization. In so far as they involve humans organizing human activity then, yes, corporate ecocide is a plainly an anthropogenic problem. The history I point to is a human history and I blame the current climate crisis on <italic>human</italic> agency. Not any old human agency, but the emergence of European mercantilism based on colonialism and racial capitalism (Banaji <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). In so far as the history of the European nation state and the Christian church does not feature centrally in the book&#8217;s analysis, Fajardo is absolutely right. This is an incomplete anthropogenic approach, and thus would be a crucial addendum to understanding the history of corporate ecocide.</p>
