Adaptation describes &#8220;actions that countries will need to take to respond to the impacts of climate change that are already happening &#8230; (as well as future actions) &#8230; that can reduce our vulnerability to climate change impacts (e.g. investing in flood prevention practices)&#8221; (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018a</xref>). Mitigation refers to actions that directly decrease &#8220;the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere&#8221; and indirectly reduce &#8220;the current concentration of greenhouse gas emissions by enhancing sinks (e.g., increasing the area of forests)&#8221; (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2018b</xref>). While both of these climate change action types are important, it is important to disaggregate climate mitigation investment flows from climate adaptation because the climate mitigation finance is so heavily tilted toward cities and urban regions in developed countries away from rural communities and regions in the developing world, where adaptation finance is the key to address community-based solution, particularly in the context of sub-Saharan African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa as a region does not, ironically, emit enough greenhouse gas emissions to benefit from most climate mitigation projects.</p>
