Over the last 30 years, scientific consensus has emerged on the near- and far-term impacts of climate change. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analysis on the impact of 1.5&#176;C warming<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and on climate change and land<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> provides evidence for the climate-related risks for natural and human systems. As mean global temperatures rise to and beyond 1.5&#176;C, the likely impacts on the biodiversity of terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems worsen; likewise, risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, and human security increase.</p>
