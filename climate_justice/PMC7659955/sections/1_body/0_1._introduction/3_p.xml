In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-sensors-20-05977">Section 3</xref>, attention is drawn to climate-smart agriculture, with specific reference to what makes up the concept, a few challenges in its framework, as well as the latest progress in its development. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-sensors-20-05977">Section 4</xref> describes the challenges created by the interplay of adopting CSA in smart villages, and also tries to answer the research question. The section also conceptualizes climate-smartness, as it influences sustainable development of smart villages. Finally, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-sensors-20-05977">Section 5</xref> describes future research directions in smart-village and smart agricultural research, and draws relevant policy recommendations and conclusions</p>
