Extension is poised to expand, and as it does, it must be reoriented to address problems in new ways, ways that lay the groundwork for a just transition, embedding it in social relationships, engaging communities directly, and working to ensure that the transition is as deep, egalitarian, and democratic as possible. This involves new thinking and engaging new voices at various levels. This is a historic, even world-historic, opportunity for Extension to build on current work to develop a robust and multidimensional public sector response tantamount to the challenges we face.</p>
