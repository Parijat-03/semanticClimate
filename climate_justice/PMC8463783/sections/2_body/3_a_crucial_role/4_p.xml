Using the reduced complexity climate model MAGICC6 ("Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change Version 6"), we examined changes in global mean temperature up till now and in the future under the RCP2.6 emission scenario&#8212;the only emission pathway that aligns with the Paris agreement&#8212;but assumed that ecosystems on land had stopped absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> from 1900 onwards. In such a world, global temperatures would have risen much faster (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>, red line). In fact, we would have already crossed the 1.5 &#176;C threshold, demonstrating that terrestrial ecosystems have reduced warming by at least 0.4 &#176;C since 1900. Furthermore, if ecosystems on land cease to be a net carbon sink, this would lead to a dramatically higher rate of global warming compared with the standard RCP2.6 climate simulation that assumes intact land (and ocean) carbon sinks during the 21st century (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>, blue line). By 2100, global mean temperature would be moving decisively toward 3 &#176;C warming, even if the rapid decarbonization actions assumed in the RCP2.6 scenario pathway were fully implemented&#8212;and this is without even <italic toggle="yes">considering</italic> that rising temperatures would begin to release the vast biosphere carbon stocks themselves.</p>
