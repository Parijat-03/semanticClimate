The need for new formulations and frameworks &#8211; focusing on natural resources and resilience governance &#8211; will help get rid of the environmental-economic-social trade-off (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Griggs et&#160;al., 2014</xref>). In this interplay, the planning of selected sectors will be a determinant. This is the case for the sustainable built environment, for which smart cities and sustainable communities, sustainable design and construction of infrastructure and the provision of renewable energy technology will be decisive &#8211; among others (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Opoku, 2016</xref>). Supporting financial innovation and new typologies of financial instruments &#8211; such as equity-based crowdfunding and FinTech tools &#8211;, public policies can re-design and stimulate the entrepreneurial ecosystems and align them with SDGs (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gatto, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cicchiello, 2019</xref>). Environmental and institutional achievements &#8211; along with socioeconomic targets &#8211; will pass through the enforcement of management and governance standards. This may include <italic>inter alia</italic> the provision of implementation, monitoring and finance requisites (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Georgeson and Maslin, 2018</xref>).</p>
