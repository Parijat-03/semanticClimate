Changes in their <em>emissions</em> can also induce long-term <em><a href="#climate">climate</a></em> effects via, in particular, their interactions with some biogeochemical cycles. SLCFs are classified as direct or indirect, with direct SLCFs exerting climate effects through their <em><a href="#radiative_forcing">radiative forcing</a></em> and indirect SLCFs being the <em>precursors</em> of other direct climate forcers. Direct SLCFs include <em><sub>4</sub>)<a href="#methane">methane (CH</a></em>, <em><sub>3</sub>)<a href="#ozone">ozone (O</a></em>, primary <em><a href="#aerosol">aerosols</a></em> and some halogenated species. Indirect SLCFs are precursors of ozone or secondary aerosols. SLCFs can be cooling or warming through interactions with radiation and clouds. They are also referred to as near-term climate forcers. Many SLCFs are also air pollutants. A subset of exclusively warming SLCFs is also referred to as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), including methane, ozone, and <em><a href="#black_carbon">black carbon (BC)</a></em>.</p></div></dd><div>
