<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Low-income Muslim women are doubly excluded through their gender and through their low-income status. Although the RDRS and its outreach platform, the Kalipara Union Federation, are theoretically open to low-income households, in reality, the majority are unable to meet the minimum targeting criteria for training in wheat&#8211;maize innovations. Female and male low-income respondents expressed frustration and disappointment, reiterating that they want to try the innovations but do not receive training and support and do not have sufficient money to invest on their own account. They acknowledged that some poor farmers are risk-averse but argued that &#8220;many poor farmers are motivated and inspired by the new practices; the absence of support is a barrier&#8221; (interview with a participant). However, findings show that some low-income women and men have succeeded in raising themselves and their households out of deep poverty over a period of several years through determination, hard work, training in innovations like vegetable gardening and the respect and support of in-laws. This has enabled a few men to be selected for RDRS training courses on wheat&#8211;maize innovations.</p>
