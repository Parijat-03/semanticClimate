In this way, the PPP nexus is reformulated in such a way as to legitimize centralized institutional power for corporate food. As such, it is the foundation and model of a new <italic>global economic contract</italic> premised on override of the social contract as the reciprocal rights of citizens and governments in national territories. The ultimate vision of &#8216;food access&#8217; accompanying this contract resembles the World Bank&#8217;s 1986 definition of food security as &#8216;the ability to purchase food&#8217; (Jarosz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>: 51). This suggests that the &#8216;stakeholders&#8217; distinguished by the UN/WEF alliance are those that have voice within a capital logic at large, via a narrative identifying wholesale commodification of food systems as the key to feeding the world. Those who produce and reproduce territorial foodstuffs via local and national markets do not have a substantive seat at the table, as they share seed, work communally, and tend to identify farming wealth less as a market benefit, and more as a socio-ecological resource and virtue (van der Ploeg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>; Patel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>).</p>
