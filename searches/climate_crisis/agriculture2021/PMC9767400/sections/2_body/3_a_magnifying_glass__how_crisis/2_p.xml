Indeed, their lack of or limited access to and control over productive resources, lack of capital and credit, the constraints they face in terms of travelling, and their limited opportunities to move into other means of livelihood puts them in an extremely vulnerable position when crises hit. Furthermore, crises often pile extra burden on women in regard to their reproductive tasks (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">CARE, 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">UNDP, 2016</xref>). All these challenges have been evident in previous and ongoing crises: past food crises, the ongoing climate change crisis and the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
