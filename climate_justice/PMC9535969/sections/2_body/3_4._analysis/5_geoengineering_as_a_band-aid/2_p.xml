Participants explicitly voiced that geoengineering would deviate attention from &#8216;real solutions&#8217;, portraying it as a &#8216;techno fix&#8217; that could never solve environmental and climate issues. As put by some participants, who voiced ecofeminist perspectives, geoengineering reproduces the same techno-scientific paradigm of dominating nature. For them, tackling climate change requires an abolition of the idea of separation between Humanity and Nature:<disp-quote><p>With geoengineering we are giving priority to a paradigm of control and intervention over nature. (HC &#8211; Group I)</p><p>[Geoengineering] would perpetuate something that has already been shown not to be sustainable as humanity (.&#8196;.&#8196;.) we are going to invest in something that once again represents dissociation between us and nature.
