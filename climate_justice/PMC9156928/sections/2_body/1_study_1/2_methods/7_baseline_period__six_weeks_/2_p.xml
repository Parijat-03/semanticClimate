<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For the first six weeks, the Qualtrics surveys received by the participants contained a &#8216;climate events bulletin&#8217;, consisting of a list of events happening in the next 3&#8211;4 days, held by our partner climate organizations (San Diego 350 and UCSD Green New Deal) (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">b</italic>). At the top of the bulletin, participants were reminded that while they were required to scroll to the end of the list, they were not required to attend these events (there was no financial penalty for not attending). To ensure that participants read the events bulletin, they were asked two attention-check questions at the end of each bulletin about the events. Responding incorrectly to more than one question potentially resulted in a $3 penalty for that session ($3 were subtracted from the final payment of $100); however, the participant who failed this check could read the bulletin once more and re-take the test to avoid losing the $3.</p>
