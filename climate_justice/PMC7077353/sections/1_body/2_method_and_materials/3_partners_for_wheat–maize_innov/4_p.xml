<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Male trainers from RDRS come to the Union Federation to train women in wheat&#8211;maize innovations (and other technologies). The personal link between RDRS and the Union Federation is the president of the Union Federation. When women farmers have queries about wheat&#8211;maize innovations, they approach Joytee who provides expert opinion and solicits assistance from the RDRS, if required. Women are also free to approach RDRS directly, but in most cases they will do so with the knowledge and support of Joytee.</p>
