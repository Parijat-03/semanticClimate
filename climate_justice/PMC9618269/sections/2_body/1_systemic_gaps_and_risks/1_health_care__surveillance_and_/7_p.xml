This will lead to an exponential increase in diseases and illnesses globally, especially in Africa. For instance, malaria is the second leading cause of death in Nigeria only surpassed by neonatal disorders (Vos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>). WHO report shows that in Africa, malaria cases and mortality rates spiked from 56 in 2019 to 60 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2020 (World Health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2021</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that the extension of the geographical range of malaria vectors is dependent on the level of local warming and the ecology of the vectors. In addition, Pu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>) claimed that temperature and changes in humidity owing to climate change are engendering severe evolutionary changes in various animal species, such as agricultural pests and disease vectors. These evolutionary changes are apparent as the alterations in allele frequencies of genes that are implied in thermotolerance and desiccation resistance.</p>
