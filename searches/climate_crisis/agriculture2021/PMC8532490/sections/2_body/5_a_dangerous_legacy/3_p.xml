MSIs allow corporations to join together with governments, corporate-friendly actors (including corporate philanthropies, CSOs academics and &#8216;expert&#8217; agencies) and vulnerable, marginalized groups in voluntary processes/platforms to &#8216;solve&#8217; problems that they have a large part in creating. MSIs come up with a raft of &#8216;solutions&#8217; that can include standards, techno-fixes, behavior change models, incentives for the private sector, conflict mediation processes, etc., but do not address human rights abuses and climate and environmental offenses arising from corporate operations, impunity and lack of corporate and state accountability. Using the language of participation and inclusivity, MSIs blur the lines between rights-holders (peoples), duty-bearers (states) and other stakeholders, while keeping intact power asymmetries and erasing mechanisms of legal accountability and justice.</p>
