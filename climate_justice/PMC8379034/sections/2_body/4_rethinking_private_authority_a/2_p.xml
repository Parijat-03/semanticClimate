According to Green (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>), there are two types of private authority operating in the climate change governance arena. In the first type, states delegate authority to private actors, which Green refers to as &#8220;delegated private authority,&#8221; in which the state in the form of say the UNFCCC &#8220;delegates&#8221; the governance of Kyoto Protocol&#8217;s Clean Development Mechanism to private actors. In the second type, business actors generate their own rules and persuade actors and institution to adopt them. In what Green refers to as &#8220;entrepreneurial state authority&#8221; (Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref> p. 4&#8211;5), private actors create climate change and other sustainability governance rules without an explicit delegation of authority from states. Forest Stewardship Council&#8217;s sustainable forestry standards and the U.S. Green Building Council&#8217;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system are both examples of such &#8220;entrepreneurial state authority.&#8221;</p>
