The first wave was dominated by interventions in journals such as <italic toggle="yes">Urban Studies</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Environment and Urbanization</italic> (which published 32 and 49 papers, respectively), in dialogue with other journals in critical urban studies (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</italic>) and development studies (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Habitat International</italic>). This work most often adopted a critical angle and emphasized cross&#8208;cutting themes, such as urban informality and vulnerability. Following the second wave we have seen a shift towards journals with a focus on providing workable alternatives beyond the critique, such as <italic toggle="yes">Cities</italic> and the <italic toggle="yes">Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning</italic>, while at the same time, the variety of outlets for cities and climate change work has diversified into fields as varied as environmental economics, spatial planning, and environmental law.</p>
