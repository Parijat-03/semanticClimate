<p>Floyd&#8217;s murder invigorated a Black Lives Matter movement to epic proportions and duration, with an influx of white participants and demonstrations even in conservative cities and towns across the nation. Many are becoming aware for the first time of the effects of systemic racism. Jelani Cobb, historian and professor of journalism at Columbia University, calls for a &#8216;gigantic, systemic overhaul&#8217; in much of our country, saying you&#8217;re never going to have pristine policing as long as &#8216;you have bad housing, bad education, poor quality of employment, [and] low&#8208;wage work&#8217; (Cobb&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). He sees the relationship between police and the African American communities as a gauge for race relations in general. &#8216;Police departments bear a disproportionate burden because whenever something is happening overwhelmingly it&#8217;s in response to police use of force. People react and it detonates racial tensions that were there before&#8217; (ibid. 2020). Cobb was surprised when he went into Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 after the riots following the murder of Michael Brown: people wanted to talk about schools, excessive teen suspensions, unemployment, poor housing and institutional disparities. He went on to say you can&#8217;t understand Floyd outside of COVID&#8208;19 and the disproportionate number of people of colour succumbing to the virus; a deadly consequence of the cumulative effect of racial biases (ibid. 2020).</p>
