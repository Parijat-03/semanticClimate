However, the relative role of each of these sources of uncertainty differs between the global and the regional scales as well as between variables and also between different regions (Lehner et&#160;al., 2020). One way to address the internal variability and model uncertainties is to consider results from both multiple models and multiple realizations of the same model (Eyring et&#160;al., 2016a; Lehner et&#160;al., 2020; D&#237;az et&#160;al., 2021). These models are at times also combined with different weights that are a&#160;function of their performance and independence to increase the confidence of the multi-model ensemble (Abramowitz et&#160;al., 2019; Brunner et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="570.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="570.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.51; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Other elements that play a&#160;role are the inconsistency between the global and regional models in dynamical downscaling or the observational and methodological uncertainty in bias-adjustment methods (S&#248;rland et&#160;al., 2018). These elements, in addition to those typical of the uncertainty in global and large-scale phenomena (Chapters 1&#8211;9), affect the overall confidence of regional climate information. This complex scene with different sources of uncertainty makes the collection of results available from multi-model, multi-member simulations most useful when synthesized through a&#160;distillation process (Section&#160;10.5.3).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="279.85" top="426.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 426.48; y1: 436.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="426.48" x1="279.85">10.1.4 Distillation of Regional Climate Information</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="402.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="402.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional climate information is synthesized from different lines of evidence from a&#160;number of sources (Sections 10.2&#8211;10.4) taking into account the context of a&#160;user vulnerable to climate variability and change at regional scales (Baztan et&#160;al., 2017) and the values of all relevant actors (Corner et&#160;al., 2014; Bessette et&#160;al., 2017) in a&#160;process called distillation (Section&#160;10.5). Distillation, understood as the process&#160;of synthesizing information about climate change from different lines of evidence obtained from a&#160;variety of sources and taking into account the user context and the values of all relevant actors, allows the connection of global climate change to the local and regional scales, where adaptation responses and policy decisions take place. Climate information is translated into the user context in a&#160;co-production process that introduces further user-relevant elements leading to user-relevant climate information (Figure&#160;10.1; Pettenger, 2016; Verrax, 2017) for a&#160;specific demand like, for instance, guiding climate-resilient development (Kruk et&#160;al., 2017; Parker and Lusk, 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="198.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="198.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 198.6; y1: 208.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The approaches adopted in the distillation of regional climate information are diverse and range from the simple delivery of data as information to co-production with the user using as many lines of evidence as possible (Louren&#231;o et&#160;al., 2016). The availability and selection of the sources and the approach followed has implications for the usefulness of the information. For instance, it is well-established that it is invalid to take a&#160;time series from a&#160;gridcell of a&#160;model simulation as equivalent to an observational estimate of a&#160;point within the cell, due to the lack of representativeness (Section&#160;10.3), and consequently the information building solely on this type of data source is of limited use. Relevant decisions are made during the distillation process, such as what method is most suitable to a&#160;specific user context and the question being addressed. </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.3" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.3" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.78; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">data, a&#160;set of user-oriented indicators, a&#160;set of figures and maps with either a&#160;brief description, in the form of a&#160;storyline, or formulated as rich and complex climate adaptation plans. The information typically includes a&#160;description of the sources and assumptions, estimates of the associated uncertainty and its sources, and guidance to prevent possible misunderstandings in its communication.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="630.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="630.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 630.6; y1: 640.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The choices made for the distillation have typically been part of a&#160;linear supply chain, starting from the access to climate data that are transformed into maps or derived climate data products, and finally formulating statements that are communicated and delivered to a&#160;broad range of users (Hewitt et&#160;al., 2012; Hewitson et&#160;al., 2017). This methodology has proven to be valuable in many cases, but it is equally fraught with dangers of not communicating important assumptions, not estimating the impact of relevant uncertainties, and possibly causing misunderstandings in the handover to the user community. This has led to the emergence of new pathways to generate user-oriented climate information, many in the context of emerging climate services (Buontempo et&#160;al., 2018; Hewitt et&#160;al., 2020), which are assessed in Section&#160;10.5 and in Chapter&#160;12.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="483.7" top="450.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.41; y0: 450.48; y1: 460.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="450.48" x1="483.7">10.1.5 Regional Climate Information  in the AR6&#160;WGI&#160;Report</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.29" top="414.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="414.6" x1="563.29" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">This chapter is part of a&#160;cluster devoted to regional climate (Chapters&#160;10, 11, 12 and Atlas).

Chapter&#160;12 identifies elements of the climate system relevant for sectoral impacts referred to as climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), assesses past and future evolutions of sector-relevant CIDs for each AR6 region, synthesizes such evolutions for different time periods and by GWL, and assesses how CIDs are used in climate services. The Atlas assesses observed, attributed and projected changes in mean climate, performs a&#160;comparison of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations, evaluates downscaling performance and assesses approaches to communicate climate information. The Interactive Atlas facilitates the exploration of datasets assessed in all chapters through a&#160;wide range of maps, graphs and tables generated in an interactive manner. This allows for the comparison of changes at warming levels and scenario/time-period combinations, display of&#160;indices for extremes and CIDs, and serves all chapters in the report to facilitate synthesis information and support the Technical Summary and the Summary for Policymakers.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="78.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="78.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Other chapters also include a&#160;strong regional component and provide context for the assessment of regional climate.
