Notably, but far from exclusively, through drought and unsustainable overdraft of groundwater in arid and semi-arid regions, the agricultural and food production on which billions of people are directly dependent is increasingly threatened. Many of these populations are already chronically malnourished and could face famine due to extreme poverty, displacement, climate change, and local conflicts. At the same time attempts to increase agricultural productivity using current approaches will further degrade biodiversity and increase emissions leading to further global warming.</p>
