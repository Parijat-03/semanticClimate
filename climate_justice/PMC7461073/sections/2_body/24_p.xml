<bold>Tessa:</bold> There are several things the UK government needs to do. The first thing is to get its own house in order &#8211; it's hard to see how it can be a credible leader in climate diplomacy without that. We know that the UK government is way off track<xref rid="newe12203-note-0012" ref-type="fn">

</xref> of what is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and certainly what many calling for climate justice would consider fair. The UK also needs to start accounting for emissions that may fall outside of the formal Paris accounting framework &#8211; like emissions embedded in imports and associated with international aviation and shipping &#8211; but which in reality drive climate change just as much as any other emissions. The second thing it needs to prioritise, especially given the global economic crisis, is climate finance. Rich countries have promised to mobilise $100 billion a year to help poorer countries both decarbonise their economies and protect themselves from the impacts of climate change, which are hitting them first and worst. Governments are nowhere close to meeting that goal, despite the incredibly strong moral, political and legal imperative to do so.</p>
