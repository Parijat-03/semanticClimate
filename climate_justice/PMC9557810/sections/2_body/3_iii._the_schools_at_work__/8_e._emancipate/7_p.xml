<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CISCSA&#8217;s feminist school explicitly employs emancipatory pedagogies that valorize
situated experiences as opportunities to reclaim the city, and align with Sara
Motta&#8217;s call to <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;deconstruct subordinated and naturalised social and
spatial relations, while looking at gender, race, age, class, sexual
orientation and mental and physical ability as one&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn41-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">41</xref>)</sup> These
emancipatory pedagogic practices work through power and consciousness-raising,
acknowledging the existence of oppression, as well as the possibility of ending
it, and foregrounding the desire and capacity for social transformation. These
practices manifest through the use of open &#8211; non-predetermined &#8211; learning
strategies that encourage participants to share in a safe space their own
intersectional positionalities and experiences with those of others through
written, spoken and visual reflections.</p>
