There are number of reasons for the slow pace of extension of new health outlets such as non-availability of land, shortage of manpower and multiplicity of agencies etc. Moreover all the hospitals especially major hospitals in Delhi are overcrowded because of heavy patient load.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="286.53" top="504.96"><span x0="72.02" y0="504.96" x1="286.53" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 504.96; y1: 516.96; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi&#8217;s bed-population ratio is 2.73 beds per 1,000 population which is better as compared to the national average of one per 1,000. Though the situation of health services in Delhi is much better than in other states, there are certain areas which require attention. This includes provision of health services to the large and rapidly growing urban poor habitations in the city which include JJ clusters, unauthorized colonies, resettlement colonies and pavement dwellers which have very poor access to health services. The hospitals in Delhi also cater to a large number of patients from other states. It is estimated that nearly 33 per cent of the load in secondary facilities in Delhi is from neighboring states. This leads to further strain on the existing infrastructure in the city. Further, while some facilities and schemes are managed by the Govt. of Delhi, some are managed by the Urban Local Bodies. Therefore, there is a need to have an integrated and coordinated approach to regulate and strengthen the health sector in Delhi through the realignment of existing structure and procedures for better synergisation of available resources. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.09" top="159.67"><span x0="72.02" y0="159.67" x1="526.09" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 159.67; y1: 171.67; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There is need for inter sectoral coordination between the environment department, health department, civic authorities, food and civil supplies and urban development departments for the success of the programme.
