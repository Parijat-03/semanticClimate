The recommendations for prevention of spread of disease and treatment were ambiguous and at times&#8212;conflicting&#8212;early in the pandemic. Emerging knowledge and development of an effective vaccine will galvanize our future public health response and amplify current public health recommendations aimed at limiting the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Similarly, fostering a unified message and a comprehensive public health approach to address the crisis of climate change and associated health consequences also requires persistence by public health nurses in addressing the needs of individuals, families, communities, and populations in the face of this complex intersection of COVID&#8208;19 and climate change.</p>
