Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>: 655&#8211;656) argues that MBMs are used to avoid discussions of &#8220;alternative socio-ecological relations based on a democratic decision-making process related to the production of use values&#8221;. MBMs serve to render invisible alternative socioeconomic approaches such as degrowth (Hickel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>), which would require democratic decisions of how to organise resources in alternative ways, at least partly outside the market system or providing strong direction to markets. This again links Felli&#8217;s work with Sandel, as one of Sandel&#8217;s key arguments is that MBMs are used to avoid democratic and societal discussion and decisions on how to deal with problematic or scarce but socially important goods and services. Using MBMs is attractive to policymakers because it allows them to avoid difficult decisions, but it leads instead to corruption and unfairness and ultimately these depoliticised and dysfunctional negotiations act as a discourse of climate delay.</p>
