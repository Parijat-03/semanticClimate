Therefore, it is important to consider the &#8220;intrinsic relationship between transport and transformation&#8221; (Neubert &amp; Schabacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>: 25), as well as its impact on mobile and immobile practices, spaces, and relations. The lagoon is both a&#160;fragile ecosystem and a&#160;central waterway. Due to its environmental problems after decades of industrial use, as well as the divergent interests that are involved in it, it is a&#160;highly contested space. Similar to historical developments, current discussions show that traffic routes are not adapted to nature but that nature adapts to traffic routes (Fackler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Mathieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>). Although ships of over 25,000 tons do not pass through the Giudecca Canal anymore, the <italic>Comitato</italic> continues its fight to keep cruise ships out of the lagoon. The debate especially revolves around future locations of new cruise terminals and routes for super-size ships. Whether these will be located inside the lagoon or not is a&#160;central point of discussion, and the search for a&#160;solution dominates daily headlines. In the meantime, the authorities decided on temporary solution by using landing places in Marghera which the <italic>Comitato</italic> calls &#8220;a&#160;farce&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref> and regards as unsustainable.</p>
