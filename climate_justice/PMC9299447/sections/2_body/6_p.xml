The article examines the intersection of mental health, climate change, children and young people and climate activism in WA. We explore the mental health impacts of climate change on children and young people, and youth climate activism as a resilience strategy. In Box&#160;<xref rid="jpc15649-fea-0003" ref-type="boxed-text">3</xref>, youth climate activist co&#8208;authors then discuss opportunities to support the mental health of young people compelled to take climate action. We argue for structural change to address the causes of the climate crisis, alongside enhanced mental health evidence and approaches to appropriately support children and young people affected by climate change. Furthermore, we support the call of Aboriginal peoples to ensure culturally appropriate, place&#8208;based frameworks and programs based in caring for Country.</p>
