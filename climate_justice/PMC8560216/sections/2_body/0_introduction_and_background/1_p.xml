The environmental podcast <italic>Breaking Green Ceilings</italic> is used as a case study to demonstrate a way to explain and propose solutions to the persistent challenges that environmentalists from historically underrepresented communities often face in mainstream environmental organizations and media. Another goal of the podcast is to share stories that often are not covered in education systems and by mainstream media.</p>
