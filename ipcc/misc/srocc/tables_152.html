      <td>Exchanges of GHGs between the land and the atmosphere are referred to as &#8216;biogeochemical interactions&#8217; (Section 2.3), which\nare driven mainly by the balance between photosynthesis and respiration by plants, and by the decomposition of soil organic matter by\nmicrobes. The conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic compounds by plant photosynthesis, known as terrestrial net\nprimary productivity, is the source of plant growth, food for human and other organisms, and soil organic carbon. Due to strong\nseasonal patterns of growth, northern hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems are largely responsible for the seasonal variations in global\natmospheric CO concentrations. In addition to CO , soils emit methane (CH ) and nitrous oxide (N O) (Section 2.3). Soil temperature\n2 2 4 2\nand moisture strongly affect microbial activities and resulting fluxes of these three GHGs.</td>

      <td>Much like fossil fuel emissions, GHG emissions from anthropogenic land cover change and land management are &#8216;forcers&#8217; on\nthe climate system. Other land-based changes to climate are described as &#8216;feedbacks&#8217; to the climate system &#8211; a process by which\nclimate change influences some property of land, which in turn diminishes (negative feedback) or amplifies (positive feedback)\nclimate change. Examples of feedbacks include the changes in the strength of land carbon sinks or sources, soil moisture and\nplant phenology (Section 2.5.3).</td>

      <td>Incorporating these land&#8211;climate processes into climate projections allows for increased understanding of the land&#8217;s response\nto climate change (Section 2.2), and to better quantify the potential of land-based response options for climate change mitigation\n(Section 2.6). However, to date Earth system models (ESMs) incorporate some combined biophysical and biogeochemical processes\nonly to limited extent and many relevant processes about how plants and soils interactively respond to climate changes are still\nto be included (Section 2.7). And even within this class of models, the spread in ESM projections is large, in part because of their\nvarying ability to represent land&#8211;climate processes (Hoffman et al. 2014). Significant progress in understanding of these processes\nhas nevertheless been made since AR5.</td>
