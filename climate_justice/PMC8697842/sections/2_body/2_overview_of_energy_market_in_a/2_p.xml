According to the IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) database, oil consumption in Australia increased from 28,994 to 43,644 ktoe between 1990 and 2017. Hence, the share of oil in total energy consumption was calculated as 51.2% and 53.3% for the years 1990 and 2017, respectively. As stated by the EIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>), Australia&#8217;s oil production has drastically declined since 2000. Resultantly, the country&#8217;s oil import dependence has increased. Australia mainly imports oil products from Singapore and South Korea, whereas other supplies include Japan, China, and India (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p>
