The use of the harvested carbon in either long-lived wood products (e.g.,&#160;for construction), short-lived wood products (e.g., pulp and paper), or biofuels affects the net carbon balance of the forest sector (Lempri&#232;re et al. 2013; Matthews et al. 2018). The use of these wood products can further contribute to GHG emission-reduction goals by avoiding the emissions from the products with higher embodied emissions that have been displaced (Nabuurs et al. 2007; Lempri&#232;re et al. 2013). In 2007 the IPCC concluded that&#160;&#8216;[i]n the long term, a&#160;sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, &#64257;bre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation bene&#64257;t&#8217; (Nabuurs et al. 2007). The apparent trade-offs between maximising forest carbon stocks and maximising ecosystem carbon sinks are at the origin of ongoing debates about optimum management strategies to achieve negative emissions (Keith et al. 2014; Kurz et al. 2016; Lundmark et al. 2014). SFM, including the intensi&#64257;cation of carbon-focused management strategies, can make long-term contributions towards negative emissions if the sustainability of management is assured through appropriate governance, monitoring and enforcement. As speci&#64257;ed in the de&#64257;nition of SFM, other criteria such as biodiversity must also be considered when assessing mitigation outcomes (Lecina-Diaz et al. 2018). Moreover, the impacts of changes in management on albedo and other non-GHG factors also need to be considered (Luyssaert et al. 2018) (Chapter&#160;2). The contribution of SFM for negative emissions is strongly affected by the use of the wood products derived from forest harvest and the time horizon over which the carbon balance is assessed. SFM needs to anticipate the impacts of climate change on future tree growth, mortality and disturbances when designing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies (Valade et al. 2017; Seidl et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="259.1" top="339.42"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.11; y0: 339.42; y1: 349.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="339.42" x1="259.1">1.8.5 Policy responses to land degradation</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.93" top="315.52"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 315.52; y1: 325.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="315.52" x1="312.93">The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, recognised land degradation as a&#160;major challenge to sustainable development, and led to the establishment of the UNCCD, which speci&#64257;cally addressed land degradation in the drylands. The UNCCD emphasises sustainable land use to link poverty reduction on one hand and environmental protection on the other. The two other &#8216;Rio Conventions&#8217; emerging from the UNCED&#160;&#8211; the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)&#160;&#8211; focus on climate change and biodiversity, respectively. The land has been recognised as an aspect of common interest to the three conventions, and SLM is proposed as a&#160;unifying theme for current global efforts on combating land degradation, climate change and loss of biodiversity, as well as facilitating land-based adaptation to climate change and sustainable development. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.94" top="135.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 135.55; y1: 145.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="135.55" x1="312.94">The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) funds developing countries to undertake activities that meet the goals of the conventions and deliver global environmental bene&#64257;ts.

It is understood that the root causes of land degradation and successful adaptation will not be realised until holistic solutions to land management are explored.

This is an illustration of how extremely important soils are for addressing climate change. The initiative is based on eight steps: stop carbon loss (priority #1 is peat soils); promote carbon uptake; monitor, report and verify impacts; deploy technology for tracking soil carbon; test strategies for implementation and upscaling; involve communities; coordinate policies; and provide support (Rumpel et al. 2018). Questions remain, however, about the extent that the 4p1000 is achievable as a&#160;universal goal (van Groenigen et al. 2017; Poulton et al. 2018; Schlesinger and Amundson 2018).</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.46" top="399.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.3; y0: 399.54; y1: 409.04; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="399.54" x1="571.46">LDN was introduced by the UNCCD at Rio +20, and adopted at UNCCD COP12 (UNCCD 2016a). LDN is de&#64257;ned as &#8216;a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within speci&#64257;ed temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems&#8217;(Cowie et al. 2018). Pursuit of LDN requires effort to avoid further net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to a&#160;reference state, or baseline. LDN encourages a&#160;dual-pronged effort involving SLM to reduce the risk of land degradation, combined with efforts in land restoration and rehabilitation, to maintain or enhance land-based natural capital, and its associated ecosystem services (Orr et al. 2017; Cowie et al. 2018). Planning for LDN involves projecting the expected cumulative impacts of land-use and land management decisions, then counterbalancing anticipated losses with measures to achieve equivalent gains, within individual land types (where land type is de&#64257;ned by land potential). Under the LDN framework developed by UNCCD, three primary indicators are used to assess whether LDN is achieved by 2030: land cover change; net primary productivity; and soil organic carbon (Cowie et al. 2018; Sims et al. 2019). Achieving LDN therefore requires integrated landscape management that seeks to optimise land use to meet multiple objectives (ecosystem health, food security, human well-being) (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016). The response hierarchy of Avoid &gt;&#160;Reduce &gt;&#160;Reverse land degradation articulates the priorities in planning LDN interventions. LDN provides the impetus for widespread adoption of SLM and efforts to restore or rehabilitate land. Through its focus, LDN ultimately provides tremendous potential for mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change by halting and reversing land degradation and transforming land from a&#160;carbon source to a&#160;sink.
