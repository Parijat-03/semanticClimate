For the dominant narrative, the solution is to push for the formal recognition of existing land tenure, where land tenure security is essentially taken to mean the formal recognition of pre-existing access to land. There are two problems with this. On the one hand, not all compelling issues involving land are related to lack of recognition of existing tenure. For example, there are many who are landless or land-poor who need access to land, but for whom that land access is absent, or diminished, or degraded. Their status compels them to largely rely on selling their labour power, often cheaply, in order to survive. These are the world&#8217;s &#8216;precariat&#8217; (Standing, <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), &#8216;working people&#8217; (Shivji, <xref rid="CIT0093" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), or &#8216;classes of labour&#8217; (Bernstein, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), who number at least a billion (Davis, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Moreover, by 2020 there were 50.8 million reported internally displaced peoples (IDPs), of which 45.7 million were displaced due to conflict and violence, and 5.1 million due to disasters (NRC, <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Formal recognition of existing land tenure is not relevant to these landless and land-poor working people, but land redistribution and restitution are urgent priorities.</p>
