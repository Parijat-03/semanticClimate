There are global-scale scenarios of food security (Foley et al.&#160;2011; Pradhan et al.&#160;2013, 2014), but fewer scenarios of deserti&#64257;cation, land degradation and restoration (Wolff et al.&#160;2018). Exploratory scenarios combine qualitative &#8216;storylines&#8217; or descriptive narratives of the underlying causes (or drivers) of change (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000; Rounsevell and Metzger 2010; O&#8217;Neill et al.&#160;2014) with quantitative projections from computer models. Different types of models are used for this purpose based on very different modelling paradigms, baseline data and underlying assumptions (Alexander et al.&#160;2016a; Prestele et al.&#160;2016). Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box below outlines how a&#160;combination of models can quantify these components as well as the interactions between them. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.64" top="267.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.77; y0: 267.54; y1: 277.04; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="267.54" x1="557.64">Exploratory scenarios often show that socio-economic drivers have a larger effect on land-use change than climate drivers (Harrison&#160;et al.&#160;2014, 2016). Of these, technological development is critical in affecting the production potential (yields) of food and bioenergy and the feed conversion ef&#64257;ciency of livestock (Rounsevell et al.&#160;2006; Wise et al.&#160;2014; Kreidenweis et al.&#160;2018), as well as the area of land needed for food production (Foley et al.&#160;2011; Weindl et al.&#160;2017; Kreidenweis et al.&#160;2018). Trends in consumption, for example, diets or waste reduction, are also fundamental in affecting land-use change (Pradhan et al.&#160;2013; Alexander et al.&#160;2016b; Weindl et al.&#160;2017; Alexander et al.&#160;2017; Vuuren et al.&#160;2018; Baj&#382;elj et al.&#160;2014). Scenarios of land-based mitigation through large-scale bioenergy production and afforestation often lead to negative trade-offs with food security (food&#160;prices), water resources and biodiversity (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="159.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.76; y0: 159.55; y1: 169.05; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="159.55" x1="557.6">Many exploratory scenarios are based on common frameworks such as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Popp&#160;et al.&#160;2016; Riahi et al.&#160;2017; Doelman et al.&#160;2018)) (Section&#160;1.2).

SSP4 has large differences in income within and across world regions; it facilitates low-carbon economies in places, but limits adaptive capacity everywhere. SSP5 is a&#160;technologically advanced world with a&#160;strong economy that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, but with high adaptive capacity. SSP2 is an intermediate case between SSP1 and SSP3 (O&#8217;Neill et al.&#160;2014). The SSPs are commonly used with models to project future land-use change (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).</span></div><div left="323.34" right="571.74" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 323.34; x1: 327.56; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.34" y0="735.57" x1="571.74">The SSPs map onto the RCPs through shared assumptions. For example, a&#160;higher level of climate change (RCP8.5) is associated with higher challenges for climate change mitigation (SSP5). Not all SSPs are, however, associated with all RCPs. For example, an SSP5 world is committed to high fossil fuel use, associated GHG emissions, and this is not easily commensurate with lower levels of climate change (e.g.,&#160;RCP2.6). Engstrom et al. (2016) took this approach further by ascribing levels of probability that associate an SSP with an RCP, contingent on the SSP scenario assumptions (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).</span></div></body></html>
