In the aftermath of the First World War, for example, the economic arm of the League of Nations produced a significant degree of international cooperation, resulting in the 1927 World Economic Conference, which also included non-members, viz., the USA. The countries involved in the conference decided that it was time to terminate tariffs (League of Nations, 1927). However, with the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the USA in June 1930, countries switched from relatively free international trading systems to a high degree of protectionism in the wake of the economic fallout from 1929 stock market crash. Canada was the first nation to retaliate in May 1930, long before Smoot-Hawley was signed into law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Many other nations followed suit, raising tariffs and trade barriers against each other and the USA.</p>
