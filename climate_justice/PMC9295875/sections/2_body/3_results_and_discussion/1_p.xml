In the case of mitigations, the values of energy-mix case oscillated much higher than those of the non-energy-mix case, which starts in the 0<sup>th</sup> year as 0.0 of the relative value. In the case of global warming, the relative impact values are higher in the non-energy-mix case. So, global warming is mitigated when the energy-mix is performed. In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, the 9.875th year (=&#8201;9th year and 319th day) has the biggest difference between the two cases when energy-mix has the highest effect on the global warming aspect in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. So, it is analyzed that the case of energy-mix has about 1.86 times more impact on the global warming at the time of the highest effect point in this study. However, the results could be different which are based on variables in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. These variables are constructed by the expert&#8217;s judgments where the weighting factors could be considered based on the situations of the modeling. The 2nd time happens in the 32.25th year. It means that the energy-mix with non-carbon emission characteristics of nuclear energy shows a better effect on climate change.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Simulations of energy-mix study <bold>a</bold> mitigations, <bold>b</bold> pandemic, and <bold>c</bold> global warming</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10668_2022_2551_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig><fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The high differences between energy-mix and non-energy-mix case</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10668_2022_2551_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
