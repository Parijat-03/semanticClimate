The ideal of globally valid indicators for measuring SD exemplifies a techno-scientific norm at this level. Entities on the meso-level are nations and societies while relevant norms are accountability, cohesion, or national ownership. Entities on the micro-level are communities, individuals, and more generally subnational entities; an important norm here is moral responsibility.</p>
