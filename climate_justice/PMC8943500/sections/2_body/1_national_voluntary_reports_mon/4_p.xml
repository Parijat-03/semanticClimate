A current example of this is the conflict concerning the natural resources of S&#225;pmi (Persson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>; UNESCO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021b</xref>), where the S&#225;mi people, the only remaining indigenous people of the North of Europe lives. Is it possible to balance between a sustainable way of life guided by the S&#225;mi traditions and lifestyle and the investments proposed as a consequence of mitigating climate change in line with the current paradigm for economic growth? Is further mining, cutting of forest, building of industries and power plants in line with protecting cultural sustainability and/or biodiversity? Further dialogue and education around these issues are necessary.</p>
