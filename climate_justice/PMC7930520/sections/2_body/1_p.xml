Where contemporary analyses of the School Strikes for Climate movement&#160;risk suggesting that the strikes and these polarised responses are something new, Bessant insightfully draws attention to the historical continuities in contemporary debates and the &#8216;long-standing animus about the very idea that young people are, or could ever be, taken seriously as political agents&#8217; (p. 2). Recent polemic responses to young people&#8217;s political participation prompt Bessant to inquire into the historical constitution of &#8216;common sense&#8217; ways of understanding children and young people&#8217;s non/participation in politics, and into the &#8216;many inconsistencies that characterise official and popular thinking about young people and politics&#8217; (p. 13).</p>
