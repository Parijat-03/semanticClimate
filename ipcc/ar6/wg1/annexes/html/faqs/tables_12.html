During the shift from the last glacial period\nto the current interglacial, the total temperature increase was about 5&#176;C. That change took about 5000 years,\nwith a maximum warming rate of about 1.5&#176;C per thousand years, although the transition was not smooth. In\ncontrast, Earth&#8217;s surface has warmed approximately 1.1&#176;C since 1850&#8211;1900.
