Previous research has shown that CCA is positively correlated with a combined measures of MDD and GAD symptoms (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>) and with a general measure of mental health (Reyes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). The current study demonstrated that both cognitive emotional and functional impairment CCA subscales were significantly associated with GAD symptoms, but only CCA functional impairment was associated with higher MDD symptoms, suggesting that although there can be overlap in some functional impairment symptoms in CCA and MDD, the cognitive and emotional components are distinct. These results are consistent with a recent study examining feelings of anxiety, depression, and anger related to climate change that showed that feelings of anxiety related to climate change were associated with anxiety and stress symptoms, but not depression symptoms (Stanley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>). More generally, associations between CCA subscales and both GAD and MDD scales were not large, suggesting that CCA should not be viewed simply as a manifestation of GAD or MDD, nor as a clinical disorder.</p>
