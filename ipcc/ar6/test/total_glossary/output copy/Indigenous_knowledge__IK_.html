<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings.</p>
<p>For many indigenous peoples, IK informs decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions. This knowledge is integral to cultural complexes, which also encompass language, systems of classification, resource use practices, social interactions, values, ritual and spirituality. These distinctive ways of knowing are important facets of the worldâs cultural diversity (UNESCO, 2018).</p>
