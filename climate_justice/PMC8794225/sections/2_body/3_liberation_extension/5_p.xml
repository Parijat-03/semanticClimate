Building a movement for paradigmatic change requires creating a new common sense, expanding local alternatives, and building alliances for alternative visions. Liberation Extension can play a humble but important role in forging coalitions around common demands across lines of difference through education in service of transition. Leveraging community relationships, institutional knowledge, and expertise, Liberation Extension can help forge a new collective consciousness and speed up alliance building among a diverse range of working people, cultivating organizational and deliberative capacities while engaging communities in the task of building fair, healthy, and sustainable economic systems.</p>
