<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The FEEDS study is being implemented using a quasi-experimental design, which enables exploration of the links between environment, mental health, and food systems. The primary goal is to understand how early detection of climate change risks influences decision-making to improve management of solastalgia, food access and acquisition practices. The quasi-experimental design allows for the capture of natural experiments (ie, food system impacts resulting from environmental changes such as early ice road thaw) and pre- and posttests to assess the influence of specific climate change adaptation strategies. Pre- and posttests will include collecting data at baseline (before the implementation of a climate change preparedness or adaptation strategy) and at several time points after the implementation of a strategy. These data will elucidate changes in the knowledge or perceptions of community members about climate change impacts, changes in preparedness and adaptation behaviors, and specific effects of strategies on outcomes including food security status, food sovereignty, and solastalgia. Overall, this study design provides the flexibility required to adapt to emerging community needs over time.</p>
