The inclusion of young people in national delegations and national government institutions is generally also neither mandatory nor common.<sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Political quotas for young people apply in only a few countries, and many national governments limit themselves to selecting youth spokespersons and envoys.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
