<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This CCHH ECHO series proved to be highly satisfying for the vast majority of
health professionals who participated in the 8-week series. Strengths of the
CCHH ECHO include: (1) the large number of unique participants returning each
week from throughout the United States and abroad, (2) the bi-directional,
moderated question/answer sessions, (3) the simulated clinical climate change
cases, (4) the course certificate and community of practice options, and (5) the
benefits of a digital librarian. Some health professionals also identified areas
of improvement for this CCHH ECHO series. Suggestions included: allowing more
time for questions/answers, adding didactic presentations on climate and mental
health, sustainability and climate justice.</p>
