A few things are required for doing so. First, we must investigate whether the HDI can be reasonably translated to capabilities. Second, we must consider ways of non-arbitrarily establishing a threshold level for HDI (and capabilities). Third, and similarly to the second point, we must find a way to non-arbitrarily establish a ceiling for energy concumption per capita in relation to the HDI points.</p>
