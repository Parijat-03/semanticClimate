In this project IFAD co-invested with a private sector organic coconut processing company to develop a coconut value chain through a Public&#8211;Private-Producer (4P) partnership (Murphy &amp; Parry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). Coconut is being promoted as an alternative to rice since increasing salinity of irrigation water is making rice production infeasible. The private sector processor guaranteed they would purchase 100% of the organic coconut produced by participating farmers and also provided technical assistance in the production. Impact assessment of the project indicates the project did increase climate resilience of beneficiary households, especially with respect to saline intrusion, although there were cases where farmers preferred to retain their own marketing outlets rather than the project&#8217;s. Beneficiary households exposed to saline intrusion were able to shield losses to average value per capita, were less likely to realize very low crop value per capita, and were able to access more income sources, loans and transfers (Afonina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>).</p>
