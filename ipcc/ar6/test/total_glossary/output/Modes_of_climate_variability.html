<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Recurrent space-time structures of <em>natural variability</em> of the <em>climate system</em> with intrinsic spatial patterns, seasonality and time scales.</p>
<p>Modes can arise through the dynamical characteristics of the atmospheric circulation but also through coupling between the ocean and the <em>atmosphere</em>, with some interactions with land surfaces and <em>sea ice</em>. Many modes of variability are driven by internal climate processes and are a critical potential source of climate predictability on sub-seasonal to decadal time scales. See Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p>
