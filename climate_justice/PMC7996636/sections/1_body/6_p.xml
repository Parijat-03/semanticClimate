As countries and policymakers continue to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the focus will be on &#8216;building back better&#8217;. As part of this, WHO&#8217;s manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19 details six prescriptions to create a healthier society, more resilient to future outbreaks and epidemics (<xref rid="czaa165-B26" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020</xref>). One of these is the need to focus on investing in essential health services. To make this happen, HPSR is critical. But more broadly as the HPSR community rethinks and reconsiders HPSR in the post-COVID era (<xref rid="czaa165-B5" ref-type="bibr">Gilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), thinking beyond the &#8216;six health systems building blocks&#8217; and addressing climate change must be an integral part of the post-COVID-19 agenda.</p>
