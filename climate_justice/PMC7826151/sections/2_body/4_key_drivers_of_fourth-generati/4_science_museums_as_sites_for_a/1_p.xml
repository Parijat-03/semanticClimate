(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>) introduce the powerful notion of allyship in the (science) museum world, as a blueprint for attending to, and enacting, diversity and inclusive practices. The notion of allyship allows us to understand these institutions as contested sites, inclusive spaces, and again, as places for social well-being and transformation. In the context of science museums, allyship implies the following: understanding that it is not about themselves; practicing active listening, self-reflection, and learning; and a willingness/consciousness to be active and able to take direction (Ng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>). This is difficult work and includes a number of lived practices and experiences (Ng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>).</p>
