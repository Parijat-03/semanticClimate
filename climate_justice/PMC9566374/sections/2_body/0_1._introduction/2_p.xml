Many of their essential functions, such as research, epidemiological surveillance and health promotion and protection are essential for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In recent decades, public health services have already responded in specific ways to the different challenges posed by a changing climate. Examples include the 2003 heat wave in Europe that caused more than 50,000 excess deaths [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or the growth of the mosquito population which has led to the emergence or re-emergence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and various arboviruses (West Nile virus, dengue, Zika and chikungunya) [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ever-clearer link between these and other phenomena and climate change has given rise to the search for a more integrated approach. A more intersectoral response is therefore needed, with adaptation responses rooted in the local territory and mitigation policies that go beyond the local framework. Here too, public health has a key role to play in ensuring that the design and implementation of mitigation and adaptation policies include social and health co-benefits [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
