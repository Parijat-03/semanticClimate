Crops tend to grow most\noptimally within a suitable range of daily temperatures that is influenced by the varieties being cultivated and\nthe way the farm is managed. As daily temperatures rise above a &#8216;critical&#8217; temperature threshold, plants begin\nto experience heat stress that reduces growth and may lower resulting yields. If temperatures reach a higher\n&#8216;limiting&#8217; temperature threshold, crops may suffer leaf loss, pollen sterility, or tissue damage that can lead to\ncrop failure. Farmers typically select a cropping system with some consideration to the probability of extreme\ntemperature events that may occur within a typical season, and so identifying hot temperature thresholds helps\nfarmers select their seed and field management strategies as part of their overall risk management.

Likewise, increasing the height of a flood\nembankment protecting a given community can increase the level of river flow that may be tolerated without\nflooding, reducing the frequency of damaging floods. Stakeholders therefore benefit from climate services that\nare based on a co-development process, with scientists identifying system-relevant thresholds and developing\ntailored climatic impact-driver indices that represent these thresholds (FAQ 12.1). These thresholds help focus the\nprovision of action-relevant climate information for adaptation and risk management.</td>
