<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0220">The full set of papers in the VSI resonate with a feminist ethics of care, which, we believe, can make useful contributions to the thinking on transport and mobility justice as summarised in this editorial introduction. Adopting this ethics of care as a framework for justice implies a decisive moving away from distributive or liberal approaches to justice seen as right versus wrong (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Gilligan, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Sevenhuijsen, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Held, 2006</xref>) towards situated discussions of how &#8216;mobile moral subjects&#8217; are constituted and of the imbricated nature of movement, bodies, gender, environment and energy. As <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Sevenhuijsen (2003)</xref> suggests, caring entails a double and situated movement of <italic>recognition</italic> of the other and their needs (caring about) and of <italic>taking responsibility</italic> for supporting the fulfilment of those needs in a way that respects others' personhood (caring for). This double movement can underpin &#8216;caring justice&#8217; &#8211; an ongoing and dialogical negotiation characterised by openness, responsiveness, and commitment to multiple voices and needs. To an extent, this double movement has already animated the contributions to this VSI insofar that they have recognised and articulated mobility injustices and supported emergent forms of justice. It can, however, be developed further in future research.</p>
