Between 1999 and 2018, 8,909 died from extreme heat-related health causes in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Past heat-health impacts are numerous for the state of California as well. Between 1999 and 2009, there were 15 heat waves in California that together caused over 11,000 hospitalizations [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The 2006 heat wave alone sent 16,166 people to the emergency department, hospitalized 1,182 to 1,254 people, and took an estimated 160 to 505 lives [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reported heat-health morbidity and mortality figures are widely believed to be underestimates, particularly among workers [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the United States, it is projected that future heat wave events exacerbated by climate change will lead to anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands of excess-mortality deaths by the end of the century [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
