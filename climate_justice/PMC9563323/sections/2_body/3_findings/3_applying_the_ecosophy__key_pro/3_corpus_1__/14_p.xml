<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The overall depiction of <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic>, and particularly <italic toggle="yes">our customers</italic>, is that of the customer as a kind of dependent and the company as a kind of enabler. <italic toggle="yes">Customers</italic>, even in cases when they are technically described as agentic, are portrayed as achieving something beneficial for the environment or for the community only by virtue of the company&#8217;s providing the opportunity and means to &#8220;their&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">our</italic>) customers. Effective actions against ecological problems are, for <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic>, the acts of donating goods, purchasing goods, or appealing to the company to take particular courses of action on their behalf. Rather than being positioned as leaders or capable agents in themselves, (<italic toggle="yes">our</italic>) <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> are typically being <italic toggle="yes">helped</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">encouraged</italic> to make responsible choices, or in other cases <italic toggle="yes">supported</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">protected</italic>, reinforcing the imbalances of power and responsibility between customer and company, similar to that of a child and their parent or caregiver. We present a more detailed cognitive linguistic exploration of this <sc>corporation is a parent</sc> metaphor elsewhere (forthcoming), but for the purposes of this discussion about ecosophy-assisted corpus linguistics, we hope that this level of detail will suffice.</p>
