      <td>Previous IPCC reports have made reference to land and its role in the climate system. Threats to agriculture, forestry and other\necosystems, but also the role of land and forest management in climate change, have been documented since the IPCC Second\nAssessment Report, especially so in the Special Report on land use, land-use change and forestry (Watson et al. 2000). The IPCC Special\nReport on extreme events (SREX) discussed sustainable land management, including land-use planning, and ecosystem management\nand restoration among the potential low-regret measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range of future, climate\nchange scenarios. Low-regret measures are defined in the report as those with the potential to offer benefits now and lay the\nfoundation for tackling future, projected change. Compared to previous IPCC reports, the SRCCL offers a more integrated analysis of\nthe land system as it embraces multiple direct and indirect drivers of natural resource management (related to food, water and energy\nsecurities), which have not previously been addressed to a similar depth (Field et al. 2014a; Edenhofer et al. 2014).\nThe recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (SR15) targeted specifically the Paris Agreement, without exploring\nthe possibility of future global warming trajectories above 2&#176;C (IPCC 2018). Limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C compared to 2&#176;C\nis projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and to retain more of their services for people.\nIn many scenarios proposed in this report, large-scale land use features as a mitigation measure. In the reports of the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO), land degradation is discussed in relation to ecosystem goods and services, principally from a food\nsecurity perspective (FAO and ITPS 2015). The UNCCD report (2014) discusses land degradation through the prism of desertification.\nIt devotes due attention to how land management can contribute to reversing the negative impacts of desertification and land\ndegradation. The IPBES assessments (2018a, b, c, d, e) focus on biodiversity drivers, including a focus on land degradation and\ndesertification, with poverty as a limiting factor. The reports draw attention to a world in peril in which resource scarcity conspires\nwith drivers of biophysical and social vulnerability to derail the attainment of sustainable development goals. As discussed in Chapter\n4 of the SRCCL, different definitions of degradation have been applied in the IPBES degradation assessment (IPBES 2018b), which\npotentially can lead to different conclusions for restoration and ecosystem management.\nThe SRCCL complements and adds to previous assessments, whilst keeping the IPCC-specific &#8216;climate perspective&#8217;. It includes a focussed\nassessment of risks arising from maladaptation and land-based mitigation (i.e. not only restricted to direct risks from climate change\nimpacts) and the co-benefits and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives. As the SRCCL cuts across different policy sectors\nit provides the opportunity to address a number of challenges in an integrative way at the same time, and it progresses beyond other\nIPCC reports in having a much more comprehensive perspective on land.</td>
