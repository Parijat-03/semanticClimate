However, the link between decision scales and the spatial and temporal resolution of climate and related non-climatic, natural-system information is not straightforward, and failure to recognize mismatches between the two can undermine the effectiveness and relevance of the information (Cumming et&#160;al., 2006; Sayles, 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="630.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="630.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.51; y0: 630.6; y1: 640.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Nevertheless, the scale of regional climate information does not have to be the same as the decision scale. Physical-climate storylines (Box&#160;10.2) valid at large scales can be used to develop understanding that is relevant to local decisions. For example, global climate change affecting Antarctic ice-mass loss is relevant to formulating Dutch responses to sea level rise (Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2020). On the other hand, extreme precipitation processes can occur on scales of tens of kilometres and smaller and thus require high resolution climate information when projecting future changes (e.g.,&#160;Xie et&#160;al., 2015). An important factor for developing effective climate information using the distillation process is aligning the vulnerabilities of the social and economic systems under consideration ranging from, for example, those important to a&#160;farmer to those important to a&#160;national agricultural ministry (Andreassen et&#160;al., 2018; O&#8217;Higgins et&#160;al., 2019). Thus, more sophisticated matching of spatial and temporal resolution of climate information with decision scales requires engagement across a&#160;hierarchy of governance structures at national, regional and local level (e.g.,&#160;Lagabrielle et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="240.56" top="390.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 390.48; y1: 400.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="390.48" x1="240.56">10.5.3 Distillation of Climate Information</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="366.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="366.6" x1="304.77" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 366.6; y1: 376.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The preceding sections laid out the diversity of sources of climate information (Section&#160;10.5.1) and important elements for its use in a&#160;decision context (Section&#160;10.5.2). Here, it is assessed how context-relevant climate information can be distilled from these sources of information. Although the term distillation lacks a&#160;clear definition in the literature, it has, in principle, two aspects: the construction of (potentially user-targeted) information that is defensible and evidence-based (Giorgi, 2020), and the translation of this information into a&#160;specific context, targeting a&#160;specific purpose and set of values. The former typically involves data from multiple sources, including expert knowledge, and comprehensively considers relevant uncertainties to give physically plausible climate information. The latter translates the information explicitly into the user context, such as by linking it to experience, by formulating a&#160;narrative, by highlighting the relevance for the user context, or by putting the climate information into the context of the relevant non-climatic stressors.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.71" top="150.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="150.6" x1="304.71" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Distilling climate information for a&#160;specific purpose benefits from a&#160;co-production process that includes non-climate-scientists in the research design, analysis and the exploration and interpretation of the&#160;results to best place it in context of the intended application (Collins and Ison, 2009; Berkhout et&#160;al., 2013; Wildschut, 2017; Bhave et&#160;al., 2018; Dessai et&#160;al., 2018). Consideration of the specific contexts of information requirements by the provider as well as including the user values in connecting the science with users is increasingly recognized as paramount to construct information </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">et&#160;al., 2017; Vizy and Cook, 2017; Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Parker and Lusk, 2019; Norstr&#246;m et&#160;al., 2020; Turnhout et&#160;al., 2020). As a&#160;response, regional climate change information is increasingly being developed through participatory and context-specific dialogues that bring together producers and users across disciplines and define climate impacts as one of the many stressors shaping user decisions (Brown and Wilby, 2012; Lemos et&#160;al., 2012). Although there are multiple practical issues involving communication (R&#246;ssler et&#160;al., 2019a), such as providing data in a&#160;format that users can interpret, being mindful of the contextual issues raised in Section&#160;10.5.2 allows non-scientists to be involved in decisions about approaches and assumptions for the distillation and thus to take ownership of the&#160;resultant information&#160;and to make informed decisions based on the distilled information (Pettenger, 2016; Verrax, 2017). Importantly, the application of transdisciplinary engagement processes that emphasize the role of non-scientists in the learning and knowledge production process builds relationships and trust between information users and producers, which is arguably as important for the uptake of climate science into decision-making as the nature of the climate information itself (Section&#160;10.5.2).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="449.93" top="462.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="462.48" x1="449.93" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 462.48; y1: 472.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.3.1 Information Construction</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="438.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="438.6" x1="563.23" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Data, either from observations or models, is in general not inherently information, but may contain relevant information if interpreted appropriately (Hewitson et&#160;al., 2017). The same applies to other sources of climate information. Relevance is controlled by the given user context (Section&#160;10.5.2.1) and relates to the required temporal and spatial scales (Section&#160;10.5.2.3), the characteristics of required variables (often referred to as indicators), and the meteorological and climatic phenomena driving these variables (Section&#160;10.1.3). For example, if climate information for driving impact models is sought (e.g.,&#160;McSweeney et&#160;al., 2015), the impact modelling analysis in the target region is the specific user context.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="294.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="294.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.31; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate risk assessment considers all plausible outcomes (Weaver et&#160;al., 2017; Marchau et&#160;al., 2019; Sutton, 2019).
