<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The <em>climate </em>response pattern in space and/or time to a specific <em>forcing</em> is commonly referred to as a fingerprint. The spatial patterns of sea level response to melting of <em>glaciers</em> or <em>ice sheet</em>s (or other changes in surface loading) are also referred to as fingerprints. Fingerprints are used to detect the presence of this response in observations and are typically estimated using forced <em>climate model</em> simulations.</p></dd>
