<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Prevalence was the primary method used to categorize the demographic makeup of each census tract. For example, if there were more Hispanic people in a census tract than any other population group, it was categorized as a &#8220;Hispanic Prevalent&#8221; tract. There are a total of 27,338 White, 6597 Black, 7917 Hispanic, and 2624 Asian prevalent tracts in the study. Categorization in this way enables comparisons between population groups and the degree of thermal exposure. Furthermore, prevalence is an easy-to-calculate measurement that will capture the group with the highest population within the tract and it is easy to reproduce. However, it does have limitations for categorization. Some categories could contain higher percentages of the secondary population group than are within their primary categorization. For example, a tract that has 51% Hispanic and 49% White populations would be considered a Hispanic prevalent tract. Another tract may have 26% White, 24% Black, 25% Hispanic and 25% Asian populations and would be considered a White prevalent tract. The latter example may not necessarily have a higher population of White persons than the prior categorized tract. These limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.</p>
