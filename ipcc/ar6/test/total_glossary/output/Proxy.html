<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A proxy <em>climate indicator</em> is any biophysical property of materials formed during the past that is interpreted to represent some combination of climate-related variations back in time. Climate-related data derived in this way are referred to as proxy data, and time series of proxy data are proxy records. Examples of proxy types include pollen assemblages, <em>tree ring</em> widths, speleothem and coral geochemistry, and various data derived from marine sediments and glacier ice. Proxy data can be calibrated to provide quantitative climate information.</p></dd>
