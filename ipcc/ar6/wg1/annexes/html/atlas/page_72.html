The main large-scale drivers include the interdecadal modes of natural variability &#8211; the 5 Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific Decadal 6 Oscillation (PDO) &#8211;, the interannual to annual modes of natural variability &#8211; the El Ni&#241;o-Southern 7 Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) &#8211;, the seasonal 8 variability driven by the meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the timing 9 and intensity of the South American Monsoon System, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) subseasonal 10 mode of natural variability, and the behaviour at finer scales of the tropical easterly waves.  11 12 At the subregional scale, several phenomena drive climate variability. In the Amazon (SAM), key drivers 13 include the South-Atlantic Convergence Zone (Marengo et al., 2012), the Bolivian high, the 40- to 60-day 14 intraseasonal oscillation, and the forcing of the high Andes Mountains to the west (Almeida et al., 2017). In 15 the south-western South America (SWS) strip, climate is driven by seasonal changes in the position of 16 subtropical high-pressure air masses in the South Atlantic and South Pacific oceans, the Antarctic 17 Oscillation, the dynamics of the cold Humboldt ocean current, and the icy cold fronts and mid-latitude 18 westerlies (Vald&#233;s-Pineda et al., 2016). In the densely populated, highly productive subregion of south-19 eastern South America (SES), climatic conditions are strongly tied to ENSO, whose influence is moderated 20 by local air-sea thermodynamics in the South Atlantic (Barreiro, 2010). Lastly, the climate of the southern 21 tip of South America (SSA) is influenced by the Southern Annular Mode, and the interaction between the 22 wetter Pacific winds and the Andean Cordillera (Aceituno, 1988; Silvestri and Vera, 2009). 23 24 Given that climates and biomes transcend national political boundaries, new regions have been used for the 25 assessment (see Figure Atlas.2:) that have a consistent climate change response signal and are climatically 26 consistent (Solman et al., 2008; Neukom et al., 2010; Barros et al., 2015; Nobre et al., 2016). Several studies 27 have also used these regions for analysis and impact studies (Fu et al., 2013; Cabr&#233; et al., 2016). 28 29 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 404.93; y1: 415.91; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="404.93" x1="254.97">Previous findings from IPCC assessments </span><span x0="27.66" y0="404.93" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 404.93; y1: 415.91; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">30 31 Some of the main findings of the most recent IPCC assessment reports &#8211; the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 32 for the Working Group I (IPCC, 2013b) and Special Report on 1.5&#176;C Global Warming (IPCC, 2018b) are 33 outlined below.  34 35 AR5 WGI (Flato et al., 2013b) noted that climate simulations from CMIP3 and CMIP5 models were able to 36 well represent the main climatological features, such as seasonal mean and annual cycle (</span><span style="x0: 450.07; x1: 455.55; y0: 316.43; y1: 327.41; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="450.07" y0="316.43" x1="520.04">high confidence</span><span x0="520.03" y0="316.43" x1="41.44" style="x0: 520.03; x1: 523.68; y0: 316.43; y1: 327.41; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">), 37 although some biases remained over the Andes, Amazon basin and for the South America Monsoon.
