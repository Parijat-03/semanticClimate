Integrating the knowledge and skills base of GSW within the core social work professional education and training is vital for cultivating prospective green social workers [<xref rid="B82-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. GSW training assists students in adapting the traditional social work knowledge and interventions from non-disaster scenarios into disaster settings and applies a holist approach to consider multi-factor influences on residents&#8217; health and well-being. The multi-dimensional consequences of extreme events raise the awareness of the importance of the interdisciplinary nature of social work. GSW education builds students&#8217; interdisciplinary capacity so that these potential social workers can work in multidisciplinary professional teams and utilize interdisciplinary interventions to support affected individuals, families, and communities when disaster hits. This multidisciplinary cooperation empowers the social workers&#8217; community-based expertise to promote multi-stakeholder engagement in disaster-driven community development and enhance the individual and collective health and well-being at the individual, family, community, and societal levels. </p>
