Additionally, each domain has impacts on the others through multiple pathways. These interactions are important representations of contextual interdependencies of health determinants, for instance between education and health [<xref rid="B55-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], or between social and economic determinants [<xref rid="B56-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]: individual factors within domains as well as combined effects of two or more domains affect health outcomes.</p>
