<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0155">On August 16th &#8211; still prior to the Federal Court ruling &#8211; I met people in the BC courtroom lobby after a woman was sent to jail for 4 days. Discussions were rife with conversation about the Prime Minister's campaign pledge reversals, environmental justice matters, and the limited space for mounting defences within the courtroom. As one of the court observers explained to me, this judge did not even allow the first group of people arrested (in March) to read short prepared statements to the court. This restriction was eventually modified, after protest, and only after Crown prosecutors &#8211; who regularly sought the highest possible prison sentences &#8211; told the judge they had no problem with such statements being read aloud. People arrested shortly after the introduction of the injunction were given fines, but prison sentences started to increase significantly as time progressed. I spoke with defendants waiting with anxiety for anticipated 14-day prison sentences from &#8216;Judge Pipeline's&#8217; injunction. Yet sentences were eventually increased up to 28 days, with some later defendants sent to jail for months.<xref rid="fn7" ref-type="fn">7</xref>
