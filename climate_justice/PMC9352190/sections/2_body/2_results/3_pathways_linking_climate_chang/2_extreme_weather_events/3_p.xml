<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0009">Extreme weather also can destroy human settlements and forcibly displace communities <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Climate migrants then stay in new locations, which could be temporary shelters or evacuation centers, or other host communities that oftentimes have similarly dire conditions. In these settings, there could be food shortage, lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, and limited employment, which are key proximal determinants of physical and mental health of people including those affected by HIV/AIDs. Physical space is also constrained, while overcrowding and social tensions can create the conditions for risky sexual behavior, which can contribute to increased HIV transmission. Health services in temporary settlements are very basic and limited, while the capacity to deliver care in host communities may be overwhelmed. In both situations, access to HIV prevention and treatment services are very limited, if not lacking at all.</p>
