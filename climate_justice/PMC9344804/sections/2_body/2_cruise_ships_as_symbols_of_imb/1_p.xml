With the appearance of motorized boats like the <italic>vaporetti</italic> in 1910, new problems, such as wash waves, emerged (Petri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1986</xref>: 63). In the following decades, ships navigating the lagoon and the city&#8217;s canals steadily increased in size. The last container ship passed the Piazza San Marco in 2000 (Trevisanato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>: 20). While the political management of the shipping industry has been criticized by local groups for decades, ships transporting goods rather than people did not trigger the same kind of anger. This points to the fact that the cruise ship is more than just a&#160;vehicle used for traversing space. It is also a&#160;symbol that gives scope to different meanings.</p>
