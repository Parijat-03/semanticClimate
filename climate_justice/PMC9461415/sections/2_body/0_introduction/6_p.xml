Based on a Latin American decolonial perspective (Quijano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2000</xref>; Castro-G&#243;mez and Grosfoguel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>), recognizing the coloniality of power that is still being deeply perpetuated by western cultural values, this essay seeks to break through the dominant discourses and to open possibilities for other references, ontologies, and epistemologies beyond the Eurocentric ones. For that, it was inspired by the <italic>Buen Vivir</italic> paradigm (Acosta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>; Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2010</xref>; Gudynas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>), based on the Kichwa term <italic>sumak kawsay</italic> and the Aymara <italic>suma qama&#241;a</italic>, which is one of the alternatives to modern development brought forward by <italic>pluriverse</italic> literature (Escobar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>;&#160;Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>; Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2022</xref>).</p>
