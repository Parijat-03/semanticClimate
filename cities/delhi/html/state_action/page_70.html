Under the LGS, the current picture of energy consumption breakdown is not expected to dramatically change as demand for all end users will grow simultaneously but at a slow economic growth rate. The total energy consumed by all the four sectors in the year 2010 is 156,513,427 (GJ), which is expected to reach 335,695,484 (GJ) in the year 2025 at a CAGR of 7.22 % under the LGS scenario. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.12" top="347.62"><span x0="72.02" y0="347.62" x1="508.12" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 347.62; y1: 359.62; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Under the Low growth scenario the share of transport sector in the total energy consumption in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to be 46.93%, 46.44% &amp; 45.88% respectively as compared to 47% in the year 2010. The total energy consumed by transport sector in the year 2010 is 74,126,305 (GJ), which is expected to reach 154,033,388 (GJ) in the year 2025. The energy demand in the transport sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.00% between the year 2010 and 2025. In the LGS, it is expected that the growth in number of private vehicles will be slow due to a low per capita income resulting in more use of public transport by people. As a consequence, the use of CNG in transport sector is expected to be more as compared to diesel and petrol. Accordingly, the disaggregation of final energy consumption by fuel type in transport sector in the year 2025 is expected to be 35% of diesel, 30% of petrol, 25% of CNG and 10% of electricity. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.32" top="160.99"><span x0="72.02" y0="160.99" x1="508.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 160.99; y1: 172.99; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Under the Low growth scenario the share of domestic sector in the total energy consumption in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to be 35.07%, 35.37% &amp; 35.62% respectively as compared to 35% in the year 2010.
