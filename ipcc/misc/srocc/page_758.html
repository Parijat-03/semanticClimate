The Summary for Policymakers of the Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014b, p. 26) states that &#8216;Indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples&#8217; holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation&#8217; (see also Ford et al. 2016). The IPCC&#8217;s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (SR15) (IPCC 2018a; de Coninck et al. 2018) con&#64257;rms the effectiveness and potential feasibility of adaptation options based on ILK, but also raises concerns that such knowledge systems are being threatened by multiple socio-economic and environmental drivers (</span><span style="x0: 76.34; x1: 80.92; y0: 459.54; y1: 469.04; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="76.34" y0="459.54" x1="133.85">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 133.85; x1: 136.49; y0: 459.54; y1: 469.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="133.85" y0="459.54" x1="551.92">).

SR15 (IPCC 2018a) reserves &#8216;indigenous knowledge&#8217; for culturally distinctive ways of knowing associated with &#8216;societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings&#8217;, while using &#8216;local knowledge&#8217; for &#8216;understandings and skills developed by individuals and populations, speci&#64257;c to the places where they live&#8217;, but not all research studies observe this distinction. This Special Report generally uses ILK as a combined term for these forms of knowledge, but in some sections the terminology used follows that from&#160;the research literature assessed.</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.91" top="327.55"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 76.0; y0: 327.55; y1: 337.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="327.55" x1="551.91">In contrast to scienti&#64257;c knowledge, ILK is context-speci&#64257;c, collective, transmitted informally, and is multi-functional (Mistry and Berardi 2016; Naess 2013; Janif et al. 2016). Persson et al. (2018) characterise ILK as &#8216;practical experience&#8217;, as locally held knowledges are acquired through processes of experience and interaction with the surrounding physical world. ILK is embedded in local institutions (Naess 2013) and in cultural aspects of landscape and food systems (Fuller and Qingwen 2013; Koohafkan and Altieri 2011). ILK can encompass such diverse content as factual information about the environment, guidance on rights and management, value statements about interactions with others, and cosmologies and worldviews that in&#64258;uence how information is&#160;perceived and acted on, among other topics (Spoon 2014; Usher 2000).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.91" top="231.56"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="231.56" x1="551.91">This cross-chapter box assesses evidence for the positive role of ILK in understanding climate change and other environmental processes, and in managing land sustainably in the face of climate change, deserti&#64257;cation, land degradation and food insecurity.

At both global level (Alexander et al. 2011; Green and Raygorodetsky 2010), and local level (Speranza et al. 2010; Ayanlade et al. 2017), strong correlations between local perceptions of climate change and meteorological data have been shown, as calendars, almanacs, and other seasonal and interannual systems knowledge embedded in ILK hold information about environmental baselines (Orlove et al. 2010; Cochran et al. 2016). </span></div></body></html>
