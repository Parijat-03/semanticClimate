<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Today, the majority of the population lives in urban areas and this trend is projected to increase [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Cities with mild Mediterranean climate and close to the sea are particularly attractive, and therefore are characterised by a high population density and growth. These cities also have a high proportion of older people, who are more vulnerable to the health effects of climate change. Cities are also especially vulnerable to climate change due to their architectural and urban design. Many cities with Mediterranean climates are composed of an ancient and compact network of buildings with extremely low energy efficiency, a high proportion of heat-retaining materials and a lack of green spaces; this intensifies the heat island effect and makes it difficult to cope with extreme temperatures [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Urban areas also concentrate the highest number of infrastructures and services that could be affected by extreme climate events, often in cascading fashion [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], impacting a large percentage of the population. In the case of cities with a Mediterranean climate, tourism is an essential economic activity. Millions of tourists circulate each year, contributing to all the complex systems that fuel climate change and hindering mitigation and adaptation policies. During the long hot seasons in summer, both locals and visitors tend to spend long hours in outdoor settings, increasing their exposure to environmental factors [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
