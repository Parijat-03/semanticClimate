These effects are also relatively consistent with recent (post-1980s) declines in rainfall in the Cape Town region. The storyline of an extended drought is thus a&#160;set of events that can yield reduced rainfall in the Cape Town region: a&#160;poleward shift of the downward branch of the Hadley cell that produces a&#160;sustained southward shift in mid-latitude westerlies and storm tracks.

There is a&#160;pressing need to understand if the monsoon will change in the future under anthropogenic forcing and to quantify such changes. Multiple datasets have shown robust negative trends since the 1950s until the turn of the century (Bollasina et&#160;al., 2011) followed by a&#160;recovery (Jin and Wang, 2017), yet repeated assessments project the monsoon to increase in strength under enhanced GHG forcing (Christensen et&#160;al., 2007, 2013; Sections 8.3.2.4.1 and 8.4.2.4.1). The apparent contradiction between future projections and observed historical trends makes the region an ideal choice for an in-depth assessment.

The south-westerly monsoon winds are incident upon the Western Ghats mountains on the west coast, leading to orographic enhancement and heavy rains (Shige et&#160;al., 2017), which supply rivers with water for much of the southern peninsula, often the subject of inter-regional water disputes. The northern plains contain the&#160;Ganges river and also India&#8217;s most intensive agriculture, both rainfed and irrigated. Synoptic systems known as monsoon depressions cross the northern east coast, supplying much of the rain in central India (Hunt and Fletcher, 2019). Further north, the eastern Himalayas&#160;are dominated by the summer monsoon, while the western Himalayas receive most rainfall from western disturbances during winter (Palazzi et&#160;al., 2013). Meanwhile, south-eastern India sits under a&#160;rain shadow (the only region to receive more rainfall during the winter monsoon).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="466.75" top="330.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="330.48" x1="466.75" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 330.48; y1: 340.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.3.3 Observational Issues for India</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.22" top="306.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="306.6" x1="563.22" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">India has one of the oldest rain-gauge networks in the world, leading to the production of numerous observational products (reviewed in Khouider et&#160;al., 2020). Gridded gauge-based products dating back to the 19th&#160;century reveal pronounced decadal variability (Sontakke et&#160;al., 2008). Trends for India over the whole 20th&#160;century are inconclusive (Knutson and Zeng, 2018), although declining over central and northern areas (Roxy et&#160;al., 2015). Assessment of multiple observational datasets covering the Indian summer monsoon reveals significant declining rainfall over the second half of the 20th&#160;century (Section&#160;8.3.2.4.1 and Figure&#160;10.19c,d).

A&#160;newer 0.25&#176;-gridded product covering 1901 onwards (Pai et&#160;al., 2014, 2015), based on Shepard&#8217;s interpolation method for irregularly-spaced stations (Shepard, 1968), shows increased intensity of daily rainfall and extremes over some regions, especially in the late-20th&#160;century.
