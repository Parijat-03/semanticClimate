The epistemic ambiguity in adaptation, in absence of a politically agreed definition, compounds the problem. Increasingly, the positive externalities of adaptation actions as &#8220;multi-level public goods,&#8221; at domestic, transboundary, and global levels, are being articulated (Banda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>; Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). Kaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017a</xref>) cogently argues that climate finance suffers from theoretical and institutional lock-in, with reliance on theories and practices that fit neither the GPG nature of climate change nor the current policymaking realities. We may recall that public goods were defined as non-excludable and non-rival in consumption almost 70 years back by Samuelson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1954</xref>), when extraterritorial pollution problems were not yet a global agenda. As adaptation is a new but contested public policy arena, our articulation is based on constructivism, that public goods as a living category are variable social constructs, in response to evolving national and global needs, as matters of policy choice.</p>
