The emissions mitigation pathways compatible with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C goal entail drastic reductions, reductions that should be at least 7.6% per year in the 2020&#8211;2030 period. Nevertheless, GHG emissions continue to increase, and at a global level, the commitments for 2030 that are stated by countries in their current NDCs lead humanity away from the goal (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>; H&#246;hne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>).</p>
