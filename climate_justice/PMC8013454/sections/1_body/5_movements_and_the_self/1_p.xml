He describes young demonstrators as less entrenched in fixed social structures than older generations, which is why they can more easily question them. For him, this raises the question whether climate protest is just a phase in the life of a young person or whether we are witnessing a more lasting change in discourse. Arne Harms invites us to consider so&#8208;called regenerative cultures as an invisible yet intimate form of activism. As a practice that requires turning inwards and practising self&#8208;care, regenerative culture is about forming a resilient self in the face of political inaction and needs to be understood in the wider context of environmental decline. In her text, Paula Serafini argues that a joint global movement based on a decolonial, ecofeminist ethic of care is required to fight the multiple interconnected challenges of our times.</p>
