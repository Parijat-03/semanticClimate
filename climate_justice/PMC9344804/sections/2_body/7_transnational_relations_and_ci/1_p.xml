Global developments and digital tools shape not only the content of protests but also their actor constellations, organizational forms, and effects (Daphi &amp; Deitelhoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>: 306). Social media allows activists to provide each other with moral support while visualization tools allow the committee to portray the ship as an intruder that threatens both activists and residents alike. Aside from their local usages, the committee&#8217;s framings have also been shared by other groups.</p>
