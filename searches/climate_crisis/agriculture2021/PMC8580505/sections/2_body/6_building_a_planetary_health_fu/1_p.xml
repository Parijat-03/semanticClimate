Doing so involves addressing the anthropogenic factors known to increase the risk of spillover events&#8212;land-use change, wildlife trade, intensive livestock production, and climate change&#8212;and, crucially, addressing COVID-19's effects on biodiversity loss and ecosystem health, which in turn, can exacerbate these drivers.</p>
