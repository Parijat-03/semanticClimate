<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The paper uses quite a bit of jargon and doesn't define a lot of important terms in terms of their analysis (e.g. vulnerability, index, community). Index is used to refer to both heat indices (which combine meteorological variables) and PCA-based weighting schemes to make an abstract assessment of risk. They include glossary definition in text, but need to better define important terms in a way that is relevant to the paper.</p>
