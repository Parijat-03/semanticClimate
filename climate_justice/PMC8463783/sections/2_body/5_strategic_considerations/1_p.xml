<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" content-type="flushleft">First, evidence is rapidly growing that a wide range of land management practices that conserve, restore, or sustainably manage natural ecosystems and working lands, collectively termed Natural Climate Solutions (NCS), constitute a vital toolbox for practical biosphere stewardship that could deliver a third of global CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions needed by 2030 (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Turning again to the MAGICC6 model, we estimate that full implementation of NCS, in conjunction with the broader Paris-compatible decarbonization across all sectors embedded in RCP2.6, would limit warming by an additional 0.3 &#176;C by the end of the century (green line in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). To deliver on the full potential of NCS, however, a roadmap is needed that specifies the stewardship actions&#8212;connecting key actors to strategies and places&#8212;to catalyze an exponential decline in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through 2050 (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The roadmap&#8217;s long-term goals are already clear: 1) rapidly safeguard irrecoverable carbon stocks in vulnerable terrestrial and coastal ecosystems [i.e., stocks that, if lost, cannot be recovered by 2050 (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)]; 2) achieve a net carbon absorbing land use sector; and 3) restore and regenerate degraded native ecosystems as carbon sinks. The latter goal requires resilience-building strategies, including disturbance management, in contrast to restoring carbon sinks through single species and simplified ecosystem that are vulnerable to climate shocks like fires or droughts.</p>
