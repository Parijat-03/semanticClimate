which about a third are based in Latin America), which struggle collectively for
greater social justice, gender equality and environmental sustainability. For over
45 years, the Coalition has brought together social movements, non-governmental
organizations, community-based organizations and activist and research institutions
with a common political purpose: mobilizing their collective muscle from local to
global scales to make visible, defend and produce habitat rights.<sup>(<xref rid="fn2-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">2</xref>)</sup> In keeping with
its collective orientation, the Coalition&#8217;s structures (its Board, General
Secretariat and Regional Coordination Offices) follow the mandate of HIC&#8217;s Members,
who are their governing body.</p>
