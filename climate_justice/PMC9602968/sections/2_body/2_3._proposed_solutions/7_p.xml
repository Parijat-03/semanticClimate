For instance, traditional epidemiologic approaches that leverage healthcare utilization or mortality data are hindered by lack of access to data or insufficient available data [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], resulting from lack of healthcare infrastructure in situ and low population density [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Alternative approaches, including qualitative methods, may provide more context-specific information about health impacts, and must be coupled with vigorous attempts to advance rural access to public health data and analytical resources.</p>
