Twitter was identified as an abundant source of geolocated statements from members of the public, and using the Twitter Developer Academic Research product track, we downloaded 66,393 tweets via the Twitter API.<fn id="j_jwl-2022-0017_fn_009"><label>9</label><p>Using the &#8216;searchtweets-v2&#8217; Python package, available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/searchtweets-v2/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pypi.org/project/searchtweets-v2/</ext-link>.</p></fn> The criteria for tweets to be downloaded were: (i)&#160;they must contain one or more of the relevant terms (see <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_app_001" ref-type="app">Appendix B</xref>); (ii) they must be in English and be geotagged to the UK, to try and capture British English language patterns; (iii) they must fall within the timeframe January 2016 to January 2021; and (iv) they must not be a retweet, so as to keep the level of corpus noise to a minimum.</p>
