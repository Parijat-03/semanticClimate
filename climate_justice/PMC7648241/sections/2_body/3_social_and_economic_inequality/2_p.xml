The coronavirus pandemic turned into a serious economic crisis because the political economy <italic>before</italic> the pandemic (e.g. a decade-long austerity, a growth in insecure job employment) allowed the virus to deprive economically precarious people of their livelihoods (McKee and Stuckler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). One of the most striking paradoxes of the COVID-19 response is that those who work at low-skilled jobs were suddenly seen as &#8220;essential workers&#8221; during the lockdown. While these &#8220;essential workers&#8221; needed to keep going out to maintain the functioning of social systems, the wealthier individuals who are usually most mobile in normal times became least mobile during the lockdown because they could afford to self-quarantine at home (Weill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>; see also Bonaccorsi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Put simply, social distancing is the privilege of the rich while the poor suffer from it.</p>
