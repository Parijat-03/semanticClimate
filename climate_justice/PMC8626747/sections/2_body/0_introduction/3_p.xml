While analysing the cases of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (hereafter, only China) and the European Union (EU), and their claimed leading roles in the climate multilateral regime, we point out several contradictions that dialectically result from their policy goals guided by strategic interests. Inspired by a Neo-Gramscian perspective (Cox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1987</xref>; Ollman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>; Teschke and Cemgil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>), we hypothesize that the promotion of a global zero/low carbon economy agenda raises a new rationale for political behaviour and the need to (re)define the rules of the international climate game. Nonetheless, this redefinition involves a set of constraints related both to short-term economic interests in different world regions and the realities of political power analyzed from the global justice frame of reference (Baer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Bourban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>; Holifield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>; Lucke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021</xref>).</p>
