He described such gatherings as connected to broader critiques of big and unnecessary infrastructure projects, whether in places like Stuttgart or in Italian cities. Through common causes, such as the No High Speed Trains (<italic>No Tav</italic>) movement&#8217;s fight against highspeed railways in the Susa Valley in Piedmont, they got to know the committee.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21">21</xref> The <italic>Stuttgart&#160;21</italic> protests touch on &#8220;the question of power in representative democracies, the use of economic resources and, more generally, the question of the right life&#8221; (Sch&#246;nberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>: 28). <italic>AmbienteVenezia</italic> comments in a&#160;similarly critical way on the possibility of a&#160;future-oriented coexistence. &#8220;This is the city and the territory we want&#8221; (&#8220;<italic>Ecco la citta&#8217; e il territorio che vogliamo</italic>&#8221;) reads their newsletter, which they use to describe risks and provide alternatives to current government plans. All of these movements share the conviction that the political &#8220;no longer constitutes a&#160;claim to power, to hegemony&#8221; (Sch&#246;nberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>: 28), proposing instead a&#160;collaborative approach to knowledge production and governance.</p>
