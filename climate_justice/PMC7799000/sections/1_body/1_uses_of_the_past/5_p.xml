We're also dealing with people destroying their entire collections of human remains and their specimens because they're afraid of backlash about where they came from. I think that it's important to have that conversation about our responsibility for preservation while also acknowledging where many of these specimens came from and their potential to further medical knowledge and treatments, not just in the future but in the near future.</p>
