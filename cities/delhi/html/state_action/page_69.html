The disaggregation of final energy consumption by fuel type in transport sector in the year 2025 is expected to be 40% of diesel, 30% of petrol, 20% of CNG and 10% of electricity. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.28" top="680.91"><span x0="72.02" y0="680.91" x1="508.28" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 680.91; y1: 692.91; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Under the BAU scenario the share of domestic sector in the total energy consumption in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to be 35.06%, 35.36% &amp; 35.61% respectively as compared to 35% in the year 2010. The total energy consumed by domestic sector in the year 2010 is 54,360,127 (GJ), which is expected to reach 158,546,413 (GJ) in the year 2025. The energy demand in the domestic sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.40% between the year 2010 and 2025. The rise in domestic energy demand will result from increase in number of households, floor area per capita &amp; appliance ownership. Whereas the consumption of electricity will continue to increase, the consumption of LPG will marginally fall and that of Piped natural gas (PNG) will increase, resulting in a fuel switch in cooking gas over the period of next 15 years. According to our assumptions the share of PNG in total energy consumption of domestic sector in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to increase to 5%, 10% and 20% respectively. We also assume that by 2025 there will be no use of kerosene in domestic sector for lighting purpose. The disaggregation of final energy consumption by fuel type in domestic sector in the year 2025 is expected to be 60% of electricity, 20% of LPG and 20% of PNG. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.31" top="430.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="430.78" x1="508.31" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 430.78; y1: 442.78; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The share of commercial sector in the total energy consumption under the BAU scenario in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to be 11.32%, 11.79% &amp; 12.33% respectively as compared to 10.90% in the year 2010. The total energy consumed by commercial sector in the year 2010 is 17,067,600 (GJ), which is expected to reach 54,879,146 (GJ) in the year 2025. The energy demand in the commercial sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.10% between the year 2010 and 2025. The increase in per capita income &amp; standard of living of people has resulted into a change in lifestyle &amp; culture of Indians. This trend is likely to continue in future, with the increase in purchasing power of people the demand for commercial activities is expected to grow resulting in a rise in the share of energy consumption from commercial sector. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.06" top="260.11"><span x0="72.02" y0="260.11" x1="508.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 260.11; y1: 272.11; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Similarly, the share of industrial sector in the total energy consumption under the BAU scenario in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected to be 6.69%, 6.40% &amp; 6.15% respectively as compared to 7.0% in the year 2010. The total energy consumed by industrial sector in the year 2010 is 10,959,395 (GJ), which is expected to reach 27,392,387 (GJ) in the year 2025. The energy demand in the industrial sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.30% between the year 2010 and 2025. Though the aggregate industrial energy demand is expected to increase over the period of next 15 years, the pace of growth of industrial sector is declining. The main reasons behind this fall of growth rate are less number of industrial activities in Delhi, majority of the industries is light industries and an expected increase in the share of service sector in Delhi&#8217;s economy over the period of next 15 years. The disaggregation of final energy consumption by fuel type in industrial sector in the year 2025 is expected to be 90% of electricity and 10% of industrial oils.
