[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] did not directly address the fairness or appropriateness of the allocation principles they identified in the SBT methods but argued that the principles should be clearly communicated to companies and their stakeholders to facilitate understanding of the value judgment involved and informed method choices. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] went further in arguing that the SDA method&#8217;s lack of attention to &#8220;common but differentiated responsibilities&#8221; between nations means that resulting SBTs are inconsistent with national commitments to the Paris Agreement, which tend to involve higher emission reductions for high-income countries than low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, Aden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] questioned how SBTs can &#8220;best address the equity and distributional challenges of common but differentiated responsibilities?&#8221; Finally, taking a fundamentally critical stance towards the very idea of allocating global allowable emission to companies, Trexler and Schendler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] characterized the attempt to &#8220;draw an explicit link between individual corporate targets and achievement of a global emissions reduction goal&#8221; as &#8220;voodoo economics.&#8221;</p>
