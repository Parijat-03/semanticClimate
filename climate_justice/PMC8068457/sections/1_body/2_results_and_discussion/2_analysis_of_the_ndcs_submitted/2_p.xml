<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par44">Countries that by 2030 will have consumed less than 40% of their national emissions budget as allocated by the MCJ for the period 2018&#8211;2100. Among these are Syria, Morocco, and Egypt, all classified as low-income or lower-middle-income countries, and Albania which, despite belonging to the upper middle income country group, occupies the 16th place in the GDP per capita within the group of the 21 Mediterranean countries. These countries would receive, as of 2030, more than 60% of the budget assigned by the MCJ. This means that, within the framework of climate justice in which the MCJ operates, their NDCs can be considered ambitious. The contributions from these countries are in line with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Countries that by 2030 will have consumed between 40 and 100% of their allocated national emissions budget for the period 2018&#8211;2100. Among these are:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par46">Four countries, Croatia, France, Cyprus, and Malta, are from the EU27 and therefore high-income countries. These countries should increase their ambition. Taking into account that, in December 2020, the EU27 updated its NDC and increased its ambition, it is expected that, when it reviews the internal emissions distribution among the EU27 countries, they will align firmly with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">In this group, there are also three non-Annex I countries: Algeria, Lebanon, and Tunisia. In their NDCs, these three countries present conditional targets that could be achieved if they receive foreign aid. Taking into account the existing cooperation frameworks between Mediterranean countries, it would be advisable to launch as soon as possible some mechanisms that will allow these countries to achieve their conditional commitments and in this way put them on the correct path to achieve the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global goal.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3.</label><p id="Par48">Nine countries that, by 2030, will have released emissions above the budget allocated by the MCJ until the end of the century. Among these there are different groups:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par49">Four EU27 countries: Greece, Italy, Spain, and Slovenia. As mentioned before, it is expected that they will increase their ambition level within the framework of the updated EU27 NDC so as to bring them in line with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">Two European countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, which are coal producers with an electricity sector that is highly dependent on this fuel. Both countries have energy intensities, carbon intensities, and emission intensities above the Mediterranean regional average. The NDC of Bosnia and Herzegovina sets two mitigation targets, one unconditional and another conditional. The former indicates an 18% emission increase with respect to the base year, 1990, and the latter shows a 3% reduction. Montenegro only presents an unconditional target with a reduction of 30% with respect to 1990; however, it can allow for a much more ambitious target since, if it follows a trend scenario, it will already have reduced its emissions by nearly 50%.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Israel, a high-income country with a commitment that, according to the MCJ framework, is unambitious. It is particularly concerning that the emissions of this country have not yet started to decrease and that the country has not yet expressed any intention to review the NDC submitted in 2016 (Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Turkey, an upper-middle-income country that belongs to Annex I of the UNFCCC, despite the fact that it has repeatedly shown its desire to abandon this categorization (Republic of Turkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). Turkey is currently among the top 15 emitters, and its emissions are increasing. As mentioned before, the MCJ allocates a future emissions budget to Turkey that is similar to the one used for the 1994&#8211;2017 period. This budget, if managed properly, would allow it to make a smooth transition to a low emission development pathway. The fact that its INDC, by 2030, already uses more than its entire budget, and also that its emissions are increasing, means that this country is far offtrack from the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Libya deserves a separate comment. The armed conflict that has affected the country for many years explains why, to date, no national communication nor Biennale Update Report has been submitted to the UNFCCC, so there is no evidence that this country intends to carry out mitigation policies. If this situation continues, this country, which is a large oil and natural gas exporter, will have consumed, by 2030, 2.6 times the emissions budget allocated by the MCJ.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Percentage of cumulative emissions that, according to the current NDCs, will have been released into the atmosphere in 2030 (bars beige + red) with respect to the emissions allocated by the MCJ for the 2018&#8211;2100 period. The beige bar indicates the percentage that falls within the allocated, and the red one, the&#160;emissions that exceed the allocation. The blue bar indicates the percentage that would be available for countries from 2030 onwards.
