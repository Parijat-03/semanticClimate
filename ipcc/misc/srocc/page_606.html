The most sprawling cities in the US have experienced extreme heat waves, more than double those of denser cities, and &#8216;urban albedo and vegetation enhancement strategies have signi&#64257;cant potential to reduce heat-related health impacts&#8217; (Stone et&#160;al. 2010). Other adaption co-bene&#64257;ts are less well understood. There are likely to be cost savings from managing planning growth (one study found 2% savings in metropolitan budgets, which can then be spent on adaptation planning) (Deal and Schunk 2004).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="399.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 399.54; y1: 409.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="399.54" x1="307.58">Diversi&#64257;cation is a major adaptation strategy and form of risk management, as it can help households smooth out income &#64258;uctuations and provide a broader range of options for the future (Osbahr et&#160;al. 2008; Adger et&#160;al. 2011; Thornton and Herrero 2014). Surveys of farmers in climate variable areas &#64257;nd that livelihood diversi&#64257;cation is increasingly favoured as an adaptation option (Bryan et&#160;al. 2013), although it is not always successful, since it can increase exposure to climate variability (Adger et&#160;al. 2011). There are more than 570 million small farms in the world (Lowder et&#160;al. 2016), and many millions of smallholder agriculturalists already practice livelihood diversi&#64257;cation by engaging in multiple forms of off-farm income (Rigg 2006). It is not clear, however, how many farmers have not yet practiced diversi&#64257;cation and thus how many would be helped by supporting this response option. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.53" top="231.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="231.56" x1="307.53">Currently, millions of farmers still rely to some degree on local seeds. Use of local seeds can facilitate adaptation for many smallholders, as moving to use of commercial seeds can increase costs for farmers (Howard 2015). Seed networks and banks protect local agrobiodiversity and landraces, which are important to facilitate adaptation, as local landraces may be resilient to some forms of climate change (Coomes et&#160;al. 2015; Van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017; Vasconcelos et&#160;al. 2013).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="627.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 627.57; y1: 637.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="627.57" x1="566.12">Disaster risk management is an essential part of adaptation strategies. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has operated across three continents since the 1980s, and many millions of people across 34 countries have access to early information on drought. Such information can assist communities and households in adapting to onset conditions (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012). However, concerns have been raised as to how many people are actually reached by disaster risk management and early warning systems; for example, less than 50% of respondents in Bangladesh had heard a cyclone warning before it hit, even though an early warning system existed (Mahmud and Prowse 2012). Further, there are concerns that current early warning systems &#8216;tend to focus on response and recovery rather than on addressing livelihood issues as part of the process of reducing underlying risk factors,&#8217; (Birkmann et&#160;al. 2015), leading to less adaptation potential being realised.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="423.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 321.92; y0: 423.59; y1: 433.09; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="423.59" x1="566.09">Local risk-sharing instruments like rotating credit or loan groups can help buffer farmers against climate impacts and help facilitate adaptation. Both index and commercial crop insurance offers some potential for adaptation, as it provides a means of buffering and transferring weather risk, saving farmers the cost of crop losses (Meze-Hausken et&#160;al. 2009; Patt et&#160;al. 2010). However, overly subsidised insurance can undermine the market&#8217;s role in pricing risks and thus depress more rapid adaptation strategies (Skees and Collier 2012; Jaworski 2016) and increase the riskiness of decision-making (McLeman and Smit 2006). For example, availability of crop insurance was observed to reduce farm-level diversi&#64257;cation in the US, a factor cited as increasing adaptive capacity (Sanderson et&#160;al. 2013) and crop insurance-holding soybean farmers in the USA have been less likely to adapt to extreme weather events than those not holding insurance (Annan and Schlenker 2015). It is unclear how many people worldwide use insurance as an adaptation strategy; Platteau et&#160;al. (2017) suggest that less than 30% of smallholders take out any form of insurance, but it is likely in the millions.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="195.62"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 195.62; y1: 205.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="195.62" x1="566.12">Table 6.28 summarises the impacts on adaptation of risk management options, with con&#64257;dence estimates based on the thresholds outlined in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not exhaustive) references upon which the evidence in based.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="326.99" top="141.33"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.38; y0: 141.33; y1: 149.33; width: 3.85; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="141.33" x1="326.99">Table 6.28 |   Adaptation effects of response options based on risk management.</span></div><div left="63.62" right="442.51" top="124.4"><span style="x0: 63.62; x1: 65.85; y0: 124.4; y1: 132.4; width: 2.22; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="63.62" y0="124.4" x1="442.51">Integrated response optionPotentialCon&#64257;denceCitation</span></div><div left="65.32" right="462.04" top="111.42"><span style="x0: 65.32; x1: 70.77; y0: 111.42; y1: 118.42; width: 5.45; font-size: 7.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.32" y0="111.42" x1="462.04">Management of urban sprawlUnquanti&#64257;ed but likely to be many millionsLow con&#64257;denceStone et&#160;al. 2010</span></div><div left="65.32" right="482.49" top="98.23"><span style="x0: 65.32; x1: 68.17; y0: 98.23; y1: 105.23; width: 2.85; font-size: 7.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.32" y0="98.23" x1="482.49">Livelihood diversi&#64257;cation&gt;100 million likelyLow con&#64257;denceMorton 2007; Rigg 2006</span></div><div left="65.32" right="494.27" top="85.04"><span style="x0: 65.32; x1: 69.47; y0: 85.04; y1: 92.04; width: 4.14; font-size: 7.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.32" y0="85.04" x1="494.27">Use of local seedsUnquanti&#64257;ed but likely to be many millionsLow con&#64257;denceLouwaars 2002; Santilli 2012</span></div><div left="65.32" right="495.1" top="71.85"><span style="x0: 65.32; x1: 69.34; y0: 71.85; y1: 78.85; width: 4.02; font-size: 7.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.32" y0="71.85" x1="495.1">Disaster risk management&gt;100 million High con&#64257;denceHillbruner and Moloney 2012</span></div></body></html>
