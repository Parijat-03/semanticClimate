In the case of adaptation to climate change (and particularly regarding limits to adaptation), a&#160;crucial ambiguity of resilience is the question of whether resilience is a&#160;normative concept (i.e., resilience is good or bad) or a&#160;descriptive characteristic of a&#160;system (i.e., neither good nor bad). Previous IPCC reports have de&#64257;ned resilience as a&#160;normative (positive) attribute (see AR5 Glossary), while the wider scienti&#64257;c literature is divided on this (Weichselgartner and Kelman 2015; Strunz 2012; Brown 2014; Grimm and Calabrese 2011; Thor&#233;n and Olsson 2018). For example, is outmigration from a&#160;disaster-prone area considered a&#160;successful adaptation (high resilience) or a&#160;collapse of the livelihood system (lack of resilience) (Thor&#233;n and Olsson 2018)? In this report, resilience is considered a&#160;positive attribute when it maintains capacity for adaptation, learning and/or transformation.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.96" top="543.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 68.96; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="543.55" x1="312.96">Furthermore, &#8216;resilience&#8217; and the related terms &#8216;adaptation&#8217; and &#8216;transformation&#8217; are de&#64257;ned and used differently by different communities (Quinlan et al. 2016). The relationship and hierarchy of resilience with respect to vulnerability and adaptive capacity are also debated, with different perspectives between disaster management and global change communities, (e.g.,&#160;Cutter et al. 2008). Nevertheless, these differences in usage need not inhibit the application of &#8216;resilience thinking&#8217; in managing land degradation; researchers using these terms, despite variation in de&#64257;nitions, apply the same fundamental concepts to inform management of human-environment systems, to maintain or improve the resource base, and sustain livelihoods. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.37; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="387.56" x1="312.98">Applying resilience concepts involves viewing the land as a&#160;component of an interlinked social-ecological system; identifying key relationships that determine system function and vulnerabilities of the system; identifying thresholds or tipping points beyond which the system transitions to an undesirable state; and devising management strategies to steer away from thresholds of potential concern, thus facilitating healthy systems and sustainable production (Walker et al. 2009). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="279.58"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.37; y0: 279.58; y1: 289.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="279.58" x1="312.98">A threshold is a&#160;non-linearity between a&#160;controlling variable and system function, such that a&#160;small change in the variable causes the system to shift to an alternative state. Bestelmeyer et al. (2015) and Prince et al. (2018) illustrate this concept in the context of land degradation. Studies have identi&#64257;ed various biophysical and socio-economic thresholds in different land-use systems. For example, 50% ground cover (living and dead plant material and biological crusts) is a&#160;recognised threshold for dryland grazing systems (e.g.,&#160;Tighe et al. 2012); below this threshold, the in&#64257;ltration rate declines, risk of erosion causing loss of topsoil increases,a&#160;switch from perennial to annual grass species occurs and there is a&#160;consequential sharp decline in productivity. This shift to a&#160;lower-productivity state cannot be reversed without signi&#64257;cant human intervention. Similarly, the combined pressure of water limitations and frequent &#64257;re can lead to transition from closed forest to savannah or grassland: if &#64257;re is too frequent, trees do not reach reproductive maturity and post-&#64257;re regeneration will fail; likewise, reduced rainfall/increased drought prevents successful forest regeneration (Reyer et al. 2015; Thompson et al. 2009) (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;3&#160;in Chapter&#160;2).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.52" top="735.55"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 325.74; y0: 735.55; y1: 745.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.55" x1="571.52">In managing land degradation, it is important to assess the resilience of the existing system, and the proposed management interventions. If the existing system is in an undesirable state or considered unviable under expected climate trends, it may be desirable to promote adaptation or even transformation to a&#160;different system that is more resilient to future changes. For example, in an irrigation district where water shortages are predicted, measures could be implemented to improve water use ef&#64257;ciency, for example, by establishing drip irrigation systems for water delivery, although transformation to pastoralism or mixed dryland cropping/livestock production may be more sustainable in the longer term, at least for part of the area. Application of SLM practices, especially those focused on ecological functions (e.g.,&#160;agroecology, ecosystem-based approaches, regenerative agriculture, organic farming), can be effective in building resilience of agro-ecosystems (Henry et al. 2018). Similarly, the resilience of managed forests can be enhanced by SFM that protects or enhances biodiversity, including assisted migration of tree species within their current range limit (Winder et al. 2011; Pedlar et al. 2012) or increasing species diversity in plantation forests (Felton et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2018a). The essential features of a&#160;resilience approach to management of land degradation under climate change are described by&#160;O&#8217;Connell et al. (2016) and Simonsen et al.

This approach will increase the likelihood that SLM/SFM and land restoration/rehabilitation interventions achieve long-term environmental and social bene&#64257;ts.

An ecosystem approach to sustainable land management (SLM) based on an understanding of land degradation processes has been recommended to separate multiple drivers, pressures and impacts (Kassam et al. 2013), but large uncertainty in model projections of future climate, and associated ecosystem processes (IPCC 2013a) pose additional challenges to the implementation of SLM. As discussed earlier in this chapter, many SLM practices, including technologies and approaches, are available that can increase yields and contribute to closing the yield gap between actual and potential crop or pasture yield, while also enhancing resilience to climate change (Yengoh and Ard&#246; 2014; WOCAT&#160;n.d.). However, there are often systemic barriers to adoption and scaling up of SLM practices, especially in developing countries. </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.45" top="87.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 329.06; y0: 87.54; y1: 97.04; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="87.54" x1="571.45">Uitto (2016) identi&#64257;ed areas that the GEF, the &#64257;nancial mechanism of the UNCCD, UNFCCC and other multilateral environmental agreements, can address to solve global environmental problems.
