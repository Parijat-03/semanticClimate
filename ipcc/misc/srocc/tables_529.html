      <td>Climate change-induced displacement and migration in the Pacific has received wide attention in the scientific discourse (Fr&#246;hlich and\nKlepp 2019). The processes of climate change and their effects in the region have serious implications for Pacific Island nations as\nthey influence the environments that are their &#8216;life-support systems&#8217; (Campbell 2014). Climate variability poses significant threats to\nboth agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures and reductions in groundwater availability, as well as increasing\nfrequency and severity of disaster events translate into substantial impacts on food security, causing human displacement, a trend\nthat will be aggravated by future climate impacts (ADB 2017). Declining soil productivity, groundwater depletion, and non-availability\nof freshwater threatens agricultural production in many remote atolls.</td>

      <td>Many countries in the Pacific devote a large share of available land area to agricultural production. For example, more than 60% of land\narea is cultivated in the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu and more than 40% in Kiribati and Tonga. With few options to expand agricultural\narea, the projected impacts of climate change on food production are of particular concern (ADB 2013, 2017). The degradation of\navailable land area for traditional agriculture, adverse disruptions of agricultural productivity and diminishing livelihood opportunities\nthrough climate change impacts leads to increasing poverty and food insecurity, incentivising migration to urban agglomerations\n(ADB 2017; FAO et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>Campbell (2014) describe the trends that lead to migration. First, climate change, including rising sea levels, affects communities&#8217; land\nsecurity, which is the physical presence on which to live and sustain livelihoods. Second, they impinge on livelihood security (especially\nfood security) of island communities where the productivity of both subsistence and commercial food production systems is reduced.\nThird, the effects of climate change are especially severe on small-island environments since they result in declining ecological habitat.\nThe effects on island systems are mostly manifested in atolls through erosion and inundation, and on human populations through\nmigration. Population growth and scenarios of climate change are likely to further induce food stress as impacts unfold in the coming\ndecades (Campbell 2015).</td>

      <td>While the populations of several islands and island groups in the Pacific (e.g., Tuvalu, Carteret Islands, and Kiribati) have been\nperceived as the first probable victims of rising seas so that their inhabitants would become, and in some quarters already are seen\nto be, the first &#8216;environmental&#8217; or &#8216;climate change refugees&#8217;, migration patterns vary. Especially in small islands, the range and nature\nof the interactions among economic, social, and/or political drivers are complex. For example, in the Maldives, Stojanov et al. (2017)\nshow that while collective perceptions support climate change impacts as being one of the key factors prompting migration, individual\nperceptions give more credence to other cultural, religious, economic or social factors.</td>

      <td>In the Pacific, Tuvalu has long been a prime candidate to disappear due to rising sea levels, forcing human migration. However, results\nof a recent study (Kench et al. 2018) challenge perceptions of island loss in Tuvalu, reporting that there is a net increase in land area\nof 73.5 ha. The findings suggest that islands are dynamic features likely to persist as habitation sites over the next century, presenting\nopportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and processes. Farbotko (2010) and Farbotko and Lazrus\n(2012) present Tuvalu as a site of &#8216;wishful sinking&#8217;, in the climate change discourse. These authors argue that representations of Tuvalu\nas a laboratory for global climate change migration are visualisations by non-locals.</td>

      <td>In Nanumea (Tuvalu), forced displacements and voluntary migrations are complex decisions made by individuals, families and communities\nin response to discourses on risk, deteriorating infrastructure and other economic and social pressures (Marino and Lazrus 2015).\nIn many atoll nations in the Western Pacific, migration has increasingly become a sustainable livelihood strategy, irrespective of\nclimate change (Connell 2015).</td>

      <td>In Lamen Bay, Vanuatu, migration is both a cause and consequence of local vulnerabilities. While migration provides an opportunity for\nhouseholds to meet their immediate economic needs, it limits the ability of the community to foster longer-term economic development.\nAt the same time, migration adversely affects the ability of the community to maintain food security due to lost labour and changing\nattitudes towards traditional ways of life among community members (Craven 2015).</td>
