Such an Extension practice eschews neutrality, embraces a liberatory ethos, and sees itself as actively participating in, rather than simply&#160;responding to, processes of social change in solidarity with the poor and vulnerable. In order meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the current moment, we should work to amplify these liberatory tendencies in Extension, with a conscious reorientation of institutional resources and attention towards the construction of economic, food, and socio-natural systems rooted in principles of fairness and ecological balance, and, simultaneously, to strengthen movements for far reaching transition policies. Liberation Extension allies with movements to construct alternatives that address structural contradictions in social and economic systems and invites working people to participate collectively in these processes. There is an ongoing conversation in Extension about how to build on existing work, to do it better, more systematically and effectively. In their recent volume about Extension professionals, for example, Peters et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>) encourage us to &#8220;open our collective imagination to possibilities for professionals to jump into civic life in ways that support the task of making democracy work&#8221; (16).</p>
