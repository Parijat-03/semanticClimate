We can avoid the worst outcomes of current trends and build a more just society in the process. In fact, addressing historical injustices goes hand in hand with responding meaningfully to the ecological and economic crisis. But we must act decisively and collectively to adopt distinct paradigms of thought and build new structures to sustain new ways of living and relating. However, the organizational and imaginary capacities to build this future do not yet exist and will not simply materialize out of necessity. We must creatively weave democratic impulses into organization and concrete processes of change. This multigenerational task faces powerful opposition, in the form of denialism, disinformation, outright repression, as well as a wave of shallow solutions designed to channel the desire for change back into unsustainable systems. Extension can play a humble but significant role in building the conceptual and organizational capacities for a just civilizational transition.</p>
