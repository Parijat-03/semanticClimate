<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To obtain a more informative proxy measure of pro-environmental behavior, participants calculated their current individual carbon footprint with a carbon footprint calculator developed by the German Environment Agency (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Umweltbundesamt [UBA], 2022</xref>). The calculator was embedded into the survey so that there was no need to leave the website. The questions covered the domains (1) living and electricity, (2) mobility, (3) diet, (4) other consumer behavior, and (5) public emissions. The participants had to complete forms asking for specific details of their daily life, e.g., personal annual mileage with one&#8217;s own car, via carsharing, bicycling, and public transport or whether they forgo the purchase of new products in favor of second-hand goods.</p>
