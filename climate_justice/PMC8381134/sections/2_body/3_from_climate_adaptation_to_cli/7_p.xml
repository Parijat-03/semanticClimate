Simultaneously it will require the construction of other supplementary and complementary institutions and collectives that can navigate through the dynamic relational worlds of the Himalayas, which are not subservient to national territorial imaginaries. We hope that the required institutional reform is inspired, managed, and orchestrated by liberating the multitudes of climate-society relationships that are currently held hostage by the colonial and Cartesian walls of the Anthropocene.</p>
