<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par24">An altogether different emphasis occurs in the PA and the SDGs. In the PA, &#8220;nationally determined contributions&#8221; are the most recurrent formula. The related national &#8220;climate actions&#8221; are meso-level responses to &#8220;climate change&#8221;. The general focus on the member States that are Parties to the Agreement (PA, preamble) points to the meso-level as the document&#8217;s normative focal system. Also the SDGs &#8220;will respect national policy&#8220;(SDGs, 21). The implementation process outlined by this agenda entails consistency &#8220;with the rights and obligations of States under international law&#8220;(SDGs, 18) and &#8220;national ownership&#8220;of the means for SD (SDGs, 46, 66, 74, 76).</p>
