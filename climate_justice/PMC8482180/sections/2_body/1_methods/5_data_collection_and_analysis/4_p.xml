Before data collection, citizens provide informed consent using the app. To ensure confidentiality, data are encrypted before being stored on smartphones and streamed to servers when the devices establish a Wi-Fi connection. Permissions built into the app are restricted so that the app cannot access personally identifiable information that is present on smartphones (eg, contact lists or network sites visited). MAC address anonymization is used to protect citizen scientists&#8217; data. Citizens are also introduced to the <italic>pause</italic> functionality&#8212;a key privacy component&#8212;which allows participants to disable monitoring for a set duration. In the case of lost or stolen phones, participants do not have to worry about data breaches, as study data on phones are strongly encrypted. Once data have been uploaded, they are stored on the secure University of Saskatchewan servers for 10 years.</p>
