<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0170">Scientific support to climate action is not only about exploring capacity of what, in terms of policy and outcome. It is also about assessing feasibility and desirability, in terms of when, where and especially for whom. The world stands at a critical crossroads, where big investments are needed in supply-side technologies. Policy and business alike are increasingly aware of the huge potential for behaviours and lifestyles to help or hinder the sustainability transitions, and of the need to understand them better before making said investments. An undesired glimpse of a rapid reorganisation in societal and individual behavioural change was experienced with the COVID-19 crisis. However, despite the trauma, lessons can be learnt. In science, many have pointed to the need for a new transitions research agenda that integrates social science and modelling, but few have demonstrated how to coherently do so. In this perspective, we have made an effort to contribute to bridging this gap, by outlining a framework to do this from multiple perspectives and across multiple disciplines.</p>
