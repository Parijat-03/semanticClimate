The fact that there already exist multilateral cooperation entities working on climate action, the authors consider it may be of special interest for policy-makers to analyze the ambition of the&#160;mitigation component from the NDCs of the 21 Mediterranean arch countries under the climate justice prism. This analysis shows whether or not countries&#8217; commitments, individually and as a group, are in line with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global mitigation goal. The analysis is performed by comparing the cumulative emissions that current NDCs would imply by 2030, with the result obtained from the distribution among all countries of the cumulative GHG emission compatible with the 1.5&#176;C temperature scenario. The model used for this distribution is the Model of Climate Justice (MCJ) described by Alcaraz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>), which distributes the global emissions using equality and responsibility criteria considering the historical responsibility from each country.</p>
