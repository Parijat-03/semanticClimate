China, India, Thailand and the Republic of Korea record the most number of urban adaptation initiatives, driven mainly by supportive government policies (Lee and Painter, 2015; Dulal, 2019). The number of actors working on urban adaptation is growing: in addition to national governments and local municipalities, civil society, private-sector actors (Shaw, 2019) and transnational municipal networks (F&#252;nfgeld, 2015) are emerging as important for knowledge brokering, capacity building and financing urban adaptation (Karanth and Archer, 2014; Chu et&#160;al., 2017; Bazaz et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.14" top="426.65"><span x0="306.56" y0="426.65" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 312.02; y0: 426.65; y1: 436.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation options include: (a) infrastructural measures such as building flood protection measures and sea walls, and climate-resilient highways and power infrastructure (Shaw et&#160;al., 2016b; Ho et&#160;al., 2017); (b) sustainable land-use planning through zoning, developing building codes (Knowlton et&#160;al., 2014; Nahiduzzaman et&#160;al., 2015; Rahman et&#160;al., 2016; Ahmed et&#160;al., 2019b); (c) ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as protecting urban green spaces, improving permeability, mangrove restoration in coastal cities, etc. (Brink et&#160;al., 2016; Fink, 2016; Yu et&#160;al., 2018d); (d) relocation and migration out of risk-prone areas (McLeman, 2019; Hauer et&#160;al., 2020; Maharjan et&#160;al., 2020); and (e) disaster management and contingency planning such as through Early warning systems (EWS), improved awareness and preparedness measures (Shaw et&#160;al., 2016a). Asian cities are also focusing on institutional adaptation measures which cut across the five categories mentioned above such as through building capacity and local networks (Anguelovski et&#160;al., 2014; Friend et&#160;al., 2014; Knowlton et&#160;al., 2014), improving awareness (Knowlton et&#160;al., 2014), and putting local research and monitoring mechanisms in place (Lee and Painter, 2015) to enable adaptation.
