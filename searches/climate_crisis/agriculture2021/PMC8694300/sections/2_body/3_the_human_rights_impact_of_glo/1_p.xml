In her opening statement to the 42nd session of the Human Rights Council in 2019, Michele Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned that &#8220;the human rights implications of currently projected levels of global heating are catastrophic.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> She went on to state that &#8220;climate change threatens the effective enjoyment of a range of human rights including those to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self-determination, culture and development.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Consistent with our call for a human rights response to climate change, she added that &#8220;states have a human rights obligation to prevent the foreseeable adverse effects of climate change and ensure that those affected by it, particularly those in vulnerable situations, have access to effective remedies and means of adaptation to enjoy lives of human dignity.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> She reiterated these concerns in 2021 in her statement to the 48th session of the Human Rights Council, stating that as the interlinked crises of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss multiply, &#8220;they will constitute the single greatest challenge to human rights in our era.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
