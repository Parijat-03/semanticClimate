<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par19">In Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, I delineate some steps that US public health and medical institutions, agencies, and organizations could take (but have rarely taken) to foster links between work supporting democratic governance, tackling the climate crisis, and health equity. Articulating these action-oriented practical steps matters because having a positive vision of what to do is as necessary as naming the harms that need to be prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To date, the public health and medical literature remains scarce to non-existent on the health-related and climate-related harms of political gerrymandering and voter suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and, to a lesser degree, the census undercount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We can do better: to advance not only the public health and medical scientific evidence in relation to these issues of subverted democratic governance, but also to apply the existing social science evidence on these powerful drivers of human and planetary health harms and health inequities. For the health of current and future generations, of people and of the other species with whom our lives are interdependent, we can afford no less.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>Practical action steps for civic engagement and democratic governance to promote equitable and integrated policies to address the climate crisis and build health equity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Action steps</th><th align="left">Resources</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>(1) Promote voter registration</p><p>&#160;<italic>Action</italic> Provide information about voter registration to staff, patients, members, and study participants</p><p>&#160;<italic>Who should take action</italic> public health and medical agencies, facilities, schools, professional associations, non-profit organizations, and scientific studies</p></td><td align="left">A non-partisan guide on how to register to vote in one&#8217;s state is provided by the League of Women Voters; see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.vote411.org/">https://www.vote411.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(2) Promote an accurate Census 2020 count</p><p>&#160;<italic>Action</italic> Provide information about the importance of the census count to staff, patients, members, and study participants</p><p>&#160;<italic>Who should take action</italic> public health and medical agencies, facilities, schools, professional associations, non-profit organizations, and scientific studies</p></td><td align="left">The US Census Bureau has a website explaining why it is important to participate in the decennial Census (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://2020census.gov/en/what-is-2020-census.html">https://2020census.gov/en/what-is-2020-census.html</ext-link>) and it has established partnerships in communities throughout the US to encourage participation for an accurate count (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/complete_count.html">https://census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/complete_count.html</ext-link>).
