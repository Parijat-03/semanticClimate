<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Consistent with Henry Shue&#8217;s first principle of equity, we propose that the funding for climate reparations come from the countries and private corporations most responsible historically for the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that have caused the present climate crisis, along with the countries contributing the highest current levels of emissions that are intensifying climate change. Reflecting Shue&#8217;s second principle of equity, these countries and corporations also have the greatest means to do so.<sup><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> In line with Shue&#8217;s third principle, this funding scheme for climate reparations would avoid making those who are already worst off even worse off. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to impose reparations charges on low-income countries. We would leave the precise formula as to how to levy these sources of funding to the leaders of the GCRF.</p>
