Collective action is a&#160;result of social capital. Social capital is divided into structural and cognitive forms: structural corresponding to strong networks (including outside one&#8217;s immediate community); and cognitive encompassing mutual trust and cooperation within communities (van Rijn et al. 2012; Woolcock and Narayan 2000). Social capital is more important for economic growth in settings with weak formal institutions, and less so in those with strong enforcement of formal institutions (Ahlerup et al. 2009). There are cases throughout </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.81" top="735.6"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 320.58; y0: 735.6; y1: 745.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.6" x1="565.81">the drylands showing that community by-laws and collective action successfully limited land degradation and facilitated SLM (Ajayi et al. 2016; Infante 2017; Kassie et al. 2013; Nyangena 2008; Willy and Holm-M&#252;ller 2013; Wossen et al. 2015). However, there are also cases when they did not improve SLM where they were not strictly enforced (Teshome et al. 2016). Collective action for implementing responses to dryland degradation is often hindered by local asymmetric power relations and &#8216;elite capture&#8217; (Kihiu 2016; Stringer et al. 2007). This illustrates that different levels and types of social capital result in different levels of collective action. In a&#160;sample of East, West and southern African countries, structural social capital in the form of access to networks outside one&#8217;s own community was suggested to stimulate the adoption of agricultural innovations, whereas cognitive social capital, associated with inward-looking community norms of trust and cooperation, was found to have a&#160;negative relationship with the adoption of agricultural innovations (van Rijn et al. 2012). The latter is indirectly corroborated by observations of the impact of community-based rangeland management organisations in Mongolia. Although levels of cognitive social capital did not differ between them, communities with strong links to outside networks were able to apply more innovative rangeland management practices in comparison to communities without such links (Ulambayar et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="417.47" top="459.64"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.16; y0: 459.64; y1: 469.14; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.77" y0="459.64" x1="417.47">Farmer-led innovations. </span><span style="x0: 420.88; x1: 426.33; y0: 459.64; y1: 469.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="420.88" y0="459.64" x1="565.79">Agricultural households are not just passive adopters of externally developed technologies, but are active experimenters and innovators (Reij and Waters-Bayer 2001; Tambo and W&#252;nscher 2015; Waters-Bayer et al. 2009).

Usually farmer-driven innovations are more frugal and better adapted to their resource scarcities than externally introduced technologies (Gupta et al. 2016). Farmer-to-farmer sharing of their own innovations and mutual learning positively contribute to higher technology adoption rates (Dey et al. 2017). This innovative ability can be given a&#160;new dynamism by combining it with emerging external technologies. For example, emerging low-cost phone applications&#160;(&#8216;apps&#8217;) that are linked to soil and water monitoring sensors can provide farmers with previously inaccessible information and guidance (Cornell et al. 2013; Herrick et al. 2017; McKinley et al. 2017; Steger et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.84" top="243.66"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.87; y0: 243.66; y1: 253.16; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="243.66" x1="565.84">Currently, the adoption of SLM practices remains insuf&#64257;cient to address deserti&#64257;cation and contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation more extensively. This is due to the constraints on the use of indigenous and local knowledge and collective action, as well as economic and institutional barriers for SLM adoption (Banadda 2010; Cordingley et al. 2015; Lokonon and Mbaye 2018; Mulinge et al. 2016; Wildemeersch et al. 2015) (Section&#160;3.1.4.2;&#160;3.6.3). Sustainable development of drylands under these socio-economic and environmental (climate change, deserti&#64257;cation) conditions will also depend on the ability of dryland agricultural households to diversify their livelihoods sources (Boserup 1965; Safriel and Adeel 2008).</span></div></body></html>
