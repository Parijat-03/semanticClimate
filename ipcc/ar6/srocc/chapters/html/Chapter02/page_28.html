Such processes affected engineered structures such as buildings, hazard protection structures, roads, or rail lines in all high mountains during recent decades (Section&#160;2.3.4). Movement of frozen slopes and ground subsidence/heave are strongly related to ground temperature, ice content, and water input (Wirz et al., 2016; Kenner et al., 2017). Where massive ground ice gets exposed, retrogressive thaw erosion develops (Niu et al., 2012). The creep of rock glaciers (frozen debris tongues that slowly deform under gravity) is in principle expected to accelerate in response to rising ground temperatures, until substantial volumetric ice contents have melted out (K&#228;&#228;b et al., 2007; Arenson et al., 2015a). As documented for instance for sites in the European Alps and Scandinavia for recent years to decades, rock glaciers replenished debris &#64258;ow starting zones at their fronts, so that the intensi&#64257;ed material supply associated with accelerated movement (Section&#160;2.2.4) contributed to increased debris &#64258;ow activity (higher frequency, larger magnitudes) or slope destabilisation (Stoffel and Graf, 2015; Wirz et al., 2016; Kummert et al., 2017; Eriksen et al., 2018). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="348.57" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="387.56" x1="348.57">There is </span><span style="x0: 349.22; x1: 353.8; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="349.22" y0="387.56" x1="409.14">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 409.79; x1: 412.6; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="409.79" y0="387.56" x1="566.13">that the frequency of rocks detaching and falling from steep slopes (rock fall) has increased within zones of degrading permafrost over the past half-century, for instance in high mountains in North America, New Zealand, and Europe (Allen et al., 2011; Ravanel and Deline, 2011; Fischer et al., 2012; Coe et al., 2017). Compared to the SREX and AR5 reports, the con&#64257;dence in this &#64257;nding increased. Available &#64257;eld evidence agrees with theoretical considerations and calculations that permafrost thaw increases the likelihood of rock fall (and also rock avalanches, which have larger volumes compared to rock falls) (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007; Krautblatter et al., 2013). These conclusions are also supported by observed ice in the detachment zone of previous events in North America, Iceland and Europe (Geertsema et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2017; S&#230;mundsson et al., 2018). Summer heat waves have in recent years triggered rock instability with delays of only a few days or weeks in the European Alps (Allen and Huggel, 2013; Ravanel et al., 2017). This is in line with theoretical considerations about fast thaw of ice &#64257;lled frozen fractures in bedrock (Hasler et al., 2011) and other climate impacts on rock stability, such as from large temperature variations (Luethi et al., 2015). Similarly, permafrost thaw increased the frequency and volumes of landslides from frozen sediments in many mountain regions in recent decades (Wei et al., 2006; Ravanel et al., 2010; Lacelle et al., 2015). At lower elevations in the French Alps, though, climate driven changes such as a reduction in number of freezing days are projected to lead to a reduction in debris &#64258;ows (Jomelli et al., 2009).</span></div></body></html>
