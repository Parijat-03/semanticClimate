The U.S. electric sector is complex, with variation across states in the degree to which utilities are private corporations (known as &#8220;investor-owned utilities&#8221;) or customer-owned utilities, which can either be government-owned or electricity cooperatives (Greenberg &amp; McKendry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>). However, most U.S. residents receive electricity from investor-owned utilities (IOUs) rather than from public or cooperative organizations (U.S. Energy Information Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2017</xref>). States vary in the degree to which they undertook efforts to break up vertically integrated utilities and introduce retail competition beginning in the late 1990s (Borenstein and Bushnell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>), and this variation led to differences in how these actors came to view climate policy proposals (Basseches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>).</p>
