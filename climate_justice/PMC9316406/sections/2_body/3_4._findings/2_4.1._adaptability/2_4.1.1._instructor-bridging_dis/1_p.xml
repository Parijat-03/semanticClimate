Since the discipline of social work is rooted in social justice [<xref rid="B61-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], connecting social justice and environmental/climate justice creates an accessible platform for students to be more mindful of environmental and climatological impacts on their client&#8217;s holistic health and well-being. This connection supports students in adapting their previous training regarding the effects of social injustice on human health and well-being and conceptualizing these impacts in the context of environmental and man-made crises. PIE-oriented reflection can help students examine their personal experiences to develop their comprehension. For instance, how would eco-anxiety worsen clients&#8217; already weak health status? How would structural social injustice and environmental/climate pressures that a family may be experiencing collectively affect this family&#8217;s mental health and well-being? This training will build the students&#8217; adaptability to utilize GSW interventions that promote grassroots health and well-being. </p>
