While there is a strong consensus that some extreme weather events have increased as a result of climate change (USGCRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>), the authors caution that this also reflects the increasing impacts to infrastructure systems and people (i.e., more people in an area results in&#160;more stuff being damaged when a disaster occurs). Additionally, as population grows and disparities continue, more vulnerable populations are being exposed at higher rates and severity with climatic changes.
