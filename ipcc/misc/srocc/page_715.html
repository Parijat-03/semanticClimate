In the original design of the ETS in 2008, agriculture was intended to be included from 2013, but successive governments deferred the inclusion (Kerr and Sweet 2008) due to concerns about competitiveness, lack of mitigation options and the level of opposition from those potentially affected (Cooper and Rosin 2014). Now though, as the country&#8217;s agricultural emissions are 12% above 1990 levels, and the country&#8217;s total gross emissions have increased 19.6% above 1990 levels (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment 2018), there is a recognition that, without any targeted policy for agriculture, only 52% of the country&#8217;s emissions face any substantive incentive to mitigate (Narassimhan et al. 2018). Including agriculture in the ETS is one option to provide incentives for emissions reductions in that sector. Other options are discussed in Section&#160;7.4.4. Although some producer groups raise concern that including agriculture will place New Zealand producers at a disadvantage compared with their international competitors who do not face similar mechanisms (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018), there is generally greater acceptance of the need for climate policies for agriculture.</span></div><div left="79.37" right="164.84" top="543.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 543.54; y1: 553.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="543.54" x1="164.84">The inclusion of non-CO</span><span style="x0: 164.84; x1: 168.03; y0: 542.21; y1: 548.86; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="164.84" y0="542.21" x1="168.03">2</span><span style="x0: 170.12; x1: 174.34; y0: 543.52; y1: 553.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="170.12" y0="543.52" x1="557.62">emissions from agriculture within an ETS is potentially complex, however, due to the large number of buyers and sellers if obligations are placed at farm level, and different choices of how to estimate emissions from biological systems in cost-effective ways. New Zealand is currently investigating practical and equitable approaches to include agriculture through advice being provided by the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC 2018). Main questions centre around the point of obligation for buying and selling credits, where trade-offs have to be made between providing incentives for behaviour change at farm level and the cost and complexity of administering the scheme (Agriculture Technical Advisory Group 2009; Kerr and Sweet 2008). The two potential points of obligation are at the processor level or at the individual farm level. Setting the point of obligation at the processor level means that farmers would face limited incentive to change their management practices, unless the processors themselves rewarded farmers for lowered emissions. Setting it at the individual farm level would provide a direct incentive for farmers to adopt mitigation practices, however, the reality of having thousands of individual points of obligation would&#160;be&#160;administratively complex and could result in high transaction costs (Beca Ltd 2018).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.56" top="399.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.76; y0: 399.54; y1: 409.04; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="399.54" x1="557.56">Monitoring, reporting and veri&#64257;cation (MRV) of agricultural emissions presents another challenge, especially if emissions have to be&#160;estimated at farm level.

Methane is a&#160;short-lived gas with a perturbation lifetime of 12 years in the atmosphere; nitrous oxide on the other hand is a long-lived gas and remains in the atmosphere for 114 years (Allen et al. 2016). Long-lived gases have a cumulative and essentially irreversible effect on the climate (IPCC 2014b) so their emissions need to reduce to net-zero in order to avoid climate change. Short-lived gases, however, could potentially be reduced to a certain level and then stabilised, and would not contribute further to warming, leading to suggestions of treating these two gases separately in the ETS or alternative policy instruments, possibly setting different budgets and targets for each (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018). Reisinger et al. (2013) demonstrate that different metrics can have important implications globally and potentially at national and regional scales on the costs and levels of abatement. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.55" top="219.56"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.93; y0: 219.56; y1: 229.06; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="219.56" x1="557.55">While the details are still being agreed on in New Zealand, almost 80% of nationally determined contributions committed to action on mitigation in agriculture (FAO 2016), so countries will be looking for successful examples. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="183.57"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 183.57; y1: 193.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="183.57" x1="557.6">Australia&#8217;s Emissions Reduction Fund, and the preceding Carbon Farming Initiative, are examples of baseline-and-credit schemes, which creates credits for activities that generate emissions below a baseline &#8211; effectively a&#160;subsidy (Freebairn 2016).

Key success factors in the design of such an instrument are policy-certainty for at least 10 to 20years, regulation that focuses on projects and not uniform rules, automated systems for all phases of the projects, and a wider focus of the carbon farming initiative on adaptation, food security, sustainable farm business, and creating jobs (Verschuuren 2017).
