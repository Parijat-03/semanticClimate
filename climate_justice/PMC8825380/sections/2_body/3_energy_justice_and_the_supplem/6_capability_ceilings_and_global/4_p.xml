According to most estimates, current levels are well beyond safe boundaries. During the period 1970 to 2015, the global primary energy consumption increased from 223.35 EJ to 525.49 EJ the majority of which comes from fossil fuels (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>: 240ff). The lack of action from one generation will result in required intensified efforts by subsequent generations to limit the effects of dangerous climate change. Many could reduce their carbon footprint without being pushed below the threshold level while still allowing the least well-off to increase their emissions, and thus their HDI and by extension (some of) their capabilities, being a non-tragic choice. Doing so would make it possible to reduce dangerous climate change in addition to enabling the least well-off of that generation to increase their emissions and well-being. Given that the relation between HDI and energy consumption is that of a diminishing marginal utility, very small increases in energy consumption for the least well-off would result in significant increases in HDI.</p>
