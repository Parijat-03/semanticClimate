Unlike the earlier pathways, climate change does not directly cause air pollution, although the two have mutually reinforcing effects. Instead, the sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as fossil fuel burning electricity generation and transportation, are also the same sources of air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Exposure to air pollution is a major risk factor for a wide range of chronic non-communicable diseases including heart disease, asthma exacerbations, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. When exposed to high levels of air pollution, HIV patients can be more susceptible to acquiring these diseases as well as suffering from more severe outcomes. The main mechanism through which air pollution brings about or exacerbates cardiorespiratory diseases is through local and systemic inflammation as well as increased oxidative stress [<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During HIV infection, oxidative stress is much worsened due to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in monocytes and reduction in total antioxidant capacity in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<italic>-</italic>lymphocytes <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
