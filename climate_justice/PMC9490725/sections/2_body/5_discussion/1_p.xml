<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par56">The business ethics literature shows how regulation of the environmental impacts of business has moved from command-and-control to voluntary approaches to MBMs. MBMs not only have their own technical and fundamental flaws, but they are used to silence and depoliticise alternatives. The maritime case showed how MBMs were neither accepted nor rejected a decade ago, and have now returned to the table because alternatives are invisible. This finding supports the work of Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>) on the power of non-decision. The attempt to depoliticise maritime emissions by assigning them to the IMO rather than individual countries has weakened direct links to responsibility and allowed ongoing discussion by private actors behind closed doors. Yet the case also identified an interesting tension between the short-term perspective of private actors blocking regulation and a potential medium-term acceptance of a changing policy landscape as some shipping lines have called for decarbonisation by 2050. This tension reflects the findings of Mullin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002</xref>) and Burress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>) regarding the potential for sectoral change according to the perspective of key actors on the likely policy direction.</p>
