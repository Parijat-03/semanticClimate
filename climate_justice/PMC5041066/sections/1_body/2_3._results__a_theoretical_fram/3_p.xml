<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The aim of this proposed framework is to aid in assessing whether adaptation targets current inequities and determinants of health that may reduce unequally distributed health outcomes. To evaluate health-related climate change adaptation for its climate justice contribution, the theoretical framework draws from two main concepts: (i) health inequity [<xref rid="B48-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and (ii) resilience to climatic changes [<xref rid="B51-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In more detail, these two concepts can be illustrated using seven domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="healthcare-04-00065-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which illustrate variables and contents with which to measure possible climate justice advancement. Susan Cutter et al. [<xref rid="B53-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] describe six of these domains which are relevant to disaster resilience: social, economic, infrastructure, institutional, community, and environmental domains. As current research shows that culture can limit or facilitate &#8220;opportunities to become healthier&#8221; [<xref rid="B54-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], we propose adding culture as a further domain. Together, these seven domainns cover the range of likely determinants of human health potentially affected by climate change. They serve as the overarching evaluation frame. <xref ref-type="table" rid="healthcare-04-00065-t001">Table 1</xref> supplements this framework by providing an overview over possible operational indicators for each area (adapted from [<xref rid="B6-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B53-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]).</p>
