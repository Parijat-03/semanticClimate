      <td>Agriculture in Ladakh, a cold arid mountain region (~100,000 km2) in the western Himalaya of India with median elevation of 3,350 m\na.s.l. and mean annual precipitation of less than 100 mm, is highly dependent on streams for irrigation in the agricultural season in the\nspring and summer (N&#252;sser et al., 2012; Barrett and Bosak, 2018). Glaciers in Ladakh, largely located at 5,000&#8211;6,000 m a.s.l. and small\nin size have retreated at least since the late 1960s although less pronounced than in many other Himalayan regions (Chudley et al.,\n2017; Schmidt and N&#252;sser, 2017). However, the effect of glaciers on streamflow in Ladakh is poorly constrained, and measurements\non changes in runoff and snow cover are lacking (N&#252;sser et al., 2018).</td>

      <td>To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for irrigation, villagers in the region have developed four types of artificial ice\nreservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in the\nautumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and flows down to fields (Clouse et al., 2017; N&#252;sser\net al., 2018). In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual flow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased\nflow in the following spring (Vince, 2009; Shaheen, 2016). Frozen basins are formed from water which is conveyed across a slope\nthrough channels and check dams to shaded surface depressions near the villages. Cascades and diversions direct water to pass over\nstone walls, slowing its movement and allowing it to freeze. Ice stupas direct water through pipes into fountains, where it freezes\ninto conical shapes (Box 2.3 Figure 1). These techniques use local materials and draw on local knowledge (N&#252;sser and Baghel, 2016).</td>

      <td>A study examined 14 ice reservoirs, including ice stupas, and concluded that they serve as &#8216;site-specific water conservation strategies;\nand that they can be regarded as appropriate local technologies to reduce seasonal water scarcity at critical times (N&#252;sser et al.,\n2018). It listed the benefits of ice reservoirs as improved water availability in spring, reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting\ncrop failure risks, and the possibility of growing cash crops. However, the study questioned their usefulness as a long-term adaptation\nstrategy, because their operation depends on winter runoff and freeze-thaw cycles, both of which are sensitive to interannual\nvariability, and often deviate from the optimum range required for effective functioning of the reservoirs. It also raised questions\nabout the financial costs and labour requirements, which vary across the four types of ice reservoirs.</td>
