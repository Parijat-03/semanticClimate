      <td>valuation; and that the NCP concept is not useful for policy uptake (Braat 2018; Peterson et al. 2018). Others have argued that the\nMA&#8217;s approach is outdated, does not explicitly address biodiversity, and confuses different concepts, like economic goods, ecosystem\nfunctions, and general benefits (Boyd and Banzhaf 2007). Moreover, for both ES and NCP approaches, it has been difficult to make\ncomplex ecological processes and functions amenable to assessments that can be used and compared across wider landscapes,\ndifferent policy actors, and multiple stakeholders (de Groot et al. 2002; Naeem et al. 2015; Seppelt et al. 2011). There remain\ncompeting categorisation schemes for ES, as well as competing metrics on how most ES might be measured (Wallace 2007;\nPotschin and Haines-Young 2011; Danley and Widmark 2016; Nahlik et al. 2012). The implications of these discussions for this SRCCL\nreport is that many areas of uncertainty remain with regard to much ES/NCP measurement and valuation, which will have ramifications\nfor choosing response options and policies.</td>

      <td>This report addresses ES/NCP in multiple ways. Individual chapters have used the term &#8216;ES&#8217; in most cases, especially since the\npreponderance of existing literature uses the ES terminology. For example, Chapter 2 discusses CO fluxes, nutrients and water budgets\n2\nas important ES deriving from land&#8211;climate interactions. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss issues such as biomass production, soil erosion,\nbiodiversity loss, and other ES affected by land-use change. Chapter 5 discusses both ES and NCP issues surrounding food system\nprovisioning and trade-offs.</td>

      <td>In Chapter 6, the concept of NCP is used. For example, Tables 6.70 to 6.72, possible response options to respond to climate change,\nto address land degradation or desertification, and to ensure food security, are cross-referenced against the 18 NCPs identified by D&#237;az\net al. (2018) to see where there are co-benefits and adverse side effects. For instance, while BECCS may deliver on climate mitigation, it\nresults in a number of adverse side effects that are significant with regard to water provisioning, food and feed availability, and loss of\nsupporting identities if BECCS competes against local land uses of cultural importance. Chapter 7 has Section 7.2.2.2, explicitly covering\nrisks due to loss of biodiversity and ES, and Table 7.1 which includes policy responses to various land&#8211;climate&#8211;society hazards, some of\nwhich are likely to enhance risk of loss of biodiversity and ES. A case study on the impact of renewable energy on biodiversity and ES is\nalso included. Chapter 7 also notes that, because there is no Sustainable Development Goal covering freshwater biodiversity and aquatic\necosystems, this policy gap may have adverse consequences for the future of rivers and associated ES.</td>
