<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0390">Ideally, an emphasis for resilience should reinforce conditions for enabling sustainable development. Resilience considerations may apply to multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is possible to imagine situations where an emphasis on local-level resilience may be at odds with larger-scale resilience and sustainability concerns, or vice versa. Hence, when resilience concepts are being operationalized, the interactions among the various components of the food system need to be kept in mind. Among the questions needing to be asked are resilience of what and for whom? Potential trade-offs between social, economic, and environmental resilience and sustainability concerns need to be addressed. The lock-in of food system structures, which meet current demands, but are unsustainable or maladaptive to trends, should be avoided. This would ultimately exacerbate vulnerabilities of livelihoods and economic activities over time. Hence, resilience concepts should take into account multiple risks, be considered in their implications across scales, and include an emphasis on adaptation and transformation where this becomes necessary (<xref rid="bb0555" ref-type="bibr">Tendall et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
