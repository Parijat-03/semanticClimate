entities such as the healthcare system that commenters think should have taken
more responsible actions in response to the pandemic. Specifically, in the
context of the lack of accessibility to COVID testing, one physician wrote: &#8220;As
a physician, I am appalled at the delivery system for valid coronavirus tests in
comparison to competent medical systems like South Korea who have rapid-result
and drive-through testing.&#8221; Other comments focused on the sluggish vaccine
distribution process, one commenter complained: &#8220;Most vaccination centers have
little if any vaccine stocks, opening more will not help unless vaccines can be
sent to them by the hundreds of millions.&#8221;</p>
