<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The Pliocene Epoch is the more recent of two epochs of the Neogene Period within the <em>Cenozoic Era</em>.</p>
<p>It extends from 5.33 Ma to the beginning of the <em>Pleistocene</em> Epoch at 2.59 Ma. The Neogene Period precedes the current geological period, the <em>Quaternary</em> Period, which is one of several ice ages that have occurred during Earthâ€™s geological history. It encompasses the mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP), also known as the Piacenzian warm period, which occurred from approximately 3.3 to 3.0 Ma. The MPWP, in turn, encompasses the interglacial episode, marine isotope stage (MIS) KM5c, which peaked at 3.205 Ma, when orbital forcing was similar to modern (Haywood et al., 2016).</p>
