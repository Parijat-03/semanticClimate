It involves securing an integrated national economy complemented with global engagement, including competing with foreign agribusiness, to enhance China&#8217;s global political-economic power in the long run. The rural economy and peasantry symbolize China&#8217;s renaissance, beginning in 1949 with the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC). And even as Xi has stepped up &#8216;agricultural modernization&#8217;, enabling competition with foreign agribusiness, China&#8217;s historic land reform stabilizes much of its home-grown agrarian sector.</p>
