<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par4">Accordingly, various authors have recently argued that a lack of relationality is at the core of many of our current crises, and describe what may be considered an emerging paradigm informed by relational thinking using different terms and concepts, such as the ecological paradigm (Ulanowicz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2009</xref>; H&#246;rl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>), systems approach (Capra and Luisi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>), integral theory (Wilber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1996</xref>), metamodernism (Freinacht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>), and constructive postmodernism (Cobb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>). As relationality has become a buzz word with many meanings, however, it is unclear whether different relational thinkers share linked assumptions that constitute an emerging paradigm and to what degree they relate to sustainability.</p>
