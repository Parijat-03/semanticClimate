Some were also arrested for civil disobedience that day, others not. This injunction was initiated to clear the path for constructing a pipeline owned (then) by a Texan oil company, Kinder Morgan (the parent company linked to the infamous Enron scandals), to triple levels of diluted bitumen (heavy oil) flowing through hundreds of kilometres of land from Alberta's tar sands in the interior (see <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 2020</xref>), through Indigenous territory, to the BC west coast. The project was one that candidate-Justin Trudeau, when campaigning to be Prime Minister, publicly argued needed a whole new review process &#8211; including assessing climate risks and other aspects &#8211; before he later reversed his stance, asserting a new &#8216;national interest&#8217; imperative to build the pipeline (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Dalby, 2019</xref>).</p>
