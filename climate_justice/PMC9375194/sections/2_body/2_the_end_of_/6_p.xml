Several years ago, while in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, my daughter and I visited the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca and its Hall of Mass Extinctions, where we learned that as bad as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event of 66&#160;million years ago was for some species, life on earth has seen much worse. The most recent mass extinction, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, is famous for wiping out the dinosaurs&#8212;and 75% of all life&#8212;after a massive asteroid or comet collided with the earth. But almost 200&#160;million years earlier, the Permian-Triassic extinction event, otherwise known as the Great Dying, nearly brought a complete end to life on earth. Thought to have been triggered by erupting super-volcanos in Siberia (the Siberian Traps region), the Permian event wiped out all but 4% of marine species. And yet, almost miraculously, the planet somehow endured, and life eventually recovered, but not for millions of years.</p>
