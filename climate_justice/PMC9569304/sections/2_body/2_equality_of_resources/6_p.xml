This is exactly what Paul Bou-Habib and Serena Olsaretti have done: they have extended the Dworkinian hypothetical insurance scheme to second-order preferences of first-order preferences about the good life.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> Making use of a hypothetical insurance scheme that would provide funds for the costs of adequate child-rearing if we decide to have children, Bou-Habib and Olsaretti make the argument that the state must provide parental subsidies to the extent that individuals would, under suitable hypothetical conditions, choose to buy such insurance. While this proposal provides a justification for societal support for parents, it still imposes the Dworkinian distinction between choices and endowments upon our normative analysis. Procreative parenting is still understood as merely a choice that is based on one&#8217;s preferences&#8212;with the modification that it is now regarded as a choice that we find so important that we are willing to insure ourselves for the risk that we might want to become parents yet may not have enough resources to do so.</p>
