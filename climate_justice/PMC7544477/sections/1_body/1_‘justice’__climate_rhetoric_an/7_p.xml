Studying courtroom dynamics around the TMX project indeed brings forward diverse possibilities and dilemmas for grounding ideas of injustice; different timelines, subjectivities, power relations and material concerns may be prioritised. While thousands of people have expressed resistance, this has been in many ways, for many reasons. For some, opposition is a response to concerns that the 7-fold increase in oil tanker traffic right in the Vancouver harbour poses a serious threat to local populations from a spill in this area; for others, effects of tanker traffic on BC's west coast endangering the orca populations is a major motivator, for some, the pipeline's impacts on salmon figures prominently; and for many, including scientists willing to be arrested, increased greenhouse gas emissions that would result from expanded oil exports is central, framing opposition to a global climate disaster as the lead issue. The pipeline also represents the continued destruction of Indigenous health, food sovereignty and wellbeing on local scales, with oil impacts already having been shown to have serious consequences in undermining Indigenous health and food sources (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Jonasson et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
