For example, reducing school social worker positions and downsizing or eliminating non-profit agencies&#8217; programming can threaten a school&#8217;s community hub role discussed above, further jeopardizing community-based social services. This has a particularly negative impact on vulnerable community residents. Community-based social work efforts advocate community engagement and empowerment in preparing communities to respond to potential climate-related and other disasters. Hence, this advocacy role of social workers in non-disaster settings can inform the related governmental interventions to be more aware of the significance of community engagement and can strengthen the community&#8217;s coping capacity for potential disasters, while contributing to healthy, resilient, and sustainable community development.</p>
