To prevent the spread of this virus, governments halted many economic activities so that people would sequester at home. The decline in the consumption of petroleum and other fossil fuels has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which resulted in things that most living people had never before witnessed. Another consequence of coronavirus disease is a slight deceleration of global warming. The First-quarter 2020 global daily CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from surface transport, power, and industry fell by 36%, 7.4%, and 19%, respectively, relative to the annual mean daily emissions in 2019. If they grow accustomed to these adjustments, oil consumption is likely to decline and investment in oil extraction will no longer be profitable. This radical interruption of the global economic system has made a serious move toward a greener economy.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Air pollution</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Greenhouse gases</kwd><kwd>Global warming</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0015"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0015">In late 2019, Chinese doctors and health researchers announced that they were facing a new virus, the dimensions of which were mysteries to them.

The COVID-19 crisis has affected several energy markets, including coal, natural gas, and renewable energy, but its impact on the oil market has been severe. This was most apparent in China because it accounted for 80% of the world's energy demand growth in 2019.<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> The EIA estimates that COVID-19 will reduce the demand for oil and other liquid fuels in China by an average of 190,000 barrels per day. China bought about 200,000 barrels of oil per day from the United States, while US oil exports were 8.5 million barrels per day. A few weeks after the outbreak in China, oil consumption fell by 20%, impacting a considerable number of oil companies. Fifty million people in China's Hubei Province no longer consume oil.

At least 1.2 million jobs in Europe are directly dependent on car production, which are now in jeopardy in the wake of factory closures.

Some think that climate changes occasionally occur on Earth and have nothing to do with them. Currently, practically, no part of the world is immune to COVID-19, and this is also true of global warming and the prospects for changing climates. COVID-19 has created an opportunity for solidarity among all people that have never been seen before. This is precisely the tool that must be used to deal with climate change. The principle that prevention is better than treatment, a fixed rule in health and medicine, should be adopted to slow global warming and reduce climate change. It will be much easier to challenge the momentum of global warming now, than, it will be to deal with the enormous consequences we face with changing climates. In the post-COVID-19 world, economic redevelopment has become a priority for environmental concerns. The people and governments of the world, by staying at home, forgoing demonstrations, and caring for and protecting each other, have shown that they can unite to prevent disasters and save humanity. The same decisive spirit is needed to deal with climate crises. However, there is a risk that if people abandon public transportation because of the perceived health threat, it poses and returns to their cars, greenhouse gas emissions will be higher than before. Plans should be drawn to encourage people to invest in renewable and low-carbon energy sources. Today's reduced carbon emissions are temporary because there is insufficient infrastructure to migrate to primary reliance on renewable energy; we remain dependent on fossil fuels. We find ourselves (inadvertently) in the world's most massive experiment to reduce, if not halt, the combustion of carbon. However, the oil industry has been the primary engine of technological progress and innovation for decades, and it will be challenging to dispense with it, if not overcome its political power, to achieve clean energy. Clean air and stable climates will only return when we move to make concerted commitments and changes to develop low-carbon economies in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ac0010"><sec id="s0010"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0010">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="bi0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0010"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Economic Times</surname></name></person-group><article-title>First COVID-19 case can be traced back to November 17 in China's Hubei province: Report</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/first-covid-19-case-can-be-traced-back-to-november-2017-in-chinas-hubei-province-report/articleshow/74608199.cms" id="ir0320">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/first-covid-19-case-can-be-traced-back-to-november-2017-in-chinas-hubei-province-report/articleshow/74608199.cms</ext-link><year>2020</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>WHO</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://apps.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/mers-cov/en/index.html" id="ir0330">https://apps.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/mers-cov/en/index.html</ext-link><year>2018</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>WHO</surname></name></person-group><article-title>WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dashboard</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/" id="ir0340">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link><year>2020</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0025"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0025"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Malla</surname><given-names>M.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubey</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>With corona outbreak: nature started hitting the reset button globally</article-title><source>Front Public Health</source><volume>8</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>569353</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3389/fpubh.2020.569353</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33072704</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0030"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="rf0030"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brenchley</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Report from the Asian Development Bank: Coronavirus could cost global economy $8.8trn</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news/4015244/asian-development-bank-coronavirus-cost-global-economy-usd-8trn" id="ir0350">https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news/4015244/asian-development-bank-coronavirus-cost-global-economy-usd-8trn</ext-link><year>2020</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0035"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0035"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zambrano-Monserrate</surname><given-names>M.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruano</surname><given-names>M.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez-Alcalde</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment</article-title><source>Sci Total Environ</source><volume>728</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>138813</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32334159</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0040"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="rf0040"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Paula</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mar</surname><given-names>K.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is the Coronavirus &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; for climate change?
