Because governments are reacting too slowly, grassroots collective action is key. Understanding the psychological factors underpinning engagement can facilitate the growth of such collective action. Yet, previous research in psychology rarely provided causal evidence for which factors trigger action, lacked focus on the climate crisis, was mostly self-reported behaviour or intentions rather than objective measures, and was mostly cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Here we conducted a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of a 12-week video intervention designed to increase psychological predictors of collective action. The intervention boosted affective engagement, collective efficacy, and self-efficacy, but did not increase observed attendance of activism events. Interviews suggested that Zoom fatigue and the online study design undercut the social interaction participants wanted in order to join events. However, a smaller in-person replication did not increase activism either. Debriefings suggested that the replication participants were primarily motivated by payment and lacked time or resources for more engagement. These results highlight the crucial importance of going beyond measures of self-reported attitudes or intentions to objectively measuring activism behaviours and showing the difficulty of fostering event attendance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>activism</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>collective action</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>pro-environmental behaviour</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>prosocial behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source>

In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), backed by the world's governments, urged a reduction of emissions of 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels to keep heating to relatively safe levels [<xref rid="RSOS210006C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in land use, energy systems, buildings and transportation [<xref rid="RSOS210006C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, after 30 years of international talks, there is no binding treaty on emission reductions, nor are most governments doing enough locally [<xref rid="RSOS210006C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An alternative avenue is for collective action movements to grow at the grassroots, which will eventually lead to political pressure [<xref rid="RSOS210006C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While such groups do already exist (e.g. Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org and Fridays for Future), the overall membership is still small. In this study, we aim to better understand the psychological factors that drive individuals to join collective action.</p><p>Research in this area has mostly focused on broader environmental concerns, with only a few studies specifically related to climate change. Based on a non-systematic review [<xref rid="RSOS210006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we identified a dozen psychological factors that relate to self-reported environmental activism, where this includes joining events organized by ecologically oriented groups, and engaging in environmental education and leadership behaviors (such as circulation of petitions, raising awareness about climate issues, outreach and community organizing; [<xref rid="RSOS210006C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS210006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). The findings emerged in diverse geographical locations (although predominantly white, developed western nations were studied), ranging across Germany [<xref rid="RSOS210006C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Austria [<xref rid="RSOS210006C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the USA [<xref rid="RSOS210006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Australia [<xref rid="RSOS210006C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and other countries such as Argentina, Chile, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and others [<xref rid="RSOS210006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We identified psychological factors including affective engagement (i.e. anxiety, sense of threat, worry and concern about the environment and ecological extinction), worldviews, i.e. egalitarian [<xref rid="RSOS210006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], nature-loving [<xref rid="RSOS210006C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and anti-consumerist beliefs [<xref rid="RSOS210006C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], collective efficacy (i.e. the perception that the actions of one's group can have an impact) and social norms (i.e. the perceived approval of one's engagement in activism from people in one's social circle; [<xref rid="RSOS210006C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p><p>While this literature provides important clues about these key psychological factors, the studies are subject to four key limitations. First, there is a <italic toggle="yes">lack of causal evidence</italic>. Almost all studies were cross-sectional (i.e. the relation between self-reports of psychological factors and people's activism was only measured at one time point). For example, in a nationally representative survey conducted in 2008 [<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], participants rated their risk perceptions and collective efficacy about climate change. They then self-reported their past climate actions and their future intentions (e.g. contacting elected officials and attending rallies or meetings). Cross-sectional designs with one time point are appropriate and informative, but only provide weak evidence for causation, which could for example be driven by an unknown third variable.</p><p>Second, there is substantial <italic toggle="yes">noise and bias in self-report measures of activism behaviour</italic>. Many studies measured recall for distant memories of activist behaviour. Measurement noise increases when the recalled events are further back in time, and when the measures do not specify the time or frequency [<xref rid="RSOS210006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Some studies also used unclear categorizations of what kind of activism was done and at what intensity [<xref rid="RSOS210006C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, evidence is emerging that self-reported pro-environmental behaviour is biased due to noisy recall [<xref rid="RSOS210006C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and is also influenced by people exaggerating their green identities when they are observed [<xref rid="RSOS210006C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Third, there is a <italic toggle="yes">lack of climate focus</italic>. Most previous studies on environmental activism were not specifically about climate change. The climate crisis is different from other environmental issues such as plastic waste and local industrial pollution. The climate concern requires acting on a threat that is often invisible, gradual, and long-term [<xref rid="RSOS210006C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS210006C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also global in the sense that local actions are only ultimately effective in concert with massive changes elsewhere. The climate threat is also unusual in that it is so widely distributed as to almost defy comprehension: it is leading to cascading problems across such diverse areas as agriculture and biodiversity, socio-political stability and human health [<xref rid="RSOS210006C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These features indicate unique barriers to participation in climate action, which may require studies specifically on climate activism.</p><p>Fourth, as with any research project, there are also specific <italic toggle="yes">methodological weaknesses</italic> in this area. Almost no studies verified that participants believed key facts about climate change (cf. [<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Without that, it is difficult to interpret the role of a factor like collective efficacy in relation to activism due to a potential for collider bias [<xref rid="RSOS210006C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]: e.g. a person might report high collective efficacy but not engage in climate activism because they do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, which can obscure the role of collective efficacy in a target population believing in climate change. Additionally, many of these studies only measured hypothetical intentions as their outcome variable [<xref rid="RSOS210006C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], rather than objective measures of behaviour. Self-reported pro-environmental behaviours only correlate about <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub>17</sub> = 0.46 with objective measures of the same behaviours [<xref rid="RSOS210006C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><sec id="s1a"><label>1.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Current study</title><p>We designed an online study to address some of these weaknesses. The aim of this study was not to test any particular theory, but rather to develop a novel methodology that clearly identifies which particular psychological factors may cause climate activism. To do this, we introduced two novel tools: (1) an intensive video intervention attempting to boost 11 psychological factors, and (2) a behaviour-tracking methodology to measure actual participation in Zoom activism events organized by two climate organizations.</p><p>Specifically, we conducted a three-month longitudinal study aimed at boosting psychological factors such as collective efficacy and social norms. Although our review of the literature revealed more than a dozen possible psychological factors, we settled on just 11. These both had the most correlational evidence with activism behaviour, and fit our intuitions as climate activists of being relevant. The main goal of our study was to see which psychological factors changed in response to the intervention and to identify which of those changes predict shifts in behaviour. The main measure of activism behaviour in this study was event participation (objectively recorded). We embedded a study team member in the UCSD Green New Deal and SD350 climate groups and verified participation in events held by both organizations. Additionally, self-reported environmental education and leadership behaviour was collected, along with other pro-environmental behaviours relevant to climate change. Finally, a semi-structured interview based on the confirmatory results provided qualitative data about activists' own experiences and perceived barriers.

Based on our earlier experience recruiting student activists through classes and educational materials, we anticipated 30% of participants would join at least one activism event, and half of these participants would develop an enduring commitment.

The drop-out rate was higher than expected: 30% of the participants dropped out before the study began, and 13% dropped out during the three-month study period, so the final sample was <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 96 (22 males, 72 females and 2 unspecified). 20% of the participants were Caucasian, 51% Asian, 18% Hispanic/Latino and 11% had other ethnic/racial backgrounds. 75% of the participants identified as Democrats, 5% as Republicans and 20% as Other.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><label>2.1.4<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Screening survey</title><p>Participants underwent an initial screening for age (18&#x02013;40) and then beliefs in anthropogenic global heating through two questions: &#x02018;Regardless of its cause, I am certain that climate change is actually occurring&#x02019; (yes/no), and &#x02018;Human activities are a significant cause of climate change&#x02019; (yes/no) (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">a</italic>).

To limit this possibility, we ensured people had no history of activism. Being engaged in activism outside our study would have made it more likely for a participant to attend an activist event that we could not track during the study. Therefore, we asked everyone at recruitment if they had ever attended an event organized by an environmental organization (such as a protest). Those answering yes were then asked how many times they attended such an event (once, more than once). 15 participants responding &#x02018;more than once&#x02019; were excluded from the study.</p><p>The remaining participants read an instruction sheet and approved a consent form about the timeline of the study and their responsibilities over the three-month period. This included rules for payment penalties based on not completing the tasks.

To ensure that participants read the events bulletin, they were asked two attention-check questions at the end of each bulletin about the events. Responding incorrectly to more than one question potentially resulted in a $3 penalty for that session ($3 were subtracted from the final payment of $100); however, the participant who failed this check could read the bulletin once more and re-take the test to avoid losing the $3.</p></sec><sec id="s2a6"><label>2.1.6<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Baseline survey (at the end of the baseline period)</title><p>At the end of the baseline period, participants filled out an online survey through Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) measuring: A) 11 psychological factors (1. affective engagement, 2. collective efficacy, 3. perceived behavioural control, 4. social norm, 5. faith in institutions, 6. self-efficacy, 7. identity, 8. attitudes, 9. intentions, 10. openness/imagination, 11. theory of change), B) self-reported activism behaviour and C) demographics (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">c</italic>).</p><sec id="s2a6a"><label>2.1.6.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>11 Psychological factors</title><p>For each factor, participants provided ratings on multiple items.

The intervention consisted of 12 videos, each of which contained a mixture of two or more of the 11 psychological factors of interest.

The choice to build thematic videos, rather than building each video around one of the 11 factors, was done for two reasons: first, we were hoping to repeat the mobilizing effect of Dr Aron's class by adopting its thematic design which has repeatedly motivated students to climate action; and second, to prevent the participants from recognizing too easily in the videos the factors we were trying to boost.</p><p>We now give a flavour of how we tackled each psychological factor across the 12 videos: <italic toggle="yes">affective engagement:</italic> footage of the dramatic impacts of the climate crisis on people's health and living condition (e.g. communities devastated by floods); <italic toggle="yes">collective efficacy</italic>: footage of collective climate action such as the Sunrise movement campaigns that achieved a shift in political priorities; <italic toggle="yes">social norms</italic>: interviews with professors and peer-student activists talking about their experiences, bonds and mentorship within their activist community; <italic toggle="yes">faith in institutions</italic>: a combination of the history of unproductive international and national climate policy initiatives, combined with examples of current politicians that have an earnest climate crisis focus; <italic toggle="yes">self-identity</italic>: scenes that would engage, for example, self-identified naturalists and social justice advocates; <italic toggle="yes">self-efficacy and attitudes</italic>: testimonies of other students devoting themselves to making change; <italic toggle="yes">theory of change</italic>: interviews of activists and academics analysing the history of social movements and the feasibility of local climate activism in driving policy change; and <italic toggle="yes">imagination</italic>: hypothetical scenarios of a future world following a transition away from fossil fuels.

They were asked to avoid distractions and to put away their devices. The video software dictated the pace of viewing (i.e. they could not advance beyond the video without the total time of the video having passed).

Again, at the top of the bulletin, participants were reminded that they were not penalized for not attending these events. They were then asked seven attention-check questions, five covering the video and two covering the event bulletin. Responding incorrectly to three or more questions resulted in a $3 penalty for that overall video session ($3 were subtracted from the final payment of $100), and the participants were redirected to watch the video again and to re-take the final test to avoid losing the $3 (they only had two attempts).</p></sec><sec id="s2a8"><label>2.1.8.<x xml:space="preserve"> </x></label><title>Follow-up survey</title><p>After the 12-week intervention, participants completed a follow-up survey very similar to the baseline survey but without demographics (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">e</italic>).</p><sec id="s2a8a"><label>2.1.8.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Activism behaviours</title><p>We embedded a study team member in the partner organizations.

This was initially planned to gain a more nuanced understanding of how participants experienced the psychological factors that emerged as the best predictors of activism behaviour. Due to the lack of activism behaviour, these interviews were used to understand what held back the participants from engaging in the online events. The semi-structured interviews also explored participants' subjective beliefs about what caused any increase in the psychological factors from pre- to post-intervention. With these general aims in mind, and learning from each participant's quantitative results, we tailored an interview script. Possible questions could relate to changes or lack of change from baseline to follow-up, as well as the lack of engagement in climate action.

We therefore maintained neutral expectations for how this factor may change and how this variation could affect participation.

For objective attendance of activism events, only two participants joined during the intervention (one participant joined five events, and the other participant joined one event); self-reported environmental education and leadership had no change (&#x02212;0.02 out of 7), and self-reported emissions reduction also had no change (+0.01 out of 7, all <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>s (95) &#x0003c; 1.00, all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.99 all <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>s &#x0003c; 0.10).</p><sec id="s2b1"><label>2.2.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Final interviews</title><p>Forty participants agreed to be interviewed at the end of the study.

As personal reasons were usually merged with speculations about other people's reasons, both these answers are compiled together in <xref rid="RSOS210006TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. The most common obstacles were (1) Zoom fatigue, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic (during this study, students had been attending classes on Zoom for over a year); (2) perception of a lack of opportunities to socialize normally given the climate events were only on Zoom; (3) school workload and (4) being too busy due to other responsibilities such as a job or community organizing.

After the six-week video intervention, three psychological factors increased: affective engagement, collective efficacy, and self-efficacy. Exit interviews of 40 participants suggested that the main trigger of these changes was the video content, in particular the information about extreme weather events, health impacts and collective and individual activism.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, only two participants joined the activist events (all of which were online given the COVID-19 pandemic). After five months, one participant had become a sustained activist in a local organization. The interviews suggested that poor participation was overwhelmingly due to Zoom fatigue and the participants' perception that the Zoom format precluded typical social interactions. This opened the question of whether the intervention was weak due to this lack of social interaction or to the absence of change in the other eight psychological factors. Therefore, after the Registered Report Stage 1 In-Principle Acceptance and with the editor's permission, we ran an exploratory follow-up study with an in-person intervention where participants watched the videos in a social setting and could participate in on-campus activism events.</p><sec id="s3a"><label>3.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Unregistered pilot study 2</title><p>This was an in-person, six-week replication of Study 1 and did not include a baseline.

This small sample (smaller than the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> prescribed by our power analysis for Study 1) seemed appropriate for a small pilot study with no planned comparison between two groups (experimental and baseline). 38 completed the full study (a 42% dropout rate). Recruitment was carried out as in Study 1, but this time the final reward amount was $150 per person to facilitate recruitment under pandemic conditions.</p><p>As in Study 1, participants first underwent a screening survey to exclude those not believing in anthropogenic global heating and those who attended more than one climate activism event prior to the study (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Those passing the screening signed a consent form agreeing to complete online surveys and to attend a 1.5 h in-person event every week for six weeks. Everyone first completed a baseline survey measuring the same 11 psychological factors and self-reported climate-related behaviors as Study 1. Then, every Monday night, participants gathered in a classroom at UC San Diego. Here, a study member coordinated an ice-breaking activity: solving riddles in groups of three or four. Then, she showed two 25-min videos (the same videos from Study 1), after which the participants took a four-question comprehension quiz on their mobile phone. They were prompted to respond to the last two questions of the quiz collectively in groups of three to four to engage each other in a conversation about the video content. After this, an activist guest from the climate org UCSD Green New Deal came into the room and described a bulletin of events for her organization for the following five days. A comprehension quiz followed with participants responding to the last two questions in groups. If participants did not show up at the Monday session or did not complete any of the comprehension quizzes, they incurred a $20 penalty. At the activism events, a confederate tracked attendance by having all attendees fill in a sign-up sheet. At the end of the six weeks, participants again completed the survey measuring the 11 psychological factors and self-reported behaviors. There was a group debrief activity during the last in-person session.</p><p>We hypothesized that the in-person intervention would increase some of the 11 psychological factors and attendance of activist events.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><label>3.1.2<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Results</title><p>Two psychological factors increased after the intervention (after Bonferroni-Holm correction): self-efficacy <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>37</sub> = 3.62, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.01, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.33 and identity <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>37</sub> = 3.60, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.59.

However, only two participants (5%) each joined a single event. This small study suggests that including a social component, in-person study events, and activist events is not sufficient to trigger attendance at activist events, at least with this study design in this population and during the late-2021 pandemic.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><label>4<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>General discussion</title><p>Three psychological factors were boosted by the Study 1 intervention (self-efficacy, collective efficacy and affective engagement) and only two of 96 participants attended activist events (2%). The main reasons they gave for not attending were Zoom fatigue and a perceived lack of social interaction at online events. The in-person intervention in Study 2 increased two factors: self-efficacy (like in Study 1) and identity, and only two out of 38 participants attended an activist event (5%).</p><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Change in psychological factors</title><p>Across both studies, the video intervention boosted self-efficacy, such that participants felt empowered and more aware that their skills could contribute to climate activism. The intervention also boosted affective engagement, collective efficacy (Study 1), and identity (Study 2). Only four of the 11 factors changed in either study, suggesting that changes this size in these four factors alone were not sufficient to trigger action. Re-designing the videos might help to boost all 11 factors. Future research could employ a professional videographer, create content that is more local to the participants and use forms of narrative structure, perhaps by involving actors. Or, additional factors might need to be discovered and targeted. It remains possible that large increases in the 11 factors might not be sufficient to trigger action when participants do not have the time or financial resources to volunteer for activism.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><label>4.2<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Recruitment incentives</title><p>When advertising the studies (with a reward of $100 for Study 1 and $150 for Study 2) we hid the climate crisis content to attract a neutral (and generalizable) student audience rather than a self-selecting audience already interested in climate action. For Study 2 the payment was increased to $150 because few students were signing up, probably due to pandemic conditions. The informal debriefing for Study 2 strongly indicated that participants were short of money and time and expected payment to join the activist events.</p><p>In our assessment, the central reason why our two studies were not effective in driving more people to participate in climate activism was that they were participating mostly for payment. This reflects the socioeconomic status and material realities of a segment of the UC San Diego undergraduate population, many of whom both attend school and work jobs. Students did appear to care about the climate, but they appeared not to have the time and resources to enter these particular activist spaces. This observation leads to the fundamental question of how to overcome the near-universal barriers of time and financial resources to engage in activism.</p><p>One potential incentive to join action for those lacking time or financial resources could be the support system that is often created inside an activist group&#x02014;something our study did not encourage. Our personal observations point to emotional and social benefits of participation. For example, when activists share values and struggles inside the activist space, they become empathetic with each other and can learn solidarity skills of mutual aid and support to overcome engagement obstacles. For example, they can cover each other's work shifts to allow one to go to a rally or help each other find jobs within activism or advocacy. These connections with other activists also lead to valuable professional networks. Accordingly, interventions might trigger more engagement by advertising these benefits or designing the intervention to foster these exchanges. We also recommend providing more event times that fit busy schedules, and specifically recruiting participants already interested or engaged in climate activism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5<x xml:space="preserve">. </x></label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The intensive video intervention increased several psychological factors associated with collective action on climate, but only a few participants attended activist events. The main weakness in this design may have been the reliance on paid study participation: we appear to have inadvertently selected some of the financially challenged students in our community who had little time and resources for volunteer activities. The study design could be strengthened in multiple ways from better video-making to creating different participation opportunities.</p><p>The central question of this study remains highly relevant: how can people be moved to collective action to protect our climate during a climate collapse? This study sheds light on how difficult it is to trigger this behaviour, which is even more reason for psychology studies using longitudinal designs and objective measurements of key behaviors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="rsos210006_review_history.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Debra Lindsay for helping us identify the rating scales to measure the 11 factors of interest, and for her technical support building some of the surveys.</p></ack><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics</title><p>Our procedures were approved by the University of California, San Diego, Human Research Protections Programme, with project no.
