An uncomfortable, unsettling truth of climate change and global pandemic is that the loss of people, places, practices, and so many others is somewhat unavoidable. Whilst the policy to prevent loss is no doubt needed, embracing&#8212;rather than denying&#8212;the possibility of loss may perhaps help people better overcome or come to terms with grief and loss. A science of loss is to understand what kind of loss would be intolerable to people, how a loss might arise through changes in the natural environment and, when the loss is unavoidable, help people to manage grief and remember loss (Barnett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>). Importantly, as Barnett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>) said, many phenomena that people value are often <italic>incommensurable</italic> with no possible substitutes; hence, there can be no effective compensation for their loss. As the New York Times wrote in an obituary of a hundred thousand lives lost to coronavirus, it is an &#8220;incalculable loss&#8221;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> To condole with the people in grief can be the role of science. This means that the research has to go further into an <italic>emotional</italic> engagement with stakeholders, more than just that for producing knowledge, at which is often aimed in transdisciplinary sustainability research (Lang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>).</p>
