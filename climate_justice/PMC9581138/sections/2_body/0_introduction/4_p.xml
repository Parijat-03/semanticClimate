<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">While several studies have attempted to map citizen science (e.g., Roy et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kullenberg and Kasperowski, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hecker et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), these are few and far between. Furthermore, despite the vast work that is currently taking place within CS projects and activities, there is still a lack of knowledge about the impact of these projects and activities on society and how to integrate CS into new policies. More information is needed about citizen engagement, appropriate research methodologies, and the contribution of CS to policy-making.</p>
