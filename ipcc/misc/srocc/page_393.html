Before the advent of modern sources of nutrients, it was imperative for farmers to maintain and improve soil fertility through the prevention of runoff and erosion, and management of nutrients through vegetation residues and manure. Many ancient farming systems were sustainable for hundreds and even thousands of years, such as raised-&#64257;eld agriculture in Mexico (Crews and Gliessman 1991), tropical forest gardens in Southeast Asia and Central America (Ross 2011; Torquebiau 1992; Turner and Sabloff 2012), terraced agriculture in East Africa, Central America, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean basin (Turner and Sabloff 2012; Preti and Romano 2014; Widgren and Sutton 2004; H&#229;kansson and Widgren 2007; Davies and Moore 2016; Davies 2015), and integrated rice&#8211;&#64257;sh cultivation in East Asia (Frei and Becker 2005). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="387.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 387.55; y1: 397.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="387.55" x1="312.98">Such long-term sustainable farming systems evolved in very different times and geographical contexts, but they share many common features, such as: the combination of species and structural diversity in time and space (horizontally and vertically) in order to optimise the use of available land; recycling of nutrients through biodiversity of plants, animals and microbes; harnessing the full range of site-speci&#64257;c micro-environments (e.g.,&#160;wet and dry soils); biological interdependencies which help suppression of pests; reliance on mainly local resources; reliance on local varieties of crops, and sometimes incorporation of wild plants and animals; the systems are often labour and knowledge intensive (Rudel et al. 2016; Beets 1990; Netting 1993; Altieri and Koohafkan 2008). Such farming systems have stood the test of time and can provide important knowledge for adapting farming systems to climate change (Koohafkann and Altieri 2011). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.97" top="195.57"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 195.57; y1: 205.07; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="195.57" x1="312.97">In modern agriculture, the importance of maintaining the biological productivity and ecological integrity of farmland has not been a&#160;necessity in the same way as in pre-modern agriculture because nutrients and water have been supplied externally. The extreme land degradation in the US Midwest during the Dust Bowl period in the 1930s became an important wake-up call for agriculture and agricultural research and development, from which we can still learn much in order to adapt to ongoing and future climate change (McLeman et al. 2014; Baveye et al. 2011; McLeman and Smit 2006). </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.96" top="75.59"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 75.59; y1: 85.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="75.59" x1="312.96">SLM is a&#160;unifying framework for addressing land degradation and can be de&#64257;ned as the stewardship and use of land resources, including </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.48" top="735.59"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 326.95; y0: 735.59; y1: 745.09; width: 3.51; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.59" x1="571.48">soils, water, animals and plants, to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions. It is a&#160;comprehensive approach comprising technologies combined with social, economic and political enabling conditions (Nkonya et al. 2011). It is important to stress that farming systems are informed by both scienti&#64257;c and local/traditional knowledge. The power of SLM in small-scale diverse farming was demonstrated effectively in Nicaragua after the severe cyclone Mitch in 1998 (Holt-Gim&#233;nez 2002). Pairwise analysis of 880 &#64257;elds with and without implementation of SLM practices showed that the SLM &#64257;elds systematically fared better than the &#64257;elds without SLM in terms of more topsoil remaining, higher &#64257;eld moisture, more vegetation, less erosion and lower economic losses after the cyclone. Furthermore, the difference between &#64257;elds with and without SLM increased with increasing levels of storm intensity, slope gradient, and age of SLM (Holt-Gim&#233;nez 2002). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.45" top="519.62"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 331.0; y0: 519.62; y1: 529.12; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="519.62" x1="571.45">When addressing land degradation through SLM and other approaches, it is important to consider feedbacks that impact on climate change.

In the context of adaptation to climate change, actions relevant for addressing land degradation are sometimes framed as ecosystem-based adaptation (Scarano 2017) or Nature-Based Solutions (Nessh&#246;ver et al. 2017), and in an agricultural context, agroecology (see Glossary) provides an important frame. The site-speci&#64257;c biophysical and social conditions, including local and indigenous knowledge, are important for successful implementation of concrete actions. </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.51" top="267.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 328.36; y0: 267.54; y1: 277.04; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="267.54" x1="571.51">Responses to land degradation generally take the form of agronomic measures (methods related to managing the vegetation cover), soil management (methods related to tillage, nutrient supply), and mechanical methods (methods resulting in durable changes to the landscape) (Morgan 2005a). Measures may be combined to reinforce bene&#64257;ts to land quality, as well as improving carbon sequestration that supports climate change mitigation. Some measures offer adaptation options and other co-bene&#64257;ts, such as agroforestry, involving planting fruit trees that can support food security in the face of climate change impacts (Reed and Stringer 2016), or application of compost or biochar that enhances soil water-holding capacity, so increases resilience to drought.</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.45" top="111.56"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 111.56; y1: 121.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="111.56" x1="571.45">There are important differences in terms of labour and capital requirements for different technologies, and also implications for land tenure arrangements.
