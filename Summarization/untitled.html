They focus on the importance of reaching "net zero" CO2 emission goals and how best to do so within the context of the Paris Climate Treaty. They also discuss the economic costs and potential benefits of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in order to realize the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). They present several different kinds of mitigation pathway analysis and discuss the methodologies used to evaluate them. They conclude with a discussion of the knowledge gaps and methods for assessment and answering frequently asked questions. This chapter is organized into five main sections: Section 1.1. discusses the scientific literature that has been used to date to address such issues; section 2.2 provides a detailed overview of the different approaches used in the IPCC's WG III AR6 report; section 3.0 covers the types of specific mitigation pathways discussed in previous IPCC Reports; section 4.5 explores the implication of these pathways for future climate goals; section 5.6 examines the economic consequences of avoiding a runaway warming scenario; section 7.8 introduces a concept framing for conceptualizing alternative pathways; and finally, they discuss the methods of assessment and evaluation for assessing the feasibility of each pathway.
