<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The World Health Organization&#8217;s vision for primary health care raises broader questions on responsive, efficient and cost-effective service delivery as well as equitable outcomes. Shifting disease patterns and the other effects of climate change disproportionately affect low-income countries and vulnerable populations, as well as small island states, many of which contribute least to global carbon emissions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The inequities fuelled by the climate crisis and its associated environmental consequences have dire public health consequences, especially for poor people, older adults, children, racial and ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups. Additionally, the climate crisis threatens to exacerbate migration as well as gender-based health disparities:<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> large-scale migration will increase because of resource scarcity and extreme weather events, and women face higher risks and greater burdens from climate change. Primary health care must be purposefully adapted to counter these worsening and unequally distributed problems. Moreover, high-income countries must do more to reduce their share of carbon pollution and help stem the worst effects of climate change. More positively, primary health care adaptation and improvement offer opportunities to both improve population health and well-being, and to empower populations to catalyse positive changes to both health and the climate crisis.</p>
