By asking questions that focus on the personal and the professional, listeners gain insight into the inequalities and injustices that guests have faced. Listeners also get to hear about the aspirations and successes of the guest speakers and how they have overcome challenges. The hope from implementing inclusive practices is also that guests can serve as examples for environmental organizations to prioritize and implement diversity and inclusion.</p>
