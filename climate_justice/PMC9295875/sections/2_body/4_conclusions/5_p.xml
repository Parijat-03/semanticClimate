The pandemic situation is an unexpected phenomenon in the atmospheric variations. For example, the fuzzy set theory has the flexible manipulation of the membership function, a main type of theory. So, the interested variables could be weighted easily. Otherwise, the neural networking could be used for the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze the weather and its related effects such as fatal viruses, because the expectation ability of a certain situation is higher in the AI contained in the robotics. The combination of technical approaches of complex logic and social-humanity treats could enhance finding the solution to climate troubles and this leads to taking the climate justice for increasing the human welfare.</p>
