<bold>Tessa:</bold> International diplomacy routinely squeezes out calls for climate justice because processes like the UN climate talks are simply more accessible if you're a rich country or constituency or interest group. The complexity of the climate talks, which have dozens of different workstreams that are often being negotiated simultaneously, means that those countries that can afford to send large diplomatic contingents for weeks at a time are more likely to be able to influence the outcomes of those negotiations. Further, civil society groups and movements calling for climate justice &#8211; which are overwhelmingly from the Global South &#8211; are stopped from effectively voicing their demands in the talks because of the literal and metaphorical cost of entry to the negotiations, including travel costs, the registration process and crackdowns on peaceful protest.<xref rid="newe12203-note-0008" ref-type="fn">
