<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The reality of climate change, however, creates an urgent need to revise the narrow disease-specific definition of an international public health emergency. For example, the term &#8220;event&#8221; implies a discrete and timebound threat whereas the imminent health threats posed by climate change are protracted, chronic conditions. We therefore support a recent call for WHO to convene &#8220;review conferences&#8221; of its health regulations to consider how best to tackle health emergencies related to climate change.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In relation to the covid-19 outbreak, one commentator suggested that the regulations&#8217; &#8220;all-or-nothing approach&#8221; towards declaring an international health emergency should include a spectrum of alerts from category 1 to category 5.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We argue that such flexibility should extend to include threats to global public health that are not disease specific.</p>
