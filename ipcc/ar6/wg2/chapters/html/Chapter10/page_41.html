However, challenges specific (though not exclusive) to Asian cities such as uneven economic development, rapid land-use changes, increasing inequality, growing exposure to extreme events and environmental change, such as land subsidence (with antecedent impacts on people and infrastructure), and large, socially differentiated vulnerable populations, remain key concerns as Asian cities simultaneously tackle challenges of sustainable development and equitable climate action.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="176.75" top="186.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="186.48" x1="176.75" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 186.48; y1: 196.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.6.1 Sub-regional Diversity</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.82" top="162.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="162.6" x1="307.82" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.07; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">By 2050, urban areas are expected to add 2.5&#160;billion people, 90% of whom will be in Asia and Africa (UNDESA, 2018). Critically, this urban population increase will be concentrated in India, China and Nigeria, with India and China adding 416&#160;million and 255&#160;million urban dwellers, respectively, between 2018 and 2050 (UNDESA, 2018).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="571.42" top="64.44"><span x0="54.14" y0="64.44" x1="571.42" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 57.51; y0: 64.44; y1: 71.44; width: 3.37; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: BGTYRB+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">4 Average annual loss is the average amount that a country could expect to lose each year over the long term due to hazard incidence. It corresponds to the expected average loss per year considering all the events that could occur over a long time frame, including very intensive events. It is a probabilistic indication of the direct economic losses expected due to total or partial damage of physical assets existing in the affected area (UNISDR, 2017).</span></div><div left="318.33" right="572.0" top="714.6"><span x0="318.33" y0="714.6" x1="572.0" style="x0: 318.33; x1: 322.91; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">of Asia&#8217;s 3.3&#160;billion people will be living in cities. Asia is also home to the world&#8217;s largest urban agglomerations: Tokyo (37&#160;million inhabitants), New Delhi (29&#160;million) and Shanghai (26&#160;million) are the top three with Cairo, Mumbai, Beijing and Dhaka home to nearly 20&#160;million people each (UNDESA, 2018). By 2028, New Delhi is projected to become the most populous city in the world. In certain parts of Asia (e.g., some cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea), a steep decline in urban population is projected, mainly due to declining birth rates (Hori et&#160;al., 2020). Within Asia, rates of urban  isation differ sub-regionally. Eastern Asia has seen the most rapid urban growth with the percentage of urban population having more than tripled from 18 to 60% between 1950 and 2015, while rates of urbanisation have decreased in West Asia and remained steady in Central Asia (UNDESA, 2018).</span></div><div left="318.33" right="572.08" top="546.62"><span x0="318.33" y0="546.62" x1="572.08" style="x0: 318.33; x1: 323.78; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Asian cities are seeing growing income inequality, with rural poverty being replaced by urban poverty (ADB, 2013). Regional studies show high and growing inequality within Indian and Chinese urban areas and decreasing rural&#8211;urban income gaps in Thailand and Vietnam (Baker and Gadgil, 2017; Imai and Malaeb, 2018). Critically, East Asia and the Asia&#8211;Pacific in general continue to house the world&#8217;s largest population of slum dwellers at 250&#160;million, with most of them in China, Indonesia and the Philippines, and the highest rates of urban poverty in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Indonesia and the Lao PDR (McIlreavy, 2015; Baker and Gadgil, 2017). A lot of urbanisation, especially in South Asia, is also &#8216;hidden&#8217; due to poor, competing definitions of what is &#8216;urban&#8217; and limited data (Ellis and Roberts, 2016).</span></div><div left="318.33" right="465.56" top="390.48"><span x0="318.33" y0="390.48" x1="465.56" style="x0: 318.33; x1: 323.13; y0: 390.48; y1: 400.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.6.2 Key Drivers of Vulnerabilities</span></div><div left="318.33" right="572.02" top="366.6"><span x0="318.33" y0="366.6" x1="572.02" style="x0: 318.33; x1: 320.63; y0: 366.6; y1: 376.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In Asian cities, climatic hazards such as changes in precipitation and, during the Asian monsoon, SLR, cyclones, flooding, dust storms, heatwaves and permafrost thawing (Byers et&#160;al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et&#160;al., 2018; Rogelj et&#160;al., 2018; Shiklomanov, 2019), as well as non-climatic vulnerabilities such as non-climatic hazards (e.g., seismic hazards), inadequate infrastructure and services, unplanned urbanisation, socioeconomic inequalities and existing adaptation deficits (Johnson et&#160;al., 2013; Araos et&#160;al., 2016; de Leon and Pittock, 2017; Meerow, 2017; Dulal, 2019) interact to shape overall urban risk (Shaw et&#160;al., 2016a; Rumbach and Shirgaokar, 2017; Dodman et&#160;al., 2019).
