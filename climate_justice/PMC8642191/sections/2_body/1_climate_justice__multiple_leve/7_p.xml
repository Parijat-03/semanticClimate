As this article is focused on the financial policies and measures of China and the EU, two jurisdictions which are not just parties to the Paris Agreement but which were major protagonists in its negotiation, it is submitted that contribution to the Article 2.1c goal of the Agreement is an appropriate yardstick with which to assess &#8216;green&#8217; or &#8216;sustainable&#8217; finance measures. This goal identifies the necessary outcome of financial transition in the context of climate transition, as agreed by parties. The inclusion of this text in the provision on treaty aims had the effect of embedding financial transition in the teleology of the Paris Agreement, a treaty with near-universal membership which addresses both international cooperation and national obligations. Article 2.1c should therefore be seen as the clearest normative statement in international law of the financial transformation required in order to address climate change. Crucially, this goal is universal, unqualified and undifferentiated, such that all parties to the Paris Agreement must work towards it. Just as any financing can contribute to harmful or helpful activities from the perspective of climate mitigation and adaptation, financial frameworks can be assessed according to whether or not they contribute to the redirection of &#8216;financial flows&#8217; as required by the Paris Agreement.</p>
