Surely, previously mentioned groups like Deep Adaptation are taking forward ideas that overlap with notions of transformational adaptation, yet its implications for the wider climate movement remain questionable. Potentially reflecting earlier findings suggesting that climate movement leaders often struggle to advance progressive notions of adaptation (de Moor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>), adaptation seems to remain seen as, and associated with, conservative politics in the eyes of the climate movement&#8217;s rank and file. As Zografos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) have recently noted, transformational adaptation, while attracting increasing academic attention, has not made the leap to actual politics. Boda and Jerneck warn that &#8216;calls for major structural transformations remain vague without identifying what viable agent and through which particular processes such changes can be accomplished&#8217; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>, 633). Transformational adaptation may be a desirable outcome of politicizing and democratizing adaptation, and the latter may present a necessary condition for the former, but more research is still needed to understand which actors may actually contribute to the realization of transformational adaptation and how (Carmin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>).</p>
