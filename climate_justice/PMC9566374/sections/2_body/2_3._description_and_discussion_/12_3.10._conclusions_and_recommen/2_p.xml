<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate change already affects many public health functions. This conceptual framework provides a useful contribution to analyse and monitor the effects of climate change on health and health inequalities as well as to guide the design and assessment of policies and interventions to reduce these effects and GHG emissions. The framework reveals the complexity and importance of combatting climate change and its effects on health, highlighting specific particularities of cities with Mediterranean climates. The involvement of multiple sectors, as well as the need for structural changes in models requires intersectoral and multi-level action which, more than ever, requires a health perspective on all policies to improve health equity. Climate change is a complex phenomenon, but the irrefutable scientific evidence, and the already noticeable effects of the current climate crisis, call for strengthening and accelerating the climate strategy both locally and globally.</p>
