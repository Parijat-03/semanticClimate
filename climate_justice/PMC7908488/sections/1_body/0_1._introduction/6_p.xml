<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Literature on thermal inequities is beginning to emerge, although studies are often general or limited to specific case studies. Mitchell and Chakraborty [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used the term to describe the unequal distribution of the urban heat island impacts amongst populations in Florida. Wong et al. [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found thermal inequities in age, marital status, occupation, education attainment, and income throughout Hong Kong. Furthermore, Harlan et al. [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found older, low-income, and minority populations in Phoenix to be disproportionately impacted by increases in urban temperatures. In a study of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, Mitchell et al. [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found higher temperatures in census tracts to be associated with Black, Hispanic, disabled, non-English-speaking, and low-income populations. Mitchell and Chakraborty [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provided an expanded analysis of 20 cities throughout the U.S. and found census tracts with higher socioeconomic status to be associated with greater heat exposure. However, they found an inconsistent association between minority neighborhoods and greater heat. In a study of Phoenix, Jenerette et al. [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found that increases in median income of $10,000 were associated with a decrease of 0.28 &#176;C in neighborhood temperature. In a study of Santiago, Chile, De La Barrera et al. [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found low-income neighborhoods to have temperatures 2.5&#8211;3.3 &#176;C higher than in high-income districts.</p>
