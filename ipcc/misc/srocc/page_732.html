Traditional systems include: traditional silvopastoral management (Iran), management of rangeland resources (South Africa), natural resource management (Ethiopia, Tanzania, Bangladesh) communal grazing land management (Ethiopia) and management of con&#64258;ict over natural resources (Siddig et al. 2007; Yami et al. 2011; Valipour et al. 2014; Bennett 2013; Mowo et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="567.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.1; y0: 567.56; y1: 577.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="567.56" x1="566.09">Formal&#8211;informal institutional interaction could take different shapes such as: complementary, accommodating, competing, and substitutive. There are many examples when formal institutions might obstruct, change, and hinder informal institutions (Rahman et al. 2014; Helmke and Levitsky 2004; Bennett 2013; Osei-Tutu et al. 2014). Similarly, informal institutions can replace, undermine, and reinforce formal institutions (Grzymala-Busse 2010). In the absence of formal institutions, informal institutions gain importance, requiring focus in relation to natural resources management and rights protection (Estrin and Prevezer 2011; Helmke and Levitsky 2004; Kangalawe et al. 2014; Sauerwald and Peng 2013; Zoogah et&#160;al. 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="423.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 423.58; y1: 433.08; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="423.58" x1="566.09">Community forestry comprises 22% of forests in tropical countries in contrast to large-scale industrial forestry (Hajjar et al. 2013) and is managed with informal institutions, ensuring a sustainable &#64258;ow of forest products and income, utilising traditional ecological knowledge to determine access to resources (Singh et al. 2018). Policies that create an open platform for local debates and allow actors their own active formulation of rules strengthen informal institutions. Case studies in Zambia, Mali, Indonesia and Bolivia con&#64257;rm that enabling factors for advancing the local ownership of resources and crafting durability of informal rules require recognition in laws, regulations and policies of the state (Haller et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="551.98" top="267.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 267.42; y1: 277.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="267.42" x1="551.98">7.5.2 Decision-making, timing, risk, and uncertainty </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="243.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 243.52; y1: 253.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="243.52" x1="566.08">This section assesses decision-making literature, concluding that advances in methods have been made in the face of conceptual risk literature and, together with a synthesis of empirical evidence, near-term decisions have signi&#64257;cant impact on costs.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="432.34" top="183.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 183.42; y1: 193.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="183.42" x1="432.34">7.5.2.1 Problem structuring</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="159.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 159.52; y1: 169.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="159.52" x1="566.1">Structured decision-making occurs when there is scienti&#64257;c knowledge about cause and effect, little uncertainty, and agreement exists on values and norms relating to an issue (Hurlbert and Gupta 2016).
