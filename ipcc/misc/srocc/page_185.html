There is, however, evidence that the seasonal magnitude and sign of those effects at the regional level are strongly related to soil-moisture/evapotranspiration and snow regimes, particularly in temperate and boreal latitudes (Teuling et&#160;al. 2010; Pitman and de Noblet-Ducoudr&#233; 2012; Alkama and Cescatti 2016). Quesada et&#160;al. (2017a) showed that atmospheric circulation changes can be signi&#64257; cantly strengthened in winter for tropical and temperate regions. However, the lack of studies underlines the need for a more systematic assessment of seasonal, regional and other- than-mean-temperature metrics in the future.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="571.6" top="273.3"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.9; y0: 273.3; y1: 281.3; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="273.3" x1="571.6">Figur  e 2.14 |  Changes in mean global annual surface air temperature (&#176;C) in response to historical and future anthropogenic land cover changes as estimated from a range of studies. </span><span style="x0: 186.47; x1: 189.88; y0: 263.75; y1: 271.75; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="186.47" y0="263.75" x1="571.36">See Table A2.1 in the Appendix for detailed information.
