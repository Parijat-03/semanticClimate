Recognizing a social need to confront stereotypes and generate awareness about reproductive rights and sexual practices, the exhibit recreates a playful environment&#8212;a party&#8212;with a labyrinth of choices, courses of actions, and outcomes (see Navas Iannini &amp; Pedretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>). Teenagers are invited to engage in the party, dance, enjoy, laugh, dramatize, and make &#8220;tough&#8221; decisions about issues that could actually confront them (such as having sex, choosing contraceptive options, getting pregnant, considering abortion, fearing a sexually transmitted disease). At the end of the party, with the support of a sexual educator, visitors share their impressions, feelings, decisions, doubts, and concerns.</p>
