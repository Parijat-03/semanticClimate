Pathways analysis focuses on consumption and behavioural changes through\ntransitions and transformative solutions (IPBES 2018a). Pathways analysis is highly relevant in support of policy, since it outlines\nsets of time-dependent actions and decisions to achieve future targets, especially with respect to sustainable development goals,\nas well as highlighting trade-offs and co-benefits (IPBES 2018a). Multiple, alternative pathways have been shown to exist that\nmitigate trade-offs whilst achieving the priorities for future sustainable development outlined by governments and societal actors. Of\nthese alternatives, the most promising focus on long-term societal transformations through education, awareness raising, knowledge\nsharing and participatory decision-making (IPBES 2018a).</td>

      <td>but a &#8216;climate-centric&#8217; perspective can limit the capacity of these scenarios to account for a wider range of land-relevant drivers (Rosa\net al. 2017). For example, in climate mitigation scenarios it is important to assess the impact of mitigation actions on the broader\nenvironment such as biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, food security, desertification/degradation and water cycles (Rosa\net al. 2017). This implies the need for a more encompassing and flexible approach to creating scenarios that considers other environmental\naspects, not only as a part of impact assessment, but also during the process of creating the scenarios themselves.\nA limited number of models can quantify global scale, land-use change scenarios, and there is large variance in the outcomes of these\nmodels (Alexander et al. 2016a; Prestele et al. 2016). In some cases, there is greater variability between the models themselves than\nbetween the scenarios that they are quantifying, and these differences vary geographically (Prestele et al. 2016). These differences\narise from variations in baseline datasets, thematic classes and modelling paradigms (Alexander et al. 2016a; Popp et al. 2016; Prestele\net al. 2016). Model evaluation is critical in establishing confidence in the outcomes of modelled futures (Ahlstrom et al. 2012; Kelley\net al. 2013). Some, but not all, land-use models are evaluated against observational data and model evaluation is rarely reported.\nHence, there is a need for more transparency in land-use modelling, especially in evaluation and testing, as well as making model code\navailable with complete sets of scenario outputs (e.g., Dietrich et al. 2018).</td>
