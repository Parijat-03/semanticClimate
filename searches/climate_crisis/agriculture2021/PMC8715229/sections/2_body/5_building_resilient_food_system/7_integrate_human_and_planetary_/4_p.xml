<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0435">To enable dietary shifts, there needs to be greater emphasis on affordability. Healthy and sustainable diets should not be a luxury. Before the pandemic an estimated 3 billion people were unable to afford a healthy diet on a consistent basis (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2020a</xref>). Environmental, health, and social costs are largely not reflected in most common food product prices, whereas organic, healthy food, produced in a socially responsible way is often expensive. The contraction of economies and the decline in disposable incomes during the pandemic threaten to put healthy diets further out of the reach of large parts of the global population. Awareness-building campaigns, policies and regulations, and better food labeling need to be accompanied by a greater emphasis on affordability. Governments should take into account the health, social, and environmental burden passed on to society, by identifying, testing, and implementing suitable incentive mechanisms that transfer some of the cost of healthy diets to unsustainable food products.</p>
