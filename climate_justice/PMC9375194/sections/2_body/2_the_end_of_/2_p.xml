On the one hand, Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden of Eden for their sinful actions, but on the other hand, they go forth into the world and make a &#8220;garden&#8221; of their own, with explicit instructions to &#8220;till the soil&#8221; and &#8220;eat the plants of the field&#8221; (Genesis 3:18, 23). By the time the book of Genesis was written, humans were well along in tilling fields and gardens, which was a fulfillment of the biblical mandate to &#8220;have dominion.&#8221; But it would only be a <italic>partial</italic> fulfillment of the mandate until, along with having dominion over the flora, humans also found ways to rule over the fauna, to &#8220;have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth&#8221; (Genesis 1:26 RSV). To state the obvious, having dominion &#8220;over all the earth&#8221; is a tall order for any species, even for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, not that this keeps us from trying. Human beings, after all, are &#8220;special&#8221; in the created order, if we take the Genesis account literally, set apart from and elevated above every other living thing. The agricultural revolution set in motion a chain of events that millennia later culminated in the religious view of human exceptionalism, or the &#8220;belief in human distinctiveness&#8221; (Harari, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>, p. 78). Notwithstanding the sinful actions of our early ancestors, we are, according to Genesis, a unique creation, God&#8217;s defining and crowning achievement.</p>
