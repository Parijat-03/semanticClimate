Barring cases of pregnancies and births resulting from coercion, the lack of the necessary mental capacities for minimal agency, or the lack of the material means to prevent pregnancies, it is argued that procreators make a choice to try to procreate, or make a choice to engage in sexual intercourse without taking the necessary measures to avoid (or terminate) a pregnancy. The dominant view among resource egalitarians is that if certain minimal conditions of agency and voluntariness are met, procreators can be held responsible for the procreation, in the sense that they are the ones who should bear the costs of procreative acts and their consequences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref></p>
