MDBs have established capacity for the analytical and fiduciary preparations necessary to reduce risks and increase potential effectiveness of investments in adaptation (Murphy &amp; Parry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). However using this channel can also generate barriers in the form of administrative requirements of the MDBs. (Brunner &amp; Enting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). One of the most important of these barriers is the restricted set of first beneficiaries that MDBs can channel funds to. This is often restricted to national governments, eliminating the possibility of channelling funds through NGOs or even national development banks. This limitation can also create problems in developing blended finance with the private sector as highlighted in the example in the previous section.</p>
