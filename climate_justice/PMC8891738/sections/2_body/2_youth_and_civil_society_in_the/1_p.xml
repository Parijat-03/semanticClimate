Almost 400 young people from 186 countries worked on the &#8216;Youth4Climate Manifesto&#8217; delivered to the COP26 Presidency. It was a vital point; these young women and men working together across national interests. My personal experience working with this constituency underlines this point. I had the privilege to work alongside young women and men, mostly volunteers whilst organizing the Youth for Vienna Energy Forum (VEF). It was the first time for the VEF and for UNIDO to host an event designed by and for youth, in which the civil society could express their needs and directly engage with high-level speakers. The level of interaction, passion, and knowledge at this event suggested that young people are hungry for concrete actions and a meaningful seat at the table. I also had a feeling that these young people are committed to fighting for climate justice. It was therefore not a surprise that this time around, youth and public empowerment got their own &#8216;day&#8217; (5th November) at COP26.</p>
