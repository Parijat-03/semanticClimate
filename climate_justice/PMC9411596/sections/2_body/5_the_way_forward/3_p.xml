This is critical to enabling the integration of CRAs and realising the required scope. The purpose of common principles is not only to facilitate transparency but to ensure the inclusion of users&#8217; needs, expertise and capabilities. Research bodies, regulators, and the private sector all have a role to play in the development of common principles. Existing initiatives like the World Climate Research Programme Lighthouse Activities, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and US Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules for climate-related disclosures should be linked and bottom-up connections across multiple organisations and stakeholders should be facilitated and supported.</p>
