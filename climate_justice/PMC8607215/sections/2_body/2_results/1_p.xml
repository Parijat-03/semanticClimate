Relatedly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected with high confidence that by 2050, global temperature will increase from 1.8 to 4.0&#160;&#176;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This pattern is expected to worsen in light of the country&#8217;s emissions trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. By emitting around 464 million metric tons (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e) of GHGs, it is ranked the highest emitter at the continental level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a consequence, (inter)national mean temperature will continue to rise above 4&#160;&#176;C over the twenty-first century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The period implies that generation is an important determinant of one&#8217;s susceptibility to the impact of harmful emissions. For while the older generation who are mostly complicit in the emission will experience some of the effects of climate change, the young generation will bear the full brunt of hazardous gasses in subsequent years.</p>
