<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Meridional (north–south) overturning circulation in the <em>ocean</em> quantified by zonal (east–west) sums of mass transports in depth or density layers.</p>
<p>In the North Atlantic, away from the subpolar regions, the MOC (which is in principle an observable quantity) is often identified with the thermohaline circulation (THC), which is a conceptual and incomplete interpretation. The MOC is also driven by wind, and can also include shallower overturning cells such as occur in the upper ocean in the tropics and subtropics, in which warm (light) waters moving poleward are transformed to slightly denser waters and subducted equatorward at deeper levels.</p>
