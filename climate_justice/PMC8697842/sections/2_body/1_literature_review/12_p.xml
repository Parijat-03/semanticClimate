Recently, R&#252;stemo&#287;lu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>) conducted a decomposition analysis for Turkish CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at aggregated and sector levels for the period between 1990 and 2017. Although Turkey-related decomposition analysis studies mainly used the LMDI method, R&#252;stemo&#287;lu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>) performed the analysis by utilizing the Shapley method. The analysis focused on the effects of five factors in changes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, such as scale effect, migration effect, population, energy intensity, and carbon intensity, at the aggregated level. Regarding the sector-level analysis, the electricity and heat production sectors were considered, and the effects of four factors on emissions (income effect, electricity intensity, fuel structure, and pollution coefficient) were computed. Empirical results of the study showed that Turkey&#8217;s total emissions decreased only due to the energy intensity factor. For electricity and heat production activities, it was reported that the pollution coefficient was the only factor that reduced Turkey&#8217;s sectoral CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
