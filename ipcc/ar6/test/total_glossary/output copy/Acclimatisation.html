<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A change in functional or morphological traits occurring once or repeatedly (e.g., seasonally) during the lifetime of an individual organism in its natural environment. Through acclimatisation, the individual maintains performance across a range of environmental conditions. For a clear differentiation between findings in laboratory and field studies, the term âacclimationâ is used in ecophysiology for the respective phenomena when observed in well-defined experimental settings. The term â(adaptive) plasticityâ characterises the generally limited scope of changes in phenotype that an individual can reach through the process of acclimatisation.</p></dd>
