Direct exposure to desert dust storm can reduce energy generation ef&#64257;ciency of solar panels by 70&#8211;80% in one hour (Ghazi et al. 2014). (Saidan et al. 2016) indicated that in the conditions of Baghdad, Iraq, one month&#8217;s exposure to weather reduced the ef&#64257;ciency of solar modules by 18.74% due to dust deposition. In the Atacama desert, Chile, one month&#8217;s exposure reduced thin-&#64257;lm solar module performance by&#160;3.7&#8211;4.8% (Fuentealba et al. 2015). This has important implications for climate change mitigation efforts using the expansion of solar and wind energy generation in dryland areas for substituting fossil fuels. Abundant access to solar energy in many dryland areas makes them high-potential locations for the installation of solar energy generating infrastructure. Increasing deserti&#64257;cation, resulting in higher frequency and intensity of dust storms imposes additional costs for climate change mitigation through deployment of solar and wind energy harvesting facilities in dryland areas. Most frequently used solutions to this problem involve physically wiping or washing the surface of solar devices with water. These result in additional costs and excessive use of already scarce water resources and labour (Middleton 2017). The use of special coatings on the surface of solar panels can help prevent the deposition of dusts (Costa et al. 2016; Costa et al. 2018; Gholami et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="290.4" top="327.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 327.42; y1: 337.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="327.42" x1="290.4">1.4.2.7 Impacts on transport infrastructure through dust storms and sand movement </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="291.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 291.52; y1: 301.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="291.52" x1="313.22">Dust storms and movement of sand dunes often threaten the safety and operation of railway and road infrastructure in arid and hyper-arid areas, and can lead to road and airport closures due to reductions in visibility. For example, the dust storm on 10 March 2009 over Riyadh was assessed to be the strongest in the previous two decades in Saudi Arabia, causing limited visibility, airport shutdown and damages to infrastructure and environment across the city (Maghrabi et al. 2011). There are numerous historical examples of how moving sand dunes led to the forced decommissioning of early railway lines built in Sudan, Algeria, Namibia and Saudi Arabia in the late 19th and early 20th century (Bruno et al. 2018). Currently, the highest concentrations of railways vulnerable to sand movements are located in north-western China, Middle East and North Africa (Bruno et al. 2018; Cheng and Xue 2014). In China, sand dune movements are periodically disrupting the railway transport on the Linhai&#8211;Ceke line in north-western China and on the Lanzhou&#8211;Xinjiang High-speed Railway in western China, with considerable clean-up and maintenance costs (Bruno et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2010). There are large-scale plans for expansion of railway networks in arid areas of China, Central Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and eastern Africa.

To illustrate, Hsiang et al. (2013) found that each one standard deviation increase in temperature or rainfall was found to increase interpersonal violence by&#160;4% and intergroup con&#64258;ict by 14% (Hsiang et al. 2013). However, this conclusion was disputed by Buhaug et al. (2014), who found no evidence linking climate variability to violent con&#64258;ict after replicating Hsiang et al. (2013) by studying only violent con&#64258;icts. Almer et al. (2017) found that a&#160;one standard deviation increase in dryness raised the likelihood of riots in Sub-Saharan African countries by&#160;8.3% during the 1990&#8211;2011 period. On the other hand, Owain and Maslin (2018) found that droughts and heatwaves were not signi&#64257;cantly affecting the level of regional con&#64258;ict in East Africa. Similarly, it was suggested that droughts and deserti&#64257;cation in the Sahel played a&#160;relatively minor role in the con&#64258;icts in the Sahel in the 1980s, with the major reasons for the con&#64258;icts during this period being political, especially the marginalisation of pastoralists (Benjaminsen 2016), corruption and rent-seeking (Benjaminsen et al. 2012). Moreover, the role of environmental factors as the key drivers of con&#64258;icts was questioned in the case of Sudan (Verhoeven 2011) and Syria (De Ch&#226;tel 2014). Selection bias, when the literature focuses on the same few regions where con&#64258;icts occurred and relates them to climate change, is a&#160;major shortcoming, as it ignores other cases where con&#64258;icts did not occur (Adams et al. 2018) despite degradation of the natural resource base and extreme weather events. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="444.14" top="267.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.52; y0: 267.42; y1: 277.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="267.42" x1="444.14">1.4.2.9 Impacts on migration</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="243.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 243.52; y1: 253.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.52" x1="571.78">Environmentally induced migration is complex and accounts for multiple drivers of mobility as well as other adaptation measures undertaken by populations exposed to environmental risk (</span><span style="x0: 553.66; x1: 558.24; y0: 219.53; y1: 229.03; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="553.66" y0="219.53" x1="571.78">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 362.6; x1: 365.24; y0: 207.53; y1: 217.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="362.6" y0="207.53" x1="403.4">).
