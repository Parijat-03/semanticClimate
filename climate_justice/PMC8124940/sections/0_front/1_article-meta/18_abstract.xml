<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><p>Climate change and rapid urbanization currently pose major challenges for equitable development in megacities of the Global South, such as Delhi, India. This study considers how urban social inequities are distributed in terms of burdens and benefits by quantifying exposure through an urban heat risk index (UHRI), and proximity to greenspace through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), at the ward level in Delhi. Landsat derived remote sensing imagery for May and September 2011 is used in a sensitivity analysis of varying seasonal exposure. Multivariable models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) reveal significant statistical associations (<italic>p</italic> &lt; <italic>0</italic>.05) between UHRI/NDVI and several indicators of social vulnerability. For example, the proportions of children (&#946; = 0.922, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024) and agricultural workers (&#946; = 0.394, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016) are positively associated with the May UHRI, while the proportions of households with assets (&#946; = &#8722;1.978, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) and households with electricity (&#946; = &#8722;0.605, <italic>p</italic> = 0.010) are negatively associated with the May UHRI. In contrast, the proportions of children (&#946; = 0.001, <italic>p</italic> = 0.633) and agricultural workers (&#946; = 0.002, <italic>p</italic> = 0.356) are not significantly associated with the May NDVI, while the proportions of households with assets (&#946; = 0.013, <italic>p</italic> = 0.010) and those with electricity (&#946; = 0.008, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) are positively associated with the May NDVI. Our findings emphasize the need for future research and policies to consider how socially vulnerable groups are inequitably exposed to the impact of climate change-related urban heat without the mitigating effects of greenspace.</p></abstract>
