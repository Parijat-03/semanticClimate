Such a serious legitimacy crisis for the UN spurred Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to convene a High-Level Conference on World Food Security in June 2008. Its outcome nevertheless replicated previous food summits in confirming and intensifying market rule for food regime productive &#8216;efficiency&#8217; (Clapp and Moseley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>: 1395). This was consistent with the new (and belated agricultural) agenda of the World Bank, in its 2008 <italic>World Development Report</italic>, where agriculture would be &#8216;led by private entrepreneurs in extensive value chains linking producers to consumers&#8217;, with the expectation that the private sector would drive &#8216;the organization of value chains that bring the market to smallholders and commercial farms&#8217; (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2007</xref>: 8). This was a key moment in formalizing public&#8211;private partnering which has mushroomed over the last two decades and finds its most virulent form in the WEF&#8217;s scheme to turn the UN <italic>inside out</italic> to establish a private&#8211;public partnership (Gleckman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>).</p>
