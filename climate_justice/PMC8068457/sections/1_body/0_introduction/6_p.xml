Paragraph&#160;7 requires parties to explain how their NDC contributes to the achievement of the global average temperature stabilization goal defined in the UNFCCC and more precisely in the PA. Based on these requirements, it is necessary to establish references that can be used by parties to define their specific contribution in order to achieve the global temperature goals and, at the same time, that can be used to measure the degree of justice and ambition of their contributions.</p>
