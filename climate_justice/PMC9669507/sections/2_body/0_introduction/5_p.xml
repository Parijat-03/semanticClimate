emotionality in public response to predictive models in journalism, how these models
can encourage action-oriented responses and collective planning around
responsibility for taking future actions, and the type of supportive and critical
comments that these models trigger among commenters. Predictive journalism has an
apparent capacity for impacting public emotions, attitudes, and behavior, which are
consequential to the ways in which the public makes sense of news information.
Developing this typology of responses is an important initial contribution toward
understanding the range of responses to predictive journalism that can inform future
research in operationalizing such responses as well as suggest ways for journalistic
practice to better communicate predictions and forecasts about the future. This work
thus outlines a first step in a larger research program examining the role of
predictive journalism in the news media, and how this genre of journalism may shape
public attitudes and opinions about future events and public policy for a variety of
social processes that are predicted in the news.</p>
