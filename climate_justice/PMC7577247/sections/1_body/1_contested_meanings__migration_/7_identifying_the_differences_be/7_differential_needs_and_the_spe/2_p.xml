<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0125">The choice to migrate or retreat is not an easy one and can have varying ramifications for the population on the move, those left behind, neighboring communities, and for places where people resettle. It can also have significant implications for the local economy of these different communities. Drawing on existing literature, we develop a gradient for understanding the spectrum of risk (from high to low) in the context of climate-induced mobilities (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
). We designed this simple visualization to assist adaptation planners and policy makers to better determine who is being targeted by which policies, what resources or support is needed by which groups, and when these resources must be made available to avoid high risk situations.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Spectrum of risks and climate-induced mobilities.
