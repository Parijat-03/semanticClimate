<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Regression analysis showed that for Latinx populations the associations for California neighborhoods were more than twice as large (6.41 vs. 2.92) as those for non-California neighborhoods on extreme heat days, and nearly three times as large (3.03 vs. 1.084) for nighttime temperatures. Our model predicts heavily Latinx neighborhoods (75th percentile) in California to be 1.8 &#176;C (3.2 &#176;F) degrees warmer than less densely populated Latinx neighborhoods (25th percentile) on an extreme heat day. This is nearly three times the disparity for Latinx neighborhoods in Southwestern urban areas outside of California. On average heat days, our model predicts that 75th percentile Latinx neighborhoods will be 1.7 &#176;C (3.1 &#176;F) degrees warmer than less densely Latinx neighborhoods in California, compared with a similar disparity of 0.7 &#176;C (1.3 &#176;F) degrees within metro regions in the rest of the Southwest. For Black populations under extreme heat and average heat days, the California coefficients were double those of non-California cities (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-00941">Appendix A</xref>).</p>
