      <td>policies aimed at improving water use efficiency in different sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture and industry, or\npublic advocacy campaigns raising societal awareness and bringing about behavioural change to reduce wasteful water consumption\nin the residential sector are among such drought risk mitigation policies (Tsakiris 2017). Public outreach and monitoring of\ncommunicable diseases, air and water quality were found to be useful for reducing health impacts of droughts (Yusa et al. 2015). The\nevidence from household responses to drought in Cape Town, South Africa, between 2015 and 2017, suggests that media coverage\nand social media could play a decisive role in changing water consumption behaviour, even more so than official water consumption\nrestrictions (Booysen et al. 2019). Drought risk mitigation approaches are less costly than providing drought relief after the occurrence\nof droughts. To illustrate, Harou et al. (2010) found that establishment of water markets in California considerably reduced drought\ncosts. Application of water saving technologies reduced drought costs in Iran by 282 million USD (Salami et al. 2009). Booker et al.\n(2005) calculated that inter-regional trade in water could reduce drought costs by 20&#8211;30% in the Rio Grande basin, USA. Increasing\nrainfall variability under climate change can make the forms of index insurance based on rainfall less efficient (Kath et al. 2019).\nA number of diverse water property instruments, including instruments allowing water transfer, together with the technological\nand institutional ability to adjust water allocation, can improve timely adjustment to droughts (Hurlbert 2018). Supply-side water\nmanagement, providing for proportionate reductions in water delivery, prevents the important climate change adaptation option\nof managing water according to need or demand (Hurlbert and Mussetta 2016). Exclusive use of a water market to govern water\nallocation similarly prevents the recognition of the human right to water at times of drought (Hurlbert 2018). Policies aiming to secure\nland tenure, and to expand access to markets, agricultural advisory services and effective climate services, as well as to create off-farm\nemployment opportunities, can facilitate the adoption of drought risk mitigation practices (Alam 2015; Kusunose and Lybbert 2014),\nincreasing resilience to climate change (Section 3.6.3), while also contributing to SLM (Sections 3.6.3 and 4.8.1, and Table 5.7).</td>

      <td>The excessive burden of drought relief funding on public budgets is already leading to a paradigm shift towards proactive drought risk\nmitigation instead of reactive drought relief measures (Verner et al. 2018; Wilhite 2016). Climate change will reinforce the need for\nsuch proactive drought risk mitigation approaches. Policies for drought risk mitigation that are already needed now will be even more\nrelevant under higher warming levels (Jerneck and Olsson 2008; McLeman 2013; Wilhite et al. 2014). Overall, there is high confidence\nthat responding to droughts through ex post drought relief measures is less efficient compared to ex ante investments into drought\nrisk mitigation, particularly under climate change.</td>
