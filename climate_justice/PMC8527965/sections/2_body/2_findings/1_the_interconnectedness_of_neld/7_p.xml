Loss of land and the deep connections to land have cascading risks to cultural and spiritual values. For instance, loss of land results in direct &#8220;loss of traditional and sacred grounds such as burial grounds, old village sites, cultural sites, sacred fishing grounds, traditional trees and plants, [and] traditional habitation&#8221; (participant #29, 2020). These losses multiply and indirectly result in further losses such as the &#8220;loss of traditional knowledge (that comes with loss of natural/native resources), loss of cultural ties to their land, loss of traditional family/vanua ties that comes with displacement, etc.&#8221; (participant #29, 2020). Losing land means cascading &#8220;loss [of] our cultural sites and medicines and place of practicing our custom songs and dances&#8221; (participant #19, 2020). It is the interactions and interconnectedness between people and land that give rise to culture heritage (e.g. knowledge, traditional customs, cultural practices, way of life) but also learning, self-esteem, security and sense of identity (Movono et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>; Campbell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Ford et al. 2020). The interconnectedness of these elements illustrates that &#8216;loss&#8217; is messy with one category or &#8216;type&#8217; interplaying with other categories. It is therefore critical that NELD studies, and the policy and practice that flows thereafter, consider the interconnectedness of NELD, as understood and described by participants in this study.</p>
