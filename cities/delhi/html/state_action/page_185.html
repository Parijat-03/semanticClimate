In Delhi, the projected increase in temperature and intensity of monsoons (refer to background) can lead to an increase in heat stress related disorders and in the incidence of infectious diseases.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="120.76" top="696.75"><span x0="72.02" y0="696.75" x1="120.76" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 696.75; y1: 708.75; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure</span><span x0="120.74" y0="696.75" x1="526.14" style="x0: 120.74; x1: 124.08; y0: 696.75; y1: 708.75; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: Citizens of Delhi are prone to heat stress related disorders due to the harsh summers, such as heat strokes, increase in eye diseases like cataract, dry eyes, respiratory disorders and skin diseases. In recent years, Delhi has experienced an increase in maximum summer temperatures, with 2006 reporting a maximum temperature of 44.5 &#176;C and leading to death of 53 people in Delhi (Mehrohtra, et al., 2007). It is estimated that for every one degree rise in temperature above 29 &#176;C there will be a four percent increase in risk of mortality (Hajat, et.al 2005). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.42" top="573.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="573.72" x1="526.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 573.72; y1: 585.72; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In addition to heat stress, the changes in climate can also lead to an increased occurrence of vector borne diseases like Dengue and Malaria. The lifecycle of these vectors are dependent on the prevalent temperature and humidity. GCM studies estimate increases of 5 &#8211; 15 percent in risk of these diseases due to climate change by 2100 globally. In addition, lack of adequate drainage and changing rainfall patterns may cause increased water logging, creating favorable conditions for the spread of such diseases. This was experienced in Delhi when in 2010 high rainfall led to a dramatic rise (6,259 in 2010; 1,154 in 2009 and 1,216 in 2008) in Dengue and malaria cases (Telle, 2012). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.07" top="434.76"><span x0="72.02" y0="434.76" x1="526.07" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 434.76; y1: 446.76; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">This increase in transmission, would affect urban areas like Delhi more due to high density of population (11, 297 persons per sq. km) and therefore a large number of people being affected (Bhattacharya, et al., 2006). Delhi also has about half its population living in informal settlements like JJ (Jhoogi-Jhopdi) clusters, slum designated area, unauthorized colonies and resettled colonies. (Delhi Government, 2010), which may be disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of health on climate change. This may be due to lack of basic social amenities and the general trend of low socio-economic status of the population residing in these settlements. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="212.32" top="311.62"><span x0="72.02" y0="311.62" x1="212.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 311.62; y1: 323.62; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">High temperature has also been found to lead to an increase in ozone concentration of the atmosphere with oxides of nitrogen and other hydrocarbon pollutants reacting in the atmosphere to form ozone (Centre for Science and Environment, 2009). In recent times, this trend has been observed in Delhi. This increase in ozone levels may lead to adverse health effects. Ozone worsens symptoms of </span></div></body></html>
