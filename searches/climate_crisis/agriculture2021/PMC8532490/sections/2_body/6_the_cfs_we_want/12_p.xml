The HLPE needs to be better supported with adequate funds and greater latitude to initiate reports on emerging issues and rapidly changing/evolving global conditions, as it did on the impacts of COVID-19 on FSN, and the urgent transformations needed in food systems to end hunger and malnutrition (HLPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). The HLPE could be further strengthened through the direct inclusion of knowledges of indigenous peoples and local communities, and participatory action research. The HLPE is possibly the best example of &#8216;participatory science&#8217; in an international, inter-governmental context and its interface with global policy processes should be more vigorously promoted (Clapp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>; Moseley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>).</p>
