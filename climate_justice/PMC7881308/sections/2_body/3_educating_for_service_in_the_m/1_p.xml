At Monash University, the implementation of social distancing requirements meant it simply was not possible to have clients, students, and staff attending at our clinic sites. The clinical programme had to move to remote forms of client service and student learning that did not involve face-to-face engagement. This transition was made easier by the programme&#8217;s recent experience with developing a range of virtual and remote forms of service delivery.</p>
