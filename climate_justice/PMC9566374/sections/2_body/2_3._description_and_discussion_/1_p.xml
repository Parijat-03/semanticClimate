<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This conceptual framework focuses exclusively on the anthropogenic causes of climate change and considers both the effects that are already happening and those situations that will probably be faced in the future. Emphasis is placed on the need to combine mitigation and adaptation policies to address climate change and its impacts on health in the long term, but also to provide an immediate response to the difficulties that the climate emergency is already posing, especially for the most vulnerable groups. By focusing on cities with a Mediterranean climate, and mainly middle- and high-income cities, it may miss aspects that may be relevant in other contexts.</p>
