The options with moderate-to-large mitigation potential, and no adverse side effects, include options that decrease pressure on land (e.g., by reducing the land needed for food production) and those that help to maintain or increase carbon stores both above-ground (e.g., forest measures, agroforestry, &#64257;re management) and below-ground (e.g., increased soil organic matter or reduced losses, cropland and grazing land management, urban land management, reduced deforestation and forest degradation). These options also have co-bene&#64257;ts for adaptation by improving health, increasing yields, &#64258;ood attenuation and reducing urban heat island effects. Another group of practices aim at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources, such as livestock management or nitrogen fertilisation management. Land-based options delivering climate change adaptation may be structural (e.g.,&#160;irrigation and drainage systems, &#64258;ood and landslide control), technological (e.g., new adapted crop varieties, changing planting zones and dates, using climate forecasts), or socio-economic and institutional (e.g., regulation of land use, associativity between farmers). Some adaptation options (e.g., new planting zones, irrigation) may have adverse side effects for biodiversity and water. Adaptation options may be planned, such as those implemented at regional, national or municipal level (top-down approaches), or autonomous, such as many technological decisions taken by farmers and local inhabitants. In any case, their effectiveness depends greatly on the achievement of resilience against extreme events (e.g., &#64258;oods, droughts, heat waves, etc.).</span></div><div left="77.53" right="481.13" top="500.69"><span style="x0: 77.53; x1: 82.62; y0: 500.69; y1: 511.69; width: 5.09; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="77.53" y0="500.69" x1="481.13">FAQ 6.2 |  Which land-based mitigation measures could affect deserti&#64257;cation, land degradation&#160;or food security?</span></div><div left="77.53" right="548.11" top="471.33"><span style="x0: 77.53; x1: 81.75; y0: 471.33; y1: 480.83; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="77.53" y0="471.33" x1="548.11">Some options for mitigating climate change are based on increasing carbon stores, both above-ground and below-ground, so mitigation is usually related to increases in soil organic matter content and increased land cover by perennial vegetation. There is a direct relationship, with very few or no adverse side effects for prevention or reversal of deserti&#64257;cation and land degradation and the achievement of food security. This is because deserti&#64257;cation and land degradation are closely associated with soil organic matter losses and the presence of bare ground surfaces. Food security depends on the achievement of healthy crops and high and stable yields over time, which is dif&#64257;cult to achieve in poor soils that are low in organic matter.</span></div><div left="77.53" right="543.55" top="384.52"><span style="x0: 77.53; x1: 82.62; y0: 384.52; y1: 395.52; width: 5.09; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="77.53" y0="384.52" x1="543.55">FAQ 6.3 | What is the role of bioenergy in climate change mitigation, and what are its challenges?</span></div><div left="77.53" right="548.11" top="367.16"><span style="x0: 77.53; x1: 82.1; y0: 367.16; y1: 376.66; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="77.53" y0="367.16" x1="548.11">Plants absorb carbon as they grow. If plant-based material (biomass) is used for energy, the carbon it absorbed from the atmosphere is released back. Traditional use of bioenergy for cooking and heating is still widespread throughout the world. Modern conversion to electricity, heat, gas and liquid fuels can reduce the need to burn fossil fuels and this can reduce GHG emissions, helping to mitigate climate change. However, the total amount of emissions avoided depends on the type of biomass, where it is grown, how it is converted to energy, and what type of energy source it displaces. Some types of bioenergy require dedicated land (e.g., canola for biodiesel, perennial grasses, short rotation woody crops), while others can be co-produced or use agricultural or industrial residues (e.g., residues from sugar and starch crops for ethanol, and manure for biogas). Depending on where, how, and the amount of bioenergy crops that are grown, the use of dedicated land for bioenergy could compete with food crops or other mitigation options. It could also result in land degradation, deforestation or biodiversity loss. In some circumstances, however, bioenergy can be bene&#64257;cial for land, for example, by increasing soil organic carbon. The use of co-products and residues for bioenergy limits the competition for land with food but could result in land degradation if carbon and nutrient-rich material is removed that would otherwise be left on the land. On the other hand, the by-products of some bioenergy conversion processes can be returned to the land as a fertiliser and may have other co-bene&#64257;ts (e.g., reducing pollution associated with manure slurry).</span></div></body></html>
