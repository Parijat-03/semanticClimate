The FEEDS Project provides a digital infrastructure for monitoring, managing, and eventually mitigating adverse climate change&#8211;related impacts on local food systems and mental health. Ultimately, community capacity will ensure the sustainability of this infrastructure. The Advisory Council provides a space for community members, including youth and Elders, to meet and learn from one another. In &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse, adjacent initiatives, including digital literacy programs, are being set up to ensure accessibility and inclusion of community members across all age groups. The FEEDS Project can be adapted and scaled up to other northern communities facing similar environmental and food system challenges.</p>
