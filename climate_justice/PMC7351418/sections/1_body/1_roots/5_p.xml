<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0030">Within environmental justice research and especially advocacy circles, the concept of a just transition is viewed more expansively to include not only concerns about energy and jobs, but also of sustainability and equity. In this context, just transition frameworks encompass a range of issues like food justice, green gentrification, and energy sovereignty <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Organizations in the United States like the Just Transition Alliance (JTA) define a just transition that emphasizes the co-existence of a healthy environment and a strong economy, and that processes and practices necessary to achieve these goals should be inclusive, equitable, and community-driven. The JTA emerged in the mid-1990s out of a formalized Campaign for a Just Transition led by a coalition of labor and environmental justice groups, many rooted in low-income communities and communities of color in opposition to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was viewed as weak on environmental and labor protections <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The JTA has long prioritized issues beyond the workplace to include the regulation of chemical use in manufacturing, workplace safety best practices, expanded job opportunities and the development of innovative income and taxation structures in communities impacted by the closure of pollutive industries, public health advocacy, and more. The JTA has also supported labour-friendly climate policies nationally and internationally and argued for the incorporation of just transition language into global environmental discourse.</p>
