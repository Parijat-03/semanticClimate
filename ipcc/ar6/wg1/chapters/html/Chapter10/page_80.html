The synchronicity of winter rainfall with Antarctic ice-core-derived polar temperature anomalies is consistently revealed in studies using different paleoclimate proxies and time scales of 1400 years (Stager et&#160;al., 2012), about 3000 years (Hahn et&#160;al., 2016) and 12,000&#160;years (Weldeab et&#160;al., 2013). Changes in rainfall regimes at shorter (decadal) time scales appear to reflect influence of local processes such as the Agulhas current&#8217;s interaction with the Atlantic, resulting in changes in SST and coastal upwelling, as well as modification of the wind tracks by topography (Stager et&#160;al., 2012).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="219.47" top="486.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="486.48" x1="219.47" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.5 Model Simulation and Attribution Over&#160;the&#160;Historical&#160;Period</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="450.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="450.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 450.6; y1: 460.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Due to the small scale of the Cape Town region, robust comparison of CMIP simulations to observations is difficult. However, in general, CMIP5 models capture the seasonality well, such as the dominance of austral winter rains, although they overestimate the peak and underestimate the shoulder season rainfall (Mahlalela et&#160;al., 2019). Trends in rainfall are particularly difficult to assess as they are generally weak and depend strongly on the time period and dataset adopted for the analyses (Section&#160;10.6.2.3). A&#160;multi-method attribution study (Otto et&#160;al., 2018) estimates the probability of the 2015&#8211;2017 drought to have increased by a&#160;factor of three since pre-industrial times (with a&#160;wide 95% confidence interval of 1.5 to&#160;6). However, throughout the 20th&#160;century, a&#160;substantial portion of the global models (about 36% of CMIP5 and 44% of CMIP6 models, as well as many of the MIROC SMILE members) simulate a&#160;statistically significant (95%&#160;level) decline in total annual rainfall, while there is no robust long-term trend in observations (Figure&#160;10.18). Section&#160;10.4 offers a&#160;more detailed assessment of attribution challenges.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.81" top="234.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="234.6" x1="298.81" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.55; y0: 234.6; y1: 244.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Global models capture the overall behaviour of the observed main hemispherical processes, such as the expansion of the tropics, a&#160;positive trend in SAM and the poleward shift of the westerly jet. However, they fail to capture details of their observed climatology and variability (Simpson and Polvani, 2016), and the magnitudes of simulated trends vary, though the models typically underestimate observed trends in these processes (Purich et&#160;al., 2013; Staten et&#160;al., 2018). In general, CMIP5 models do capture the SAM-regional rainfall association, although not consistently across all seasons (Purich et&#160;al., 2013; E.-P. Lim et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="286.89" top="102.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="102.48" x1="286.89" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 102.48; y1: 112.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.6 Future Climate Information from Global Simulations</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.82" top="78.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="78.6" x1="298.82" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.55; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Global models show strong consistency in a&#160;drying signal for the Cape Town region, with the reduction in total annual rainfall of up to 20% by the end of the 21st&#160;century in CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 </span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.66; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">across the models is a&#160;robust signal compared to the rest of southern Africa, where the climate change signal varies spatially: stronger drying in the west and moderate drying or weak wetting in the east (DEA, 2013, 2018; see Atlas.4.4 for further discussion of southern Africa precipitation projections). Rainfall changes projected for the Cape Town region are consistent with projected changes in hemispheric-scale processes and regional-scale dynamics that point toward reduced frequency of frontal systems affecting that&#160;region. These changes include robust signals in CMIP5 models for the Southern Hemisphere for a&#160;poleward expansion of the tropics (Hu&#160;et&#160;al., 2013b), poleward displacement of mid-latitude storm tracks (Chang et&#160;al., 2012), increased strength and poleward shift of the westerly winds (Bracegirdle et&#160;al., 2018) and subtropical jet-streams (Chenoli et&#160;al., 2017), and a&#160;shift toward a&#160;more positive phase of the SAM (E.-P. Lim et&#160;al., 2016). However, despite the consistency in circulation changes, the emergence of anthropogenic rainfall change above unforced variability in West Southern Africa remains uncertain for annual rainfall throughout most of the 21st&#160;century, even under SSP5-8.5 (Figure&#160;10.15).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="486.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="486.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is also a&#160;substantial increase in the frequency of conditions supporting atmospheric rivers and water vapour transport towards the south-west coast of southern Africa in the projected climate (Espinoza et&#160;al., 2018). This behaviour has strong implications for the region, as most topographically high locations receive rainfall from persistent atmospheric rivers (Blamey et&#160;al., 2018). A&#160;thorough understanding of the role of atmospheric rivers in the Cape Town region under a&#160;changing climate is missing.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="474.12" top="378.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="378.48" x1="474.12" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 378.48; y1: 388.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.7 Future Climate Information from Regional&#160;Downscaling</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="342.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="342.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Dynamical downscaling studies implemented with a&#160;stretched-grid model (Engelbrecht et&#160;al., 2009) revealed a&#160;signal compatible with the driving CMIP5 ensemble, that is, consistent drying throughout the region, amplifying in time, irrespective of the considered emissions scenario and the generation of global models (DEA, 2013, 2018). A&#160;multi-model CORDEX ensemble indicates a&#160;robust signal of reduction of total annual rainfall in the future, although there is less agreement on how changes in rainfall occurrence may evolve in the region, such as through fewer consecutive rain days or longer dry spells (Abiodun et&#160;al., 2017; Ma&#250;re et&#160;al., 2018). For the end of the century under RCP8.5, Dosio et&#160;al. (2019) also found drying. Moreover, in their analysis, the drying is associated with an increase in the number of consecutive dry days and a&#160;reduction in number of rainy days. Their results are consistent with the driving global models for all the precipitation indices, and they are robust independent of the choice of the regional climate model (RCM) or global model. However, collectively, these analyses indicate that uncertainty remains in the characteristics of the precipitation decrease.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="428.37" top="114.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="114.48" x1="428.37" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.8 Storyline Approaches</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="90.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="90.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is a&#160;consistency in rainfall projections with the projections of rainfall drivers and with the general understanding of the influence of&#160;global warming on the circulation dynamics and rainfall patterns in the region.
