By recognising and examining particular mobility needs, experiences, values and practices, the papers show how transport and mobility (in)justice emerge from the everyday practices of various urban actors. These include not only the mothers, transgender people and low-income groups who experience and try to resist injustice, but also the policy-makers, transport system operators, employers and others whose practices help shape mobility practices and transport systems. As such, these papers demonstrate the need to fully recognise the complex ways and scales at which differential (im)mobilities exist and are (re)produced.</p>
