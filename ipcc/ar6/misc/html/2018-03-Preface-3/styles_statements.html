The results presented here are based on an extensive assessment of scienti&#64257; c literature, including speci&#64257; cs of individual studies, but also an aggregate across studies analyzed for broader conclusions. The report combines information on technology speci&#64257; c studies with results of large-scale integrated models, and provides policy-relevant (but not policy-prescriptive) information to decision makers on the characteristics and technical potentials of different resources; the historical development of the technologies; the challenges of their integration and social and environmental impacts of their use; as well as a comparison in levelized cost of energy for commercially available renewable technologies with recent non-renewable energy costs. Further, the role of renewable energy sources in pursuing GHG concentration stabilization levels discussed in this report and the presentation and analysis of the policies available to assist the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies in cli-mate change mitigation and/or other goals answer important questions detailed in the original scoping of the report. </span></div><div left="156.04" right="205.2" top="494.87"><span style="x0: 156.04; x1: 160.85; y0: 494.87; y1: 504.87; width: 4.81; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="156.04" y0="494.87" x1="205.2" class="s2">The process</span></div><div left="156.04" right="581.53" top="468.97"><span style="x0: 156.04; x1: 160.26; y0: 468.97; y1: 478.47; width: 4.22; fill: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];" x0="156.04" y0="468.97" x1="581.53" class="s1">This report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the IPCC and used for previ- ous assessment reports.
