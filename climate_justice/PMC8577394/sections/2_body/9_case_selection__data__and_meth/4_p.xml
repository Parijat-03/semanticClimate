Sociologists have long shown how post-disaster situations can be leveraged as special opportunities for research, as the excessive circumstances they produce put underlying everyday power relations and social conditions into sharper relief than usual (Erikson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1976</xref>; Klinenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1999</xref>; Molotch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1970</xref>). The claim dates back to the Durkheim school of sociology, as Marcel Mauss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1985</xref>) wrote that extremes are marked by &#8220;an excessiveness which allows us better to perceive the facts than in those places where, although no less essential, they still remain small-scale and involuted.&#8221; Cities are particularly apt places to study the post-disaster process: A &#8220;great city,&#8221; Robert Park (Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1915</xref>) wrote, &#8220;lay[s] bare to the public view in a massive manner all the human character and traits which are ordinarily obscured and suppressed in smaller communities.&#8221;</p>
