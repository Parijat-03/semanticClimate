The focus on a single project in one neighborhood precludes comparisons of how design and construction of climate infrastructure plays out across different neighborhoods. Analyzing how the envisioning of flood-protective infrastructure takes place in the Lower East Side compared to, for example, the financial district to the south or a more socially&#160;homogenouslyneighborhood in the city&#8217;s outer boroughs, could reveal important patterns of how planning for climate infrastructure reproduces urban inequality. What level of protection from devastating flooding does the city provide in the financial district of Manhattan versus outer lying areas in the city? Who gets to have a voice in designing plans in the financial district versus a low-income Brooklyn or Queens neighborhood? Are the roles of the political constituencies&#160;identified here&#160;-&#160;property developers, activists, public housing residents, and city professionals&#160;- different across neighborhoods, and if so, howhow do these differences produce variations in plans? These questions, as Klinenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>)&#160;argue, are likely to form the heart of environmental justice research in the coming decades. The LES effectively shows conflicts over democracy,&#160;expertise, and representation, but broadening the scope to other climate infrastructure projects could reveal other important social dimensions.</p>
