In this instance, the justification is due to the argument that when countries succeed in improving emissions efficiency they can realize a higher level of wellbeing with the same emission budget. Justice is concerned with both fair shares of wellbeing and absolute levels of wellbeing not only in terms of all reaching the critical level, but also above the sufficiency level. In its economic interpretation both relative and aggregative welfare are important concerns. Among other principles, the so-called priority view takes into account both distributive and aggregative concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Other things being equal (here if the likelihood of reaching the 2030 reduction goal remains the same) it is better when the EU 27 reach the goal with an on average higher per capita level of welfare, enabled by an expansion of renewables. Given the high interdependencies within the EU it seems likely that welfare gains realized in one country will benefit people in other countries of the EU as well. Countries can be understood to be responsible for such renewable expansion measures since they have become liable for their emission-generating activities. The proxy for success of such measures&#8212;and granting an increased budget as a consequence&#8212;is the increase in the share of renewables.</p>
