Mass unemployment and the failure of businesses have required governments around the world to respond with stimulus packages and longer-term planning for economic recovery. This economic shock has placed the global climate response at a crossroads. The International Energy Agency has warned that &#8216;[g]overnments have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape a better energy future&#8217; (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). How could such an opportunity be realised? Prior to the announcement of most 2020 recovery packages, Hepburn et al. applied the lessons of financial crisis fiscal responses to the current crisis. They concluded that &#8216;green stimulus policies often have advantages over traditional fiscal stimulus&#8217; (Hepburn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>, S366). Based on a survey of economic officials and other economists from 53 countries, the authors concluded that the most desirable recovery policies would simultaneously deliver long-run economic multipliers and strong positive climate impacts. They also noted that such recovery policies should also address &#8216;existing societal and political concerns&#8212;such as poverty alleviation, inequality, and social inclusion&#8217; (Ibid, S364). Based on this analysis, Hepburn et al. recommended that recovery packages include clean infrastructure investment, building efficiency retrofits, education and training to address unemployment (including as a result of decarbonisation), natural capital and clean R&amp;D investment and, for lower-to-middle-income countries, rural support spending (Ibid, S374-75).</p>
