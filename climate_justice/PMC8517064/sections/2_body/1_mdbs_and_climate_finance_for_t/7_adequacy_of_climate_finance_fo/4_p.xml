IFAD is an MDB that established a separate fund specifically aimed at adaptation actions to accompany their lending activities. Under the adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) climate finance is channelled to small-scale producers, though not at the scale that is or will be needed by 2030. In 2019 IFAD committed about US$568 million in climate finance across 38 approved projects. Of this total, US$507 million has been identified as adaptation finance and about US$61 million as mitigation finance (IFAD,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>).</p>
