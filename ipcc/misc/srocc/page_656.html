This will increase the number of people vulnerable to climate change, due to population increases and increasing climate impacts (IPCC 2018; AR 5). Future climate change will lead to exacerbation of the existing land challenges, increased pressure on agricultural livelihoods, potential for rapid land degradation, and millions more people exposed to food insecurity (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 2007) (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Delay can also bring political risks and signi&#64257;cant social impacts, including risks to human settlements (particularly in coastal areas), large-scale migration, and con&#64258;ict (Barnett and Adger 2007; Hsiang et&#160;al. 2013). Early action reducing vulnerability and exposure can create an opportunity for a virtual circle of bene&#64257;ts: increased resilient livelihoods, reduced degradation of land, and improved food security (Bohle et&#160;al. 1994). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="281.28" top="135.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.51; y0: 135.57; y1: 145.07; width: 5.98; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="135.57" x1="281.28">Delayed action increases requirements for adaptation: </span><span style="x0: 281.85; x1: 285.89; y0: 135.57; y1: 145.07; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="281.85" y0="135.57" x1="307.97">Failure to mitigate climate change will increase requirements for adaptation.

The cost of inaction to address mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable land use exceeds the cost of immediate action in most countries, depending on how damage functions and the social cost of carbon are calculated (Dell et&#160;al. 2012; Moore and Diaz 2015). Costs of acting now would be one to two orders of magnitude lower than economic damages from delayed action, including damage to assets from climate impacts, as well as potentially reduced economic growth, particularly in developing countries (Luderer et&#160;al. 2016; Moore and Diaz 2015; Luderer et&#160;al. 2013).
