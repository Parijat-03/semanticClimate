Extension primarily works in agriculture, community development, conservation, and youth programs. Extension is the development arm of the land grant institution in the sense that they work to build human capacities and expand economic opportunities (Peters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>). Extension partners with hundreds of organizations and community groups. Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE), for example, is comprised of Virginia Tech and Virginia State, an HBCU, and has 34,000 volunteers, most of these in 4H, as well as numerous community educators.</p>
