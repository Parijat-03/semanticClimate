The report by Psaraftis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2021</xref>) revealed that it was agreed at this meeting to call for proposals in 2022 for evaluation in 2023, but any urgent discussion of the matter was postponed. The meeting was unexpectedly controversial, however, due to the discussion of a proposal made in December 2019 by the International Chamber of Shipping but deferred at MEPC 75. The ICS proposed a carbon levy of two USD per tonne of fuel, not necessarily as an attempt to reduce emissions directly but to create a research fund. Those against MBMs were unsurprisingly against the levy, but even those in favour of MBMs did not support the proposal, fearing that it would detract from attempts to agree a future MBM of any serious level. The discussion was postponed to the next meeting.</p>
