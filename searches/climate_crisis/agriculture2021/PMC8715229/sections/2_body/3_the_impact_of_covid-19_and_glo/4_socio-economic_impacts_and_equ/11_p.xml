The exposure risk increases for food service employees in locations where the markets are crowded, sanitation facilities are limited, and cash is the primary form of currency. Informal and formal markets have been closed, either permanently or temporarily, until facilities could be retrofitted to limit the spread of COVID-19. These closures have been particularly detrimental for food systems where markets play a central role in selling and accessing foodstuffs. Markets that can implement social distancing measures, provide handwashing or hand-sanitation stations, and accept cashless payment options have been allowed to remain open in many countries, despite the lockdown measures.</p>
