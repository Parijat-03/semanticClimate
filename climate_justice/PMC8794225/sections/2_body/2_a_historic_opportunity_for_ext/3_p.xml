COVID 19 increased demand sharply across Extension program areas. While welcome, these demands outstripped Extension&#8217;s capacity, both in funds and personnel, which have been weakened by years of tight budgets following the trend toward privatization of public-sector programs (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>; Coppess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>).
