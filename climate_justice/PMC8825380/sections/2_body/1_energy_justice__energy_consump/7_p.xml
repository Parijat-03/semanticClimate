This choice is consistent with most moral intuitions. However, because greater improvements in the HDI would result from focusing resources on the healthier individuals whose life expectancy can be extended more cheaply, through access to &#8216;the most basic nutrition, sanitation, and medical care&#8217;, use of the HDI to determine what energy justice requires would lead to withholding of &#8216;scarce resources from those who have special needs that make their life expectancy more expensive to extend&#8217; (Pogge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>: 213).</p>
