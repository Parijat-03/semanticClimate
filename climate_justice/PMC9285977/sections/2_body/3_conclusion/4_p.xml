<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The &#8220;good governance&#8221; literature has dominated the past decade of urban climate research. As a result, this literature has struggled to move beyond generic recommendations for improving governance to context&#8208; and place&#8208;specific recommendations about how to foster change on the ground. This re&#8208;centering of the debate around normative ideals of institutional development diverts attention again from the crucial question that inspires research on climate change governance in urban areas today: are we changing, and will that change be sufficient? The increasing urgency of climate change has catalyzed a search for universal solutions that paradoxically may have diverted attention from the material realities and the very individuals that ultimately join and drive climate actions. What is largely missing&#8212;although there is a nascent body of work that points towards alternatives&#8212;is a sober assessment of the mundane aspects of climate change governance on the ground capable of exploring concerns about what kind of cultural and socio&#8208;economic change is taking place, beyond a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of climate policies.</p>
