      <td>While a rigorous CBA is broader than a purely financial tool and can capture non-market values where they exist, it can prioritise\ncertain values over others (such as profit maximisation for owners, efficiency from the perspective of supply chain processes, and\njudgements about which parties bear the costs). Careful consideration must be given to whose perspectives are considered when\nundertaking a CBA and also to the limitations of these methods for policy interventions.</td>

      <td>Discount rates are increasingly being chosen to reflect concerns about intergenerational equity, and some countries (e.g., the UK and\nFrance) apply a declining discount rate for long-term public projects. The choice of discount rate has important implications for policy\nevaluation (Anthoff, Tol, and Yohe, 2010; Arrow et al., 2014; Baral, Keenan, Sharma, Stork, and Kasel, 2014; Dasgupta et al., 2013;\nLontzek, Cai, Judd, and Lenton, 2015; Sorokin et al., 2015; van den Bergh and Botzen, 2014) (high evidence, high agreement). Stern\n(2007), for example, used a much lower discount rate (giving almost equal weight to future generations) than the mainstream authors\n(e.g., Nordhaus (1941) and obtained much higher estimates of the damage of climate change).</td>

      <td>soil erosion, increased water pollution, nitrification, etc.). Positive externalities include sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO ) and\n2\nimproved soil water filtration from afforestation. Externalities can also be social (e.g., displacement and migration) and economic\n(e.g., loss of productive land). In the context of climate change and land, the major externality is the agriculture, forestry and other\nland-use (AFOLU) sourced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Examples of mechanisms to internalise externalities are discussed in 7.5.</td>

The SCC can be\n2\nused to determine a carbon price, but SCC depends on discount rate assumptions and may neglect processes, including large losses of\nbiodiversity, political instability, violent conflicts, large-scale migration flows, and the effects of climate change on the development\nof economies (Stern 2013; Pezzey 2019).</td>

MAC measures the cost of reducing one more GHG unit and MAC curves are either expert-based or model-\nderived and offer a range of approaches and assumptions on discount rates or available abatement technologies (Moran 2011).</td>
