The most recent decade from 1990 to 2001 was the warmest. The mean annual temperature during the period had a positive MK statistic that was significant at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05 level. The year 1979 was identified as the change point in the mean annual temperature regime by the Mann-Whitney test. The warning due to increased temperature has potential to increase the open water evaporative demand over the lake. Both temperature increases and rainfall decreases have also been reported by other studies (e.g., McSweeney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>, Ngongondo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>). The mean annual open water evaporation over the lake was 1290 mm (CV = 7.44%), with a statistically significant positive MK trend at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05 level for all stations as well as the average. However, the annual mean evaporation is lower than the 1872 mm that was reported by Crossley et al. (1990) for 1954 to 1980. The evaporation from Thornthwaite&#8217;s model was compared with the annual lake evaporation derived from pan measurements for the same stations from 1971 to 1996. It should be noted that these were scanty for which annual values for some years only could be savaged. A pan conversion factor of 1.3 was applied (Linacre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1994</xref>). The pan-derived evaporation were slightly higher (about 2%) than those from Thornthwaite&#8217;s model, but the two were strongly correlated according to Pearson&#8217;s correlation(<italic>&#961;</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;88&#8201;%&#8201;, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), and both having a significant positive MK trend <italic>&#945;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.05). The Thornthwaite model-derived evaporation was therefore considered to be a reasonable estimate of lake evaporation. Furthermore, the weighted mean annual river discharge for all inflowing rivers into the lake considered was 209 mm and did not have a statistically significant MK trend, although Bua and Lufira Rivers had significant positive and negative trends respectively at <italic>&#945;</italic> = 0.05. The mean is lower than the 300 mm found by Owen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1990</xref>) during 1954 and 1980. The Mann-Whitney test identified a change points in river discharge around 2001 and 1977 and 1992 for evaporation, with increases in both variables after the change points.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Inter-decadal monthly mean temperature changes in the Lake Malawi between 1971 and 2001</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p>
