<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0180">A number of deep transformations of food systems are required to ensure sustainability. This includes investigating the impacts of modern models of production and how adaptations in cultivation or animal rearing practices could minimize the overall pressure on ecosystems and the environment. For instance, increasing crop yield and livestock conversion efficiency is achievable in many regions of the world and could both reduce GHG emissions and improve global food security (<xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">Valin et al., 2013</xref>). The transition in livestock production systems appears to be particularly promising (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Havl&#237;k et al., 2014</xref>), as the environmental footprint of this sector is typically twice that of crops (<xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">Steinfeld et al., 2006</xref>). Technical options and structural changes can also be deployed to limit the adverse effects of GHG emissions or other local effects (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2018</xref>). Conservation farming practices that enhance soil organic carbon can even generate win&#8211;win solutions for food security and the environment by increasing crop productivity and increasing the land carbon sink (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
