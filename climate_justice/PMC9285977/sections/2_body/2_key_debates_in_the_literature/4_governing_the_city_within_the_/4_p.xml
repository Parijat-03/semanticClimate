<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Within the second theme of transnational municipal networks (TMNs), the key concern has been how these organizations move beyond traditional regimes in global climate governance. Bulkeley and Betsill analyzed how municipalities used transnational networks as a means to exercise agency and authority on multiple levels (Betsill &amp; Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bulkeley &amp; Betsill, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This led to new theorizations of scale in climate politics and a reimagination of the role of the &#8220;local&#8221; in global regimes, creating a platform for further research on how cities shape international relations. Further contributions included recognition of cities in exercising norm entrepreneurship in global discourses (Toly, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0278" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), new forms of authority produced through consensus building across scales (Bulkeley &amp; Schroeder, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the rise of the urban as a center of power in global politics (Acuto, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Acuto &amp; Rayner, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
