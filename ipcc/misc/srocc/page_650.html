Studies have noted that, while adoption of response options by individuals may depend on individual assets and motivation, larger structural and institutional factors are almost always equally important if not more so (Adimassu et&#160;al. 2016; Djenontin et&#160;al. 2018), though harder to capture in research variables (Schwilch et&#160;al. 2014). These institutional and governance factors can create an enabling environment for sustainable land management (SLM) practices, or challenges to their adoption (Adimassu et&#160;al. 2013). Governance factors include the institutions that manage rules and policies, the social norms and collective actions of participants (including civil society actors and the private sector), and the interactions between them (Ostrom 1990; Huntjens et&#160;al. 2012; Davies 2016). Many of Ostrom&#8217;s design principles for successful governance can be applied to response options for SLM; these principles are: </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="735.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.69; y0: 735.56; y1: 745.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.56" x1="566.09">(i)&#160;clearly de&#64257;ned boundaries, (ii) understanding of both bene&#64257;ts and costs, (iii) collective choice arrangements, (iv) monitoring, (v) graduated sanctions, (vi) con&#64258;ict-resolution mechanisms, (vii) recognition of rights, and (viii) nested (multi-scale) approaches. Unfortunately, studies of many natural resources and land management policy systems&#160;&#8211; in particular, in developing countries&#160;&#8211; often show the opposite: a&#160;lack of &#64258;exibility, strong hierarchical tendencies, and a lack of local participation in institutional frameworks (Ampaire et&#160;al. 2017). Analysis of government effectiveness (GE)&#160;&#8211; de&#64257;ned as quality of public services, policy formulation and implementation, civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, as well as credibility of the government&#8217;s commitment to its policies (Kaufmann et&#160;al. 2010)&#160;&#8211; has been shown to play a key role in land management. GE mediates land-user actions on land management and investment, and government policies and laws can help land users adopt sustainable land management practices (Nkonya et&#160;al. 2016) (Figure 6.9).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="531.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 531.58; y1: 541.08; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="531.58" x1="566.08">It is simply not a matter of putting the &#8216;right&#8217; institutions or policies in place, however, as governance can be undermined by inattention to power dynamics (Fabinyi et&#160;al. 2014). Power shapes how actors gain access and control over resources, and negotiate, transform and adopt certain response options or not. These variable dynamics of power between different levels and stakeholders have an impact on the ability to implement different response options. The inability of many national governments to address social exclusion in general will have an effect on the implementation of many response options. Further, response options themselves can become avenues for actors to exert power claims over others (Nightingale 2017). For example, there have been many concerns that reduced deforestation and forest degradation projects run the risk of reversing trends towards decentralisation in forest management and creating new power disparities between the state and local actors (Phelps et&#160;al. 2010). Below we assess how two important factors&#160;&#8211; the involvement of stakeholders, and the coordination of action across scales&#160;&#8211; will help in moving from response options to policy implementation, a theme Chapter 7 takes up in further detail.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="419.37" top="291.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 291.6; y1: 301.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="318.05" y0="291.6" x1="419.37">Involvement of stakeholders</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="267.61"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 267.61; y1: 277.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="267.61" x1="566.12">A wide range of stakeholders are necessary for successful land, agricultural and environmental policy, and implementing response options requires that a range of actors, including businesses, consumers, land managers, indigenous peoples and local communities, scientists, and policymakers work together for success. Diverse stakeholders have a particularly important role to play in de&#64257;ning problems, assessing knowledge and proposing solutions (Stokes et&#160;al. 2006; Phillipson et&#160;al. 2012). Lack of connection between science knowledge and on-the-ground practice has hampered adoption of many response options in the past; simply presenting &#8216;scienti&#64257;cally&#8217; derived response options is not enough (Marques et&#160;al. 2016). For example, the importance of recognising and incorporating local knowledge and indigenous knowledge is increasingly emphasised in successful policy implementation (see Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 7), as local practices of water management, soil fertility management, improved grazing, restoration and sustainable management of forests are often well-aligned with response options assessed by scientists (Marques et&#160;al. 2016).</span></div></body></html>
