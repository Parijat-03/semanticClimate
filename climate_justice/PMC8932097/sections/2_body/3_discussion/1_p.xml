The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states with &#8220;high confidence&#8221; that climate change is already affecting food insecurity across the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Yet there are still insufficient attempts to quantify this relationship and explore the extent to which it is possible to attribute changes in food security to climate change. Rather, most of the literature addressing climate change impacts focuses on crop yields, production, and productivity, and future impacts of climate change, with much less attention given to the negative impact on food security that is already occurring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Our paper makes three important and distinct contributions to these gaps in the literature.</p>
