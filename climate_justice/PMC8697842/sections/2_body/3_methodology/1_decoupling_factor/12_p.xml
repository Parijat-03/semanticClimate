Ward et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>) argued that decoupling GDP from the environmental impact is not possible because GDP is highly dependent on the consumption of energy and resources. Thus, they suggested that it will be disadvantageous to develop some sustainability projects because decoupling will be expected between GDP and environmental degradation. They also suggested that because GDP has been recently deemed a poor proxy of society's wellbeing, it would be better to focus on defining a new and more comprehensive variable to measure the economic growth.</p>
