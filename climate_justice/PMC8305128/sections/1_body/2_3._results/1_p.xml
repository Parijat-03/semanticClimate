<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Nationally, the incidence and mortality rates in 2020 were 4574 cases per 100,000 habitants and 84 deaths per 100,000 habitants, respectively. Although the yearly PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentration averaged over all communes is below the Chilean and the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards, the maximum annual concentration for both pollutants revealed that there are communes that significantly exceed both air quality standards (<xref rid="ijerph-18-07409-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Demographically, the Chilean population is old, with a high percentage of elderly (above 10%). Socially, some communes have a high proportion of houses with moderate overcrowding and without thermal standards (built before 2000). Climatically, the temperature and humidity indicate that both warm and dry climates are present throughout the studied territory (<xref rid="ijerph-18-07409-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
