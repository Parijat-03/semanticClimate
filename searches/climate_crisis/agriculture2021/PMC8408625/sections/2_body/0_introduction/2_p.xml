Rising temperatures are likely increasing the transmission potential of tropical VBDs in Europe, by affecting the geographic spread, abundance, survival and feeding activity of vector species and benefiting pathogen development in infected vectors <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This, combined with other factors such as human population growth, intensive animal rearing, global commerce, air travel, urbanization and land-use changes, is increasing the chances of novel diseases to enter and emerge in Europe <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
