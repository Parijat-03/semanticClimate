<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Although micro level analyses like those based on participation data from forums and talk pages allow for identifying individual contributors, we would not use these for individual profiling in adherence to privacy-related ethical principles (cf. Cooper et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Accordingly, our units of analysis are single projects, i.e., we characterize projects by certain participation patterns and make comparisons between projects on that basis. Results that rely on meso level content analyses such as the assignment of research areas (cf. Case 2) are also naturally related to projects or groups of projects. The scope of the Twitter-based macro level analysis is usually broader: Case 3 shows how the &#8220;climate of discourse&#8221; can be comparatively assessed between large sets of contributions within and outside the CS community as manifested in the Twitter blogosphere. A plausible explanation is that the context of the community discourse itself, which is more science-oriented within CS, induces a different tone or style.</p>
