<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis that stimulated
journalists to frame their stories around predictive models and forecasts aiming
to predict the future trend of the pandemic. This article examines the audience
response to predictive journalism by qualitatively analyzing readers&#8217; comments
to articles covering COVID that were published in a small sample of mainstream
media. Based on a thematic analysis of readers&#8217; comments, this research
contributes a typology of audience response types to the models incorporated in
such predictive journalism. We elaborate on each of three primary
themes&#8212;reflecting affective, action-oriented, and evaluative responses&#8212;and
discuss the implications of our findings and the importance of expanding
research to answer questions related to the role of predictive journalism in
shaping affective response, encouraging action-oriented responses and collective
planning around responsibility for taking future actions, and considering the
ways in which supportive and critical comments triggered by the models may be
harnessed to improve communication.</p></abstract>
