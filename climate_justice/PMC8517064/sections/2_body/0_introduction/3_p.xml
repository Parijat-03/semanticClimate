<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par11">The aim of this paper is to identify shortcomings with the current system of financing for agricultural adaptation in the context of the kinds of investment needs climate change imposes on poor rural communities and small-scale agriculture and in the process of transforming agri-food system livelihoods. We focus on one of the key segments of the adaptation financing ecosystem&#8212;multi-lateral development banks (MDBs) describing their current roles and functions and identifying ways they may help address some of the shortcomings identified. Rethinking how we design, finance and implement actions and investments needed to improve livelihoods of the worlds&#8217; rural people and ensure their resilience to climate change is fundamental to achieving transformative adaptation. This is an area where the MDBs have great experience as well as capacity, as they are supranational institutions tasked with financing investments to foster social and economic progress in low income countries, and more recently also active in managing climate finance for adaptation as well as mitigation. They include the World Bank, African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). IFAD has been active in financing investments in rural transformation to eradicate poverty and hunger since 1977 and since 2012 has also been active in financing adaptation in the context of rural transformation and agricultural development.</p>
