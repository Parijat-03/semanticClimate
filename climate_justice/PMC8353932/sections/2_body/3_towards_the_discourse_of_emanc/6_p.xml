By posing a provocative question, Franzen nevertheless expanded our imagination of what can be considered meaningful climate actions even <italic>after</italic> the world exceeds 2&#176;C of warming. Such imaginative thinking enables us to see the things that had not been thought of as being related to climate change as the things that are deeply intertwined with&#8212;and thereby bringing new meanings into our social life. Rather than abandoning all hope, Franzen offered a <italic>different</italic> kind of hope&#8212;not the audacious kind embraced by Ocacio-Cortez, but a more humble and pragmatic kind of hope (see also Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020c</xref>). This is what a Norwegian psychologist Per Espen Stoknes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>) called a <italic>grounded hope</italic>: &#8216;It&#8217;s grounded in our being, in our character and calling, not in some expected outcome&#8217;.</p>
