My suggestion is that we should consider procreative parenting as a valuable capability that should be part of the set of capabilities that form the metric of social justice. Capabilities are those beings and doings that we have genuine access to. If we are said to have a capability to X, this means that if we want to do X, we can do X. The doings and beings are called functionings; the corresponding opportunities are called capabilities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn24">24</xref> Procreative parenting is a capability <italic>par excellence</italic>, since it is both a way of being (one is a parent) and a doing (one engages in parenting). The capabilities that make up the metric of justice are those that, upon reflection, we find valuable. This reflection is not a matter of unreflective preferences for certain capabilities, but rather the outcome of a legitimate process of public reasoning and deliberation.</p>
