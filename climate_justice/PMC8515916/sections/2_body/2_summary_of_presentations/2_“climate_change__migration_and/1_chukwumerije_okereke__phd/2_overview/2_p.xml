Coastal nations of West and Central Africa, home to many rapidly growing economic hubs, have low-lying lagoons threatened by sea level rise and therefore erosion, inundation and flooding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Flooding events in Nigeria have already led to large displacements, such as the Niger Delta Flood Disaster in 2012, which forced 2.1 million people to flee their homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the vulnerability of food production systems in Africa to climate change will result in a decline in important economic crops such as Banana and Plantain in West Africa, while Southern Africa is estimated to suffer crop yield losses of 18% by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Desertification, as in the case of the drastic shrinkage of the Lake Chad basin, has led to the southern migration of cattle herders and farmers in search of greener pastures, causing issues of conflict. Pre-existing inadequate health and sanitation infrastructure, water systems and access to health services also exacerbate the health risks of climate change. The growing population, rapid rates of urbanisation, especially in coastal areas, coupled with a heavy reliance on agriculture, poor infrastructure, and poor governance all act to reduce Africa&#8217;s adaptive capacity to a changing climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]<underline>.</underline></p>
