Designed to educate what was then viewed as lay audiences, the primary goal of these institutions (and their exhibitions) was to contribute to scientific knowledge by creating object-rich exhibits, with pieces selected by curators from the research collection and the consequent inclusion of &#8220;authoritative information&#8221; about them (McManus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1992</xref>, p. 160). The displays tended to showcase collections of specimens (often organized by taxonomic groups), artefacts such as instruments used in scientific research and, later, stunning dioramas (see, for example, the dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History). Amodio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>) describes this first generation as one based on the principle of look-but-don&#8217;t-touch, a principle still in use today by science museums around the world (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Replica of a <italic>Cabinet of Curiosities</italic>, Ontario Science Centre, Canada.
