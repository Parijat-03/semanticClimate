Within the 21st century, several aspects play a role for the assessment of <em><a href="#risk" class="mention">risk</a></em> and potential <em>impacts</em> in 1.5°C warmer worlds: the possible occurrence, magnitude and duration of an overshoot; the way in which emissions reductions are achieved; the ways in which policies might be able to influence the <em><a href="#resilience" class="mention">resilience</a></em> of human and natural systems; and the nature of the regional and sub-regional risks. Beyond the 21st century, several elements of the <em><a href="#climate_system" class="mention">climate system</a></em> would continue to change even if the global mean temperatures remain stable, including further increases of sea level.</p></div></dd><div>
