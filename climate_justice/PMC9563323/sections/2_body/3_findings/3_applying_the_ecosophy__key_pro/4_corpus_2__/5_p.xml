<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">From a cursory glance, we can see that there are two phrases that, unlike the others, are localized to just a few files in the corpus: <italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;ve just signed</italic> (ranked #1) and <italic toggle="yes">I demand urgent government</italic> (#10). These are both examples of petition text that has been copied and shared verbatim on Twitter (all Tweets are spread across just two files in the corpus, hence the low range for these particular results). We also note that five out of the top ten clusters are negated phrases (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">I don&#8217;t think</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I don&#8217;t know</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I don&#8217;t want</italic>). Although just a snapshot of the &#8220;I&#8221; instances in Corpus 2, <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_tab_004" ref-type="table">Table&#160;4</xref> paints the picture of a frustrated, uncertain, and disempowered community of citizens faced with the global problem of plastic waste. The two petition examples mentioned above&#160;&#8211; <italic toggle="yes">I&#8217;ve just signed</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">I demand urgent government</italic>, shown in Examples (9) and (10)&#160;&#8211; speak to the theme of reliance on governing or corporate bodies that we saw in the <italic toggle="yes">our customers</italic> examples of Corpus 1.</p>
