It appears to be easier to close things down than to restart them and clinics will have to retain and restore their services in a very difficult economic environment. The context of CLE will be different on &#8216;the other side of the pandemic&#8217;. Some things will have changed forever while there will also be new practices that clinics can and should hold onto as they develop the &#8216;new normal&#8217;.</p>
