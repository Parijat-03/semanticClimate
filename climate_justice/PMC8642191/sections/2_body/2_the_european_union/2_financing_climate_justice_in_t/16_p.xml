EU policy therefore aligns closely with the Paris Agreement&#8217;s Article 2.1c goal to transform finance flows, which is unsurprising given that the EU has been a key proponent of this goal, both during the Paris negotiations and after the Paris Agreement entered into force. It can additionally be seen that within its overarching framework for sustainable finance, specific emphasis has been given to public support for just transition outcomes, notably through the JTM and the Modernisation Fund. This operationalisation of the just transition concept responds to both EU &#8216;cohesion&#8217; policy and demands for intra-EU (and, in a novel departure, even intra-Member State) climate justice. These policy choices highlight the need to address equity and distributional concerns in the redirection of financial flows.</p>
