      <td>The effort towards sustainable intensification has also been\nincorporated in agricultural policies. In Brazil, for instance,\nthe reduction of deforestation, the restoration of degraded\npasture areas, the adoption of integrated agroforestry\nsystems3 and no-till agricultural techniques play a major\nrole in the nation&#8217;s voluntary commitments to reduce GHG\nemissions in the country&#8217;s NAMAs (Mozzer 2011) and\nNDCs (Silva Oliveira et al. 2017; Rochedo et al. 2018). Such\ncommitment under the UNFCCC is operationalised through\nthe Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC),4 which is based on\nlow interest credit for investment in sustainable agricultural\ntechnologies (Mozzer 2011). Direct pasture restoration and\nintegrated systems reduce area requirements (Strassburg\net al. 2014), and increase organic matter (Gil et al. 2015;\nBungenstab 2012; Maia et al. 2009), contributing to overall\nlifecycle emissions reduction (Cardoso et al. 2016; de Oliveira\nSilva et al. 2016). Also, increased adoption of supplementation\nand feedlots, often based on agroindustrial co-products and\nagricultural crop residues are central to improve productivity\nand increase climate resilience of livestock systems (Mottet\net al. 2017a; van Zanten et al. 2018).</td>
