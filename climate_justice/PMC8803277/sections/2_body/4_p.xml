It seems clear that we need to do a better job of walking the talk when it comes to a core principle of a socioecological approach to public health. Unfortunately, both the proximal discussions of incremental, industry-centred focused solutions that dominate climate change discourse and the equally incremental, pharmaceutically centred solutions that dominate COVID-19 discourse suggest we have a long way to go. What is missing is a structural critique of the underlying systems that produce crisis in the first place, that is, the antecedent causes of the causes (Commission on Social Determinants of Health [CSDH], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>) that might get us toward a structural whole-of-society <italic>transformation</italic>.</p>
