Our current development model contains an &#8216;unanswerable question&#8217;, how can climate change mitigation and sufficient levels of development and poverty alleviation be delivered simultaneously? This dilemma manifests spatially as profound inequality in resource use and development outcomes, as well as uneven exposure to climate impacts. The result, overconsumption in the wealthy advanced economies and continuing issues of energy poverty, lack of basic infrastructure and poor Human Development Index (HDI) performance in communities in the poorest nations.</p>
