The label also carries a set of presuppositions and implicatures, including some assumption that the product ordinarily might be expected to, or even <italic toggle="yes">should</italic> contain phosphates, but does not. Cognitive linguistic research on negation thus enables us to understand the potential rhetorical power of negatively framed messaging, which places additional demands on our conceptual processing, challenges our expectations and presuppositions, and has an overall disruptive pragmatic effect in discourse.</p>
