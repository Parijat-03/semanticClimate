Caney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>, 125ff) has divided these between the responsibilities of &#8216;burden-sharing justice&#8217; (each state contributing fairly to mitigation) and &#8216;harm avoidance justice&#8217; (each state doing what they can, beyond domestic mitigation, to prevent catastrophe). Scott has summarised this distinction as &#8216;do your share and encourage/induce others to do theirs to protect the potential victims of climate change&#8217; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>, 98). The &#8216;second-order responsibilities&#8217; of avoiding harm are discharged on the international plain, through activities such as enforcement, incentivisation, enablement, norm creation and undermining resistance to action (Caney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>, 136&#8211;39). It will be seen that the EU is actively addressing both kinds of climate justice responsibility, while China remains more focused on the first. While the EU has sought to accelerate and widen its domestic climate transition, it has simultaneously worked to influence climate outcomes beyond its borders through a growing range of bilateral, inter-regional and global tracks. In contrast, China has been overwhelmingly focused on domestic climate policy, an approach which has produced the contradiction of increasingly ambitious domestic targets set against the high carbon intensity of many Belt and Road projects (Minas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). Xi Jinping&#8217;s September 2021 announcement that China will no longer build coal-fired power projects overseas is a major development in this regard.</p>
