Our modeled estimate of the baseline flood damage to residential properties, including flooding both attributed and not attributed to climate change, is US$ 6.41 billion in Harris County. We estimate the climate change-attributed portion of these damages to be approximately $2.39 billion (37.2%) of total damages in the lower scenario or $3.7 billion (57.8%) in the higher climate change scenario.</p>
