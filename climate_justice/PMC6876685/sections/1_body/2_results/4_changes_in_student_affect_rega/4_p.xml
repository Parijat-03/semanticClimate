Before the course module, 58% reported thinking that humans could reduce climate change but that it was unclear whether they would (Figure <xref rid="ece35736-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The next most common response (37%) was that humans could reduce climate change, but were not willing to change their behavior&#8212;thus no meaningful action would be taken. After the course module, participants continued to report uncertainty regarding whether humans would do what is needed to reduce climate change (64%) or else concluded that humans were unwilling to change their behavior (29%)&#8212;meaning that, by the course's end, 93% of participants were either unsure whether humans would take meaningful action in response to climate change or were confident that humans would not do so. At the end of the course, only 4% reported thinking that humans would successfully reduce climate change. These results suggest that learning more about the science of climate change&#8212;including that humans are the primary cause of climate change&#8212;did not have much impact on student views regarding whether humans would address the problem.</p>
