When combined with another adverse effect, the dramatic loss of biodiversity that even now is threatening the world&#8217;s food and water supply, it is clear that we are facing a climate <italic>emergency</italic>. The loss of biodiversity, however, does not stem entirely or even primarily from the effects of climate change but is in many ways the result of human actions. In fact, the data reveal that it is anthropogenic activity more than anything else that has triggered the present extinction crisis, impacting both fauna and flora, including vertebrate populations, and leading scientists to the extraordinary conclusion that what we are witnessing is nothing short of &#8220;biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction&#8221; (Ceballos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). It should not come as a surprise that the &#8220;ultimate drivers&#8221; of the biotic destruction, according to the landmark study published in the renowned journal <italic>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</italic>, are &#8220;human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich&#8221; (Ceballos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>).</p>
