<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We argue that the medical profession must adopt a broader conception of health and its determinants, or a &#8216;social lens&#8217;, if it is to move beyond rhetoric to action. Viewing climate change as a clear determinant of mental health opens up potential avenues of action, both as individual clinicians and as a profession as a whole. We offer the beginnings of a framework for action in the context of climate change and youth mental health, before calling for our profession to be courageous enough to re-examine its role and its very purpose to better address the climate crisis.</p>
