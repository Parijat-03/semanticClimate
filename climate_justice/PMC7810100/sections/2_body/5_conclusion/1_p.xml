The country is presently in an era with conditions very similar to that which preceded the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">n.d.</xref>), creating our current system. The economy is undergoing a significant change, from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base. Income inequality is reaching heights not seen since the years immediately preceding the Great Depression (Sommeiller and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>).

Similar conditions led to the creation of the current system, and the establishment of the labor movement as an institution in the United States.</p>
