Vegetation growth (NPP) changes slowly compared to rainfall variations and may be sensitive to rainfall over extended periods (years), depending on vegetation type. Detection of lags and the use of weighted antecedent rainfall can partially address this problem, though most studies do not do this. The method addresses changes since the start of the time series; it cannot identify whether an area is already degraded at the start time. It is assumed that climate, particularly rainfall, is a&#160;principal factor in vegetation change which may not be true in more humid regions.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.27" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="579.54" x1="307.27">Another assumption in RESTREND is that any trend is linear throughout the period examined. That is, there are no discontinuities (break points) in the trend. Browning et al. (2017) have shown that break points in NDVI time series re&#64258;ect vegetation changes based on long-term &#64257;eld sites. To overcome this limitation, Burrell et al. (2017) introduced the Time Series Segmentation-RESTREND (TSS-RESTREND) which allows a&#160;breakpoint or turning point within the period examined (Figure&#160;3.7). Using TSS-RESTREND over Australia they identi&#64257;ed more than double the degrading area than could be identi&#64257;ed with a&#160;standard RESTREND analysis. The occurrence and drivers of abrupt change (turning points) in ecosystem functioning were also examined by Horion et al. (2016) over the semi-arid Northern Eurasian agricultural frontier. They combined trend shifts in RUE, &#64257;eld data and expert knowledge,&#160;to map environmental hotspots of change and attribute them to climate and human activities. One-third of the area showed signi&#64257;cant change in RUE, mainly occurring around the fall of the Soviet Union (1991) or as the result of major droughts. Recent human-induced turning points in ecosystem functioning were uncovered around Volgograd (Russia) and around Lake Balkhash (Kazakhstan), attributed to recultivation, increased salinisation, and increased grazing.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="315.57"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.7; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="315.57" x1="307.29">Attribution of vegetation changes to human activity has also been done within modelling frameworks. In these methods ecosystem models are used to simulate potential natural vegetation dynamics, and this is compared to the observed state. The difference is attributed to human activities. Applied to the Sahel region during the period of 1982&#8211;2002, it showed that people had a&#160;minor in&#64258;uence on vegetation changes (Seaquist et al. 2009).

Similarly, Funk et al.

For example, two-thirds of the observed expansion of the Sahara Desert from 1920&#8211;2003 has been attributed to natural climate cycles (the cold phase of Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation and Paci&#64257;c Decadal Oscillation) (Thomas and Nigam 2018). Some studies consider drought to be the main driver of deserti&#64257;cation in Africa (e.g.,&#160;Masih et al. 2014). However, other studies suggest that although droughts may contribute to deserti&#64257;cation, the underlying causes are human activities (Kouba et al. 2018). Brandt et al. (2016a) found that woody vegetation trends are negatively correlated with human population density. Changes in land use, water pumping and &#64258;ow diversion have enhanced drying of wetlands and salinisation of freshwater aquifers in Israel (Inbar 2007). The dryland territory of China has been found to be very sensitive to both climatic variations and land-use/land-cover changes (Fu et al. 2000; Liu and Tian 2010; Zhao et al. 2013, 2006). Feng et al. (2015) shows that socio-economic factors were dominant in causing deserti&#64257;cation in north Shanxi, China, between 1983 and 2012, accounting for about 80% of deserti&#64257;cation expansion. Successful grass establishment has been impeded by overgrazing and nutrient depletion leading to the encroachment of shrubs into the northern Chihuahuan Desert (USA) since the mid-19th century (Kidron and Gutschick 2017). Human activities led to rangeland degradation in Pakistan and Mongolia during 2000&#8211;2011 (Lei et al. 2011). More equal shares of climatic (temperature and precipitation trends) and human factors were attributed for changes in rangeland condition in China (Yang et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.82" top="243.58"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 321.98; y0: 243.58; y1: 253.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="243.58" x1="565.82">This kaleidoscope of local case studies demonstrates how attribution of deserti&#64257;cation is still challenging for several reasons. Firstly, deserti&#64257;cation is caused by an interaction of different drivers which vary in space and time. Secondly, in drylands, vegetation reacts closely to changes in rainfall so the effect of rainfall changes on biomass needs to be &#8216;removed&#8217; before attributing deserti&#64257;cation to human activities. Thirdly, human activities and climatic drivers impact vegetation/ecosystem changes at different rates. Finally, deserti&#64257;cation manifests as a&#160;gradual change in ecosystem composition and structure (e.g.,&#160;woody shrub invasion into grasslands). Although initiated at a&#160;limited location, ecosystem change may propagate throughout an extensive area via a&#160;series of feedback mechanisms. This complicates the attribution of deserti&#64257;cation to human and climatic causes, as the process can develop independently once started.</span></div></body></html>
