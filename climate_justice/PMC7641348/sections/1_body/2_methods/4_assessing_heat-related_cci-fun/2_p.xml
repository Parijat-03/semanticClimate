They spanned multiple programs such as the Low Income Weatherization, Urban Greening, and Community Air Grants programs. Because of the difficulty in selecting a single metric on which to measure intervention scope, we instead examined the number of heat-related tract interventions. First, we measured how the state of California has distributed all CCI-funded tract interventions and heat-specific tract interventions across communities based on their compound vulnerability scores. This was compared to the percent of tracts in the state that are vulnerable under any of the indices studied. Second, we analyzed how the tract interventions were allocated based on vulnerability indices. Third, we analyzed how the implementation of AB 1550 impacted delegation of heat-related CCI-funded tract interventions, seeking to understand the influence of the state&#8217;s new approach for equity-oriented climate adaptation. Projects in 2015 and 2016 occurred before the passage of AB 1550 and projects in 2017, 2018, and 2019 happened after. Data on a tract&#8217;s designation as low income under AB 1550 were downloaded from the California Air Resources Board website [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
