Science communication can take a diverse range of forms, from documentary films and informational flyers to stand-up comedy, even (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">Bowater and Yeoman 2012</xref>), and its practitioners are increasingly being referred to as &#8220;knowledge brokers&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_051" ref-type="bibr">Meyer 2010</xref>; cf. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_062" ref-type="bibr">Pielke 2007</xref>) or &#8220;knowledge translators&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">Bielak et&#160;al. 2008</xref>) in an effort to emphasize the co-creative and dialogic nature of good science communication.

This requires first doing empirical research to understand what laypersons already know, as well as recognizing that communication about science &#8220;does not occur in a vacuum&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">Fischhoff and Scheufele 2013</xref>: 1); science communication is, in itself, a form of political communication (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_073" ref-type="bibr">Scheufele 2014</xref>).</p>
