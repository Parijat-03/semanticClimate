Most previous studies on environmental activism were not specifically about climate change. The climate crisis is different from other environmental issues such as plastic waste and local industrial pollution. The climate concern requires acting on a threat that is often invisible, gradual, and long-term [<xref rid="RSOS210006C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS210006C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also global in the sense that local actions are only ultimately effective in concert with massive changes elsewhere. The climate threat is also unusual in that it is so widely distributed as to almost defy comprehension: it is leading to cascading problems across such diverse areas as agriculture and biodiversity, socio-political stability and human health [<xref rid="RSOS210006C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These features indicate unique barriers to participation in climate action, which may require studies specifically on climate activism.</p>
