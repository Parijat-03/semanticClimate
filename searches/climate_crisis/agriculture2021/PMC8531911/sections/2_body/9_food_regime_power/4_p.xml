Pertinent to this effort, the Gates Foundation recently formed a new Agricultural Innovations initiative, called &#8216;Gates Ag One,&#8217; with the goal of bringing &#8216;climate-smart&#8217; scientific breakthroughs to smallholder farmers via &#8216;the affordable, high-quality tools, technologies, and resources they need to lift themselves out of poverty.&#8217; And this is in context of considering consolidation of all 15 CGIAR Centers into a single center, co-chaired by the Senior Program Officer of the Gates Foundation, which would blur the &#8216;lines between the private and public sectors,&#8217; and fulfill the Gates Foundation&#8217;s website claim: &#8216;a key trigger of agricultural transformation is a conducive policy environment&#8217; (Navdanya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>: 67, 70).</p>
