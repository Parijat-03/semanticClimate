Demographic covariates were selected based on prior research showing their associations with climate change anxiety, environmental activism, or MDD and GAD symptoms (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Age was included as a continuous variable. Gender identity was a three-level categorical variable (man; woman; transgender, non-binary, or other). Given the small number in the latter category (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6), this was dichotomized into male&#8201;=&#8201;1, all others&#8201;=&#8201;0, based on prior research showing those who identify as women, transgender, non-binary, and other gender reporting significantly higher MDD and GAD symptoms than those who identify as men (Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>; Reisner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). Participants reported their race using a single item allowing for multiple responses. The following dummy codes were then derived: White; Black; Asian; Latinx or Hispanic; and Other (including Native American/Alaska Native, Middle Eastern/North African, Multiracial, and &#8220;not listed&#8221;). Although these categories were not mutually exclusive, White was used as a reference group to facilitate model convergence. Dummy codes were also included for whether the participant was a financial aid recipient; a first-generation college student; born in the United States; and a graduate (versus undergraduate) student.</p>
