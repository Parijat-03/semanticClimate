The evaluation of regional climate 8 models REMO and ALARO-0 driven by ERA-Interim at 25 km resolution over the domain CORDEX-CA 9 showed that the choice of the observational dataset has an impact on the scores but in general both models 10 reproduce reasonably well the spatio-temporal patterns for temperature and precipitation (Top et al., 11 submitted). The evaluation of minimum and maximum temperature demonstrates that both models 12 underestimate the daily temperature range. The evaluation of regional climate model RegCM3 for the winter 13 climate of Central Southwest Asia, focusing on the mean model climatology of temperature and 14 precipitation, showed that the model driven by ERA40 reanalysis dataset can reproduce well the climatology 15 of temperature, precipitation and storms over the region. (Syed et al., 2010) also found that RegCM3 16 captures the observed influence of NAO and ENSO on climate, particularly in the region of northern 17 Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kazakhstan. 18 19 According to results based on implementation of the high-resolution regional climate model REMO driven 20 by the ECHAM dataset over the region centred over Central Asia, the simulated large-scale precipitation and 21 temperature patterns are in good agreement with observations. Results show that in the high altitudes of the 22 mountainous regions of the study area, REMO simulates colder temperatures than observed but the pattern of 23 simulated precipitation is quite close to observations thanks to the higher resolution of the regional model. 24 Nevertheless, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of regional climate models, because the model 25 simulations have a higher resolution than the observational data and station coverage is low. Those stations 26 which exist are usually situated in valleys and not at the high elevations (Mannig et al., 2013).

According to the study, this result can be explained by 32 inadequate observational data due to a lack of climatological and meteorological stations in that region of the 33 domain.
