<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0110">I approach courtroom ethnography here as a way of re-imagining contested proceedings, jurisdictional assertions, positionalities and embodied practices. It is, in part, a way of <italic>unsettling</italic> (see <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">De Leeuw &amp; Hunt, 2018</xref>) knowledge production in relation to machine-like prosecutorial efforts at categorising and individualising illegality and punishing acts of conscience with colonial law; partly it is about contrasting these moves with the courageous stances of defendants, the collective mobilisation and the ethics of care displayed amid contested regimes of extractivism. As I learned through more than a hundred and fifty hours of attending court proceedings that at times dragged on for hours of judicial jargon, prosecutors often snowed defendants with their version of legal precedents and case law, narrowly circumscribing spaces for defendants to articulate their concerns. Constricted space for &#8216;evidence&#8217; was central to a system of guaranteeing guilty verdicts and punishment. The injunction here served &#8211; like injunctions elsewhere &#8211; &#8220;as a blunt instrument in opposition to Indigenous law&#8221; (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Pasternak &amp; King, 2019</xref>, p. 29) with proceedings structured to confirm what a judge knew already: that many people stood or sat (or prayed) on a road. Courtroom ethnography became a way of exploring a system mobilised to subordinate Indigenous rights and voices to procedural discussions, using vast state resources in the service of oil industry expansion; it also became a process of researcher interactions with people in the court corridors and beyond, where not only issues of this court were explored but also other struggles (beyond this injunction), situated knowledges, and intersecting solidary efforts.</p>
