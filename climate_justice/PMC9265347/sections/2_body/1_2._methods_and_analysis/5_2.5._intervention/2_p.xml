Although initially targeted at university students, the PCS was first implemented in November 2020 in primary and secondary schools using tailored content and materials. The PCS is rooted in ESD with its principles of forward thinking, interdisciplinary knowledge, autonomous action and participation in social decision-making processes [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the PCS is guided by the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Prior to its first implementation in November 2020, one lesson was pretested with one class to test technical and on-site procedures at the school. No changes were made to content or delivery after the pretest. Since this time, the content and delivery of the PCS has been constantly refined based on field reports and reflection meetings of the implementation team. </p>
