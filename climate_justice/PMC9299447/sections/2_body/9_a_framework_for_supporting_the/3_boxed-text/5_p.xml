<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It does not help us when there is judgement of young activists. It is seen as uncool to care. We find it hard when other people do not understand or do not care about climate change. At the same time, it makes us angry when people acknowledge the issue and do nothing about it. Sometimes we play it down when promoting action on climate change because we do not want to get a bad reputation. Everyone should be taking climate change very seriously, but we need to balance this &#8211; we want to be effective and not lose social collateral. Our society also needs to be open to young people making mistakes, and we need to move away from the judgement of &#8216;purity culture&#8217;. It is not helpful to reprimand youth climate activists for little things like using a takeaway coffee cup. We're already juggling a lot &#8211; being young, living through climate change and being a climate activist. It also does not help us when people who do not know what they are talking about try to tell us what is happening and make fun of us for it. Youth climate activists are doing what is expected at this time in history, and we need everyone to normalise caring about the environment, and not make it a gimmicky personality trait.</p>
