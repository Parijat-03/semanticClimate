Within Asia, behavioural drivers of adaptation decision making have been studied primarily in agriculture (in South, East and Southeast Asia) and disaster risk management (from Southeast and East Asia) (Table&#160;10.4) and tend to focus on technical adaptation interventions rather than how and why people adapt (Sun and Han, 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.26" top="546.62"><span x0="42.52" y0="546.62" x1="296.26" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In agriculture, studies demonstrate how perceptions of risk (e.g., climate variability) (Singh et&#160;al., 2016; Zheng and Dallimer, 2016; Burnham and Ma, 2017; Feng et&#160;al., 2017), sociocultural norms and personal experiences (Masud, 2016; Nguyen et&#160;al., 2016; Singh et&#160;al., 2016), and perceived efficacy of adaptation interventions in having a positive and desirable impact (Halbrendt et&#160;al., 2014; Truelove et&#160;al., 2015; Feng et&#160;al., 2017), affect adaptation decisions.

Individual risk management is nested within public policies, such as those on flood management, which shape individual flood risk perception and protective behaviours (Reynaud et&#160;al., 2013) as well as personal factors such as religious beliefs (Alshehri et&#160;al., 2013). For example, communities often perceive disasters as &#8216;acts of God&#8217; (Birkmann et&#160;al., 2019) or punishment for wrongdoings (Alshehri et&#160;al., 2013; Iqbal et&#160;al., 2018), which might constrain adaptive action. However, religious faith can also motivate people to prepare for extreme events, as Alshehri et&#160;al. (2013) showed in Saudi Arabia demonstrating how &#8216;Islam urges that it is most important to prepare the people to escape from disaster&#8217; (p.1825).</span></div><div left="42.53" right="296.2" top="198.63"><span x0="42.53" y0="198.63" x1="296.2" style="x0: 42.53; x1: 46.74; y0: 198.63; y1: 208.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Trust in public action as a mediator of risk management has had conflicting evidence: some studies have discussed trust as being critical to effective preparedness (Kittipongvises and Mino, 2015; Walch, 2018), while others have found that trust in public actions, such as structural interventions to mitigate flood impacts, can lower individual motivations to act since they feel protected (Hung et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="559.85" top="94.27"><span x0="42.52" y0="94.27" x1="559.85" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 45.89; y0: 94.27; y1: 101.27; width: 3.37; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: BGTYRB+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">12 Two exceptions to this were found. One is a survey in Saudi Arabia which tested public perceptions of disaster risk and found that direct experience with such disasters does not directly influence risk perception (Alshehri et&#160;al., 2013). Second, a study on flood experience and ensuing adaptation behaviour in Pakistan found that those with prior flood experience do not make significantly different choices than those who have no experience of flooding.

Others, however, highlight that higher risk perception can lead to a normalisation of risks, leading to lower climate action (Lu&#237;s et&#160;al., 2018). In all of these papers, there is a recognition that the literature on perceptual drivers of climate action is USA-centric and is negligible in Asia (Capstick et&#160;al. 2015).</span></div><div left="306.71" right="560.41" top="714.6"><span x0="306.71" y0="714.6" x1="560.41" style="x0: 306.71; x1: 311.28; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">decision making (Le Dang et&#160;al., 2014; Singh et&#160;al., 2016; Khanal et&#160;al., 2018; Liu et&#160;al., 2018a) with those believing in climate change and associated impacts tending to engage in adaptation. Crucially, those who do not believe in climate change can be influenced by social norms (Arunrat et&#160;al., 2017) thereby incentivising adaptation behaviour. While risk perception is a critical step in adaptation decision making, higher risk perception does not necessarily signal better capacity to cope: in Taiwan, Province of China, Sun and Han (2018) highlight how perceptions of climate risk as a global problem tends reduce its urgency as an individual issue. Providing information on climate risks, impacts and possible adaptation options enables adaptation behaviour (Piya et&#160;al., 2013; Zheng and Dallimer, 2016; Rauf et&#160;al., 2017), but information alone is not sufficient to motivate adaptive behaviour. Specifically, awareness building on concrete measures and outcomes, such as the amount of water saved or number of deaths averted, rather than abstract notions of climate change, motivate adaptation (Deng et&#160;al., 2017; Rauf et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="306.71" right="410.81" top="498.48"><span x0="306.71" y0="498.48" x1="410.81" style="x0: 306.71; x1: 311.51; y0: 498.48; y1: 508.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.3.3 Lifestyle changes</span></div><div left="306.71" right="560.42" top="474.6"><span x0="306.71" y0="474.6" x1="560.42" style="x0: 306.71; x1: 311.81; y0: 474.6; y1: 484.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Changes in current lifestyles and consumption patterns are acknowledged as critical to climate action (de Coninck et&#160;al., 2018; IGES, 2019).
