      <td>In developing countries, flood jeopardises primary access to food and impacts on livelihoods. In Bangladesh, the 2007 flood reduced\naverage consumption by 103Kcal/cap/day (worsening the existing 19.4% calories deficit), and in Pakistan, the 2010 flood resulted in\na loss of 205 Kcal/cap/day (or 8.5% of the Pakistan average food supply). The 2010 flood affected more than 4.5 million workers, two-\nthirds employed in agriculture; and 79% of farms lost greater than one-half of their expected income (Pacetti et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>Policy instruments and responses react to the sequential and cascading impacts of flood. In a Malawi study, flood impacts\ncascaded through labour, trade and transfer systems. First a harvest failure occurred, followed by the decline of employment\nopportunities and reduction in real wages, followed by a market failure or decline in trade, ultimately followed by a failure in informal\nsafety nets (Devereux 2007). Planned policy responses include those that address the sequential nature of the cascading impacts,\nstarting with &#8216;productivity-enhancing safety nets&#8217; addressing harvest failure, then public works programmes addressing the decline in\nemployment opportunities, followed by food price subsidies to address the market failure, and finally food aid to address the failure\nof informal safety nets (Devereux 2007). In another example in East Africa&#8217;s range lands, flood halted livestock sales, food prices\nfell, and grain production ceased. Local food shortages couldn&#8217;t be supplemented with imports due to destruction of transport links,\nand pastoral incomes were inadequate to purchase food. Livestock diseases became rampant and eventually food shortages led to\nescalating prices. Due to the contextual nature and timing of events, policy responses initially addressed mobility and resource access,\nand eventually longer-term issues such as livestock disease (Little et al. 2001).</td>

      <td>In North America, floods are often described in terms of costs. For instance, the 1997 Red River Basin flood cost Manitoba, Canada\n1 billion USD and the USA 4 billion USD in terms of impact on agriculture and food production (Adaptation to Climate Change Team\n2013). In Canada, floods accounted for 82% of disaster financial assistance spent from 2005&#8211;2014 (Public Safety Canada 2017)\nand this cost may increase in the future. Future climate change may result in a 2 meter in sea level by 2100, costing from 507 to\n882 billion USD, affecting 300 American cities (losing one-half of their homes) and the wholesale loss of 36 cities (Lemann 2018).</td>

      <td>Policy measures are important as an increasingly warming world may make post-disaster assistance and insurance increasingly\nunaffordable (Surminski et al. 2016). Historic legal mechanisms for retreating from low-lying and coastal areas have failed to\nencourage relocation of people out of flood plains and areas of high risk (Stoa 2015). In some places, cheap flood insurance and\nmassive aid programmes have encouraged the populating of low-lying flood-prone and coastal areas (Lemann 2018). Although\nthe state makes disaster assistance payments, it is local governments that determine vulnerability through flood zone mapping,\nrestrictions from building in flood zones, building requirements (Stoa 2015), and integrated planning for flood. A comprehensive policy\nmix (Section 7.4.8) (implemented through adaptive management as illustrated in Figure 7.6) reduces vulnerability (Hurlbert 2018a,b).\nPolicy mixes that allow people to respond to disasters include bankruptcy, insolvency rules, house protected from creditors, income\nminimums, and basic agricultural implement protection laws. The portfolio of policies allows people to recover and, if necessary,\nmigrate to other areas and occupations (Hurlbert 2018b).</td>

      <td>At the international level, reactionary disaster response has evolved to proactive risk management that combines adaptation\nand mitigation responses to ensure effective risk response, build resilient systems and solve issues of structural social inequality\n(Innocenti and Albrito 2011). Advanced measures of preparedness are the main instruments to reduce fatalities and limit damage,\nas illustrated in Figure 7.8. The Sendai Declaration (Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015&#8211;2030), is an action plan to\nreduce mortality, the number of affected people and economic losses, using four priorities: understanding disaster risk; strengthening\nits governance to enhance the ability to manage disaster risk; investing in resilience; and enhancing disaster preparedness. There is\nmedium evidence and high agreement that the Sendai Declaration significantly refers to adaptive governance and could be a window\nof opportunity to transform disaster risk reduction to address the causes of vulnerability (Munene et al. 2018). Addressing disasters\nincreasingly requires individual, household, community and national planning and commitment to a new path of resilience and\nshared responsibility through whole community engagement and linking private and public infrastructure interests (Rouillard et al.\n2013). It is recommended that a vision and overarching framework of governance be adopted to allow participation and coordination\nby government, NGOs, researchers and the private sector, individuals in the neighbourhood community. Disaster risk response is\nenhanced with complementary structural and non-structural measures, implemented together with measurable scorecard indicators\n(Chen 2011).</td>
