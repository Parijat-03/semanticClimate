As estimates of sample size based on feasibly sized pilot studies for cluster-randomised studies tend to be biased downwards [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], we will combine results of the pilot study with external evidence including published lists of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and general considerations on patterns of ICCs, to guide estimates for sample size and recruitment and retention rates for the main trial, as suggested in the literature [<xref rid="B67-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Preliminary estimates of parameters and ICCs from the pilot study may themselves feed into sample size estimations of similar school-based programmes in Germany and internationally. </p>
