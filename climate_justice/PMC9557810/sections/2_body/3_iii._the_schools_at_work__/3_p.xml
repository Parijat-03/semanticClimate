<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We now turn to the five verbs that encapsulate the core pedagogic practices
identified by the participating schools as crucial means to foster the articulation
of <italic toggle="yes">saberes</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">haceres</italic> underpinning popular
urbanism. While not all these verbs are present equally across all schools, they
resonated strongly with every participant, as critical practices with profound
potential for activating and sustaining change. We explore each verb starting with a
vignette from a sequence of the films produced by the schools, followed by a
discussion of what each critical pedagogic practice involves in developing key
capacities to tackle urban inequality.</p>
