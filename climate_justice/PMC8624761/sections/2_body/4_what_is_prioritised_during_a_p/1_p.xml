With successive waves of infections, governments have ordered or extended lockdowns, despite concerns about economic consequences. Strong public health measures are often framed as prioritising public health over economic considerations.Conversely, postponing lockdown measures is framed as &#8220;saving the economy&#8221; or &#8220;saving livelihoods,&#8221; which comes at the cost of public health or &#8220;saving lives.&#8221;<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This is possibly the most discussed dichotomy, with authors agreeing that public health measures need to be supported by strong social welfare nets and balanced with economic and financial support. As governments start to view covid-19 as an endemic infectious hazard, this debate gains new traction.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Policies to navigate this transition should secure the integration of public health measures, vaccinations, and socioeconomic support to shield populations, especially vulnerable ones, from the disparate and detrimental effects of covid-19.</p>
