In a landmark 2019 United Nations report on the effects of sea level rise, scholars praised public participation as a &#8220;decision tool&#8221; to reduce the polarizing effect of top-down new infrastructure projects in urban settings (Oppenheimer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>). The result, in theory, would be to &#8220;successfully include vulnerable groups in adaptation processes, promote justice, and enable transformative change&#8221; (Oppenheimer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>). On the other hand, since the 1970&#8217;s, so-called &#8220;eco-authoritarians&#8221; have argued that &#8220;some aspects of democratic rule would have to be sacrificed in order to achieve sustainable future outcomes,&#8221; (Held &amp; Hervey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>) and have called modern democracy an impediment to dealing with climate change, since authoritarian regimes do not need to be attentive to citizen input to impose policies in key technical areas such as climate change (Heilbroner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1974</xref>; Ophuls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1977</xref>).</p>
