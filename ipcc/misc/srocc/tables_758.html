      <td>Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) can play a key role in climate change adaptation (high confidence) (Mapfumo et al. 2017;\nNyong et al. 2007; Green and Raygorodetsky 2010; Speranza et al. 2010; Alexander et al. 2011; Leonard et al. 2013; Nakashima et al.\n2013; Tschakert 2007). The Summary for Policymakers of the Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014b, p. 26) states that &#8216;Indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and\npractices, including indigenous peoples&#8217; holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate\nchange, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing\npractices increases the effectiveness of adaptation&#8217; (see also Ford et al. 2016). The IPCC&#8217;s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C\n(SR15) (IPCC 2018a; de Coninck et al. 2018) confirms the effectiveness and potential feasibility of adaptation options based on ILK,\nbut also raises concerns that such knowledge systems are being threatened by multiple socio-economic and environmental drivers\n(high confidence). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Land Degradation\nand Restoration Assessment (IPBES 2018) finds the same &#8211; that ILK can support adaptation to land degradation, but is threatened.</td>

      <td>A variety of terminology has been used to describe ILK: indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, traditional knowledge,\ntraditional ecological knowledge, and other terms are used in overlapping and often inconsistent ways (Naess 2013). SR15 (IPCC\n2018a) reserves &#8216;indigenous knowledge&#8217; for culturally distinctive ways of knowing associated with &#8216;societies with long histories of\ninteraction with their natural surroundings&#8217;, while using &#8216;local knowledge&#8217; for &#8216;understandings and skills developed by individuals and\npopulations, specific to the places where they live&#8217;, but not all research studies observe this distinction. This Special Report generally\nuses ILK as a combined term for these forms of knowledge, but in some sections the terminology used follows that from the research\nliterature assessed.</td>

      <td>In contrast to scientific knowledge, ILK is context-specific, collective, transmitted informally, and is multi-functional (Mistry and Berardi\n2016; Naess 2013; Janif et al. 2016). Persson et al. (2018) characterise ILK as &#8216;practical experience&#8217;, as locally held knowledges are\nacquired through processes of experience and interaction with the surrounding physical world. ILK is embedded in local institutions\n(Naess 2013) and in cultural aspects of landscape and food systems (Fuller and Qingwen 2013; Koohafkan and Altieri 2011). ILK\ncan encompass such diverse content as factual information about the environment, guidance on rights and management, value\nstatements about interactions with others, and cosmologies and worldviews that influence how information is perceived and acted\non, among other topics (Spoon 2014; Usher 2000).</td>

At both global level (Alexander et al. 2011; Green and\nRaygorodetsky 2010), and local level (Speranza et al. 2010; Ayanlade et al. 2017), strong correlations between local perceptions of\nclimate change and meteorological data have been shown, as calendars, almanacs, and other seasonal and interannual systems\nknowledge embedded in ILK hold information about environmental baselines (Orlove et al. 2010; Cochran et al. 2016).</td>
