Due to the fact that some NDCs do not have clearly identifiable mitigation objectives, estimates from three external sources are taken into account (CAT; Climate &amp; Energy College; UNEP) in addition to the authors&#8217; estimate. The expected emissions level, according to each source, can be observed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
