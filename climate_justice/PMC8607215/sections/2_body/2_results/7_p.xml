When one&#8217;s temperature exceeds the threshold, all heat generated by the body must be dispelled through sweating. As a consequence, high humidity or excessive heat may result in slow air movement over the skin&#8217;s surface which could greatly inhibit the body&#8217;s cooling mechanism through sweating. The extremely hot climate has been perceived as impacting the psychological conditions of the young, increasing their vulnerability to violence, aggression, and irritability. Jointly, the (in)direct effect of climate change poses grave health risks for young people, which might span from depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, sleep disorders, and in an extreme case, suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The health condition is further punctuated by fatigue, visual disturbances, tiredness, and dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Prolonged dehydration without replacement of the body fluid (through water intake) could lead to extreme medical conditions such as renal kidney, chronic kidney, heatstroke, and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
