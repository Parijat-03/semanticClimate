Another perspective to access to education is that it is a problem we have failed to properly address in the past. It manifested in the ease at which the populace accepted and spread misinformation. This militated efforts in curtailing the disease across the country. Therefore, the shortcoming in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and awareness became obvious. Many Nigerians were quick to accept falsehoods. This could be partially attributed to the lack of access to information (poor access to the internet), poor critical thinking skills (that could be gained through knowledge of the scientific method), poor public education campaigns by the appropriate authorities and potential lack of trust in the authorities (Adebisi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). Addressing the climate change issue requires the participation of an educated and knowledgeable citizenry. Failure in educating the populace adequately will likely result in a lack of understanding of the challenges, a lack of acceptance of innovations and policies to mitigate impacts, an increase in support for quick fixes and little or no buy-ins for long-term policies.</p>
