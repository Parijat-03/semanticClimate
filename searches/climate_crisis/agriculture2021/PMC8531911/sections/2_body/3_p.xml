This clears the way to ignore four decades of state privatization to enable &#8216;corporate advantage,&#8217; privileging transnational capitalism at the expense of national sovereignty and regulatory efficacy. In effect, states were repositioned to sign on to the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules premised on a governing principle of states serving markets&#8212;to be consummated in &#8216;corporate capture&#8217; via the UNFSS.</p>
