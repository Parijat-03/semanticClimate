At the time of the ESCR controversy, many of the same activists resisting the project were also involved in mobilizing against the approval and construction of supertall luxury housing buildings in Two Bridges, a small pocket on the southern end of the Lower East Side. Throughout 2019 and 2020, protesters gathered in the shade of brand new glass and steel residential towers to voice their discontent at the dwindling availability of affordable housing in the neighborhood, especially for long-time residents of nearby Chinatown (Ngu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2019</xref>). Yet the fight against luxury housing in Two Bridges was only the most recent land development concern for activists. Many people involved in neighborhood politics have been scarred by their involvement in the planning for Essex Crossing on the north end of the LES &#8211; a four decade-long struggle among community groups, city agencies, and real estate developers to produce a mixed-use mega-development balancing affordable units with high-end apartments and businesses (Kimmelman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>). A simmering suspicion of the city&#8217;s long-term re-zoning strategy, which advocacy groups claim will further tighten a perilously small supply of affordable supply in neighborhoods such as East Harlem and Sunset Park, also fueled activists&#8217; distrust of city officials.</p>
