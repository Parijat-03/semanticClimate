<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0315">The assessment of project outcomes has become a recurring requirement for all microfinance programmes (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ferraro et&#160;al., 2020</xref>). The role of sustainability, CSR, ethics, vulnerability and resilience are nowadays central in both finance practice and research (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Salerno, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Gangi et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et&#160;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Jeucken, 2004</xref>). This happened especially in the aftermath of the financial crises (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Gatto and Sadik-Zada, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Busato and Gatto, 2019</xref>). Finance has gradually approached topics of social and environmental relevance &#8211; and microfinance and new financial tools have trailblased this process (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#160;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Purdon, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allet and Hudon, 2015</xref>), where access to finance has been signalled as a development priority (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Beck and Demirg&#252;&#231;-Kunt, 2008</xref>). However, additional attention is required and the gap between research, business, policymaking and practice still needs to be bridged (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho Ferreira et&#160;al., 2016</xref>).</p>
