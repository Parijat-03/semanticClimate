Around 1 lakh 36 thousand conventional street lights have already been changed to energy efficient LED lights in South Delhi Municipal Corporation area. EE &amp; REM is pursuing with other Municipal bodies &amp; PWD for replacing conventional street lights to energy efficient LED lights in their respective areas. This will lead to saving of electricity along with shaving of peak power demand.</span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.23" top="617.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="617.43" x1="508.23" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 617.43; y1: 629.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">EE &amp; REM, Department of Power, GNCTD and United States Embassy, New Delhi agreed to have a common programme to promote the deployment of clean energy technologies (renewable energy and energy efficient technologies) to enhance energy security, improve access to energy, conserve energy and promote clean energy development.

Designated Consumers are obligated to improve energy efficiency &amp; under this scheme a target is given to every DC. Target under PAT scheme is defined as the % reduction of &#8216;Specific Energy Consumption (SEC)&#8217; from Baseline value. Under PAT-I there are four Designated Consumers in Delhi namely Badarpur Thermal Power Station (BTPS), Rajghat Thermal Power Station (RTPS), Gas Turbine Power Station (GTPS) and Pragati Power Station. EE&amp;REM Centre has successfully completed the monitoring and verification (M&amp;V) of all DCs under PAT-I Cycle. Three new sectors have been added as DCs namely, Refineries, Railways, DISCOMS under PAT Cycle II. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.33" top="248.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="248.23" x1="508.33" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 248.23; y1: 260.23; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Total Renewable Energy (Solar + Waste-to-Energy) installed capacity in the State of Delhi as on April&#8217;2018 = 140.86 MW (88.86 MW from Solar + 52 MW from WTE plants). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="353.11" top="198.31"><span x0="72.02" y0="198.31" x1="353.11" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 198.31; y1: 210.31; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">9.4Institutions Involved in Energy &amp; Power sector </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="171.34"><span x0="86.18" y0="171.34" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 171.34; y1: 180.34; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="170.59" x1="296.57" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 109.0; y0: 170.59; y1: 182.59; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="155.5"><span x0="86.18" y0="155.5" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 155.5; y1: 164.5; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="154.75" x1="353.11" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 109.0; y0: 154.75; y1: 166.75; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Northern Regional Load Dispatch Centre (NRLDC) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="139.66"><span x0="86.18" y0="139.66" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 139.66; y1: 148.66; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="138.91" x1="294.65" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 111.01; y0: 138.91; y1: 150.91; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Ministry of Power, Govt. of India (GoI) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="123.81"><span x0="86.18" y0="123.81" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 123.81; y1: 132.81; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="123.07" x1="259.01" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 109.0; y0: 123.07; y1: 135.07; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Department of Power (GNCTD) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="107.86"><span x0="86.18" y0="107.86" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 107.86; y1: 116.86; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="107.11" x1="276.41" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 108.34; y0: 107.11; y1: 119.11; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Central Electricity Authority (CEA) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="92.0"><span x0="86.18" y0="92.0" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 92.0; y1: 101.0; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="91.25" x1="354.07" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 108.34; y0: 91.25; y1: 103.25; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) </span></div><div left="86.18" right="95.41" top="76.16"><span x0="86.18" y0="76.16" x1="95.41" style="x0: 86.18; x1: 92.91; y0: 76.16; y1: 85.16; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Wingdings;">&#61548; </span><span x0="100.34" y0="75.41" x1="346.03" style="x0: 100.34; x1: 109.0; y0: 75.41; y1: 87.41; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) </span></div></body></html>
