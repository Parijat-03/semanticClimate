<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The top 18 users based on retweet network were (alphabetical order): chrltmrshl, CarlosdelRio7, DocWoc71, DrJRMarcelin, Dr_Mike_Stevens, ErinMcCreary, FranciscoMarty_, GermHunterMD, IDSAInfo, IDWeek2020, JGPharmD, PIDSociety, SAIRABT, SaraKellerMD1, SIDPharm, SPInfectologia, SteveRustad1, and Vaccinologist. As visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, thousands of darker weighted magenta lines (edges) can be seen connecting from a peripheral node to 1 of these top 18 labeled nodes, indicating increased retweet mentions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> demonstrates the interactions of 2 of these user accounts (CarlosdelRio7 and GermHunterMD) with other users, representing a total of 464 nodes (users) and 1406 edges (connections). The darker and thicker pink lines converge in 5 distinct areas (pulled into the periphery) and demonstrate increased clustering and network activity among those users.</p>
