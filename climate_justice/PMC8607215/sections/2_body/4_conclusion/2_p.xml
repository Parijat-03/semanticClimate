The paper observes that considering the government&#8217;s perceived slow steps towards shifting from coal to renewables, youth (who will bear the brunt of high emissions) ought to submit similar CCL to the local court for consideration. Their application may be underpinned by (i) sections&#160;7 and 24 of the Constitution where the rights of youth to health and sustainable development are, respectively, entrenched; (ii) sections&#160;61 of the CPA which oblige the energy sector to raise awareness of the side-effect of their product.</p>
