For example, in the northern hemisphere the northward expansion of warmer temperatures in the middle and higher latitudes will lengthen the growing season (Gregory and Marshall 2012; Yang et&#160;al. 2015b) which may bene&#64257;t crop productivity (Parry et&#160;al. 2004; Rosenzweig et&#160;al., 2014; Deryng et&#160;al. 2016). However, continued rising temperatures are expected to impact global wheat yields by about 4&#8211;6% reductions for every degree of temperature rise (Liu et&#160;al. 2016a; Asseng et&#160;al. 2015) and across both mid- and low latitude regions, rising temperatures are also expected to be a constraining factor for maize productivity by the end of the century (Bassu et&#160;al. 2014; Zhao et&#160;al. 2017). Although there has been a general reduction in frost occurrence during winter and spring, and a lengthening of the frost free season in response to growing concentrations of GHGs (Fischer and Knutti 2014; Wypych&#160;et&#160;al. 2017), there are regions where the frost season length has increased, for example, in southern Australia (Crimp et&#160;al. 2016). Despite the general reduced frost season length, late spring frosts may increase risk of damage to warming induced precocious vegetation growth and &#64258;owering (Meier et&#160;al. 2018). Observed and projected warmer minimum temperatures have, and will continue to, reduce the number of winter chill units required by temperate fruit and nut trees (Luedeling 2012). Crop yields are impacted negatively by increases of seasonal rainfall variability in the tropics, sub-tropics, water-limited and high elevation environments, while drought severity and growing season temperatures also have a negative impact on crop yield (Nelson et&#160;al. 2009; Schlenker and Lobell 2010; M&#252;ller et&#160;al. 2017; Parry et&#160;al. 2004; Wheeler and Von Braun 2013; Challinor et&#160;al. 2014). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="363.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 363.57; y1: 373.07; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="363.57" x1="313.27">Changes in extreme weather and climate (Section 2.2.5) have negative impacts on food security through regional reductions of crop yields. A recent study shows that 18&#8211;43% of the explained yield variance of four crops (maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat) is attributable to extremes of temperature and rainfall, depending on the crop type (Vogel et&#160;al. 2019). Climate shocks, particularly severe drought impact low-income small-holder producers disproportionately (Vermeulen&#160;et&#160;al. 2012; Rivera Ferre 2014). Extremes also compromise critical food supply chain infrastructure, making transport of and access to  harvested food more dif&#64257;cult (Brown et&#160;al. 2015; Fanzo&#160;et&#160;al.&#160;2018).

Range expansion in higher latitudes and elevations as a result of warming often, but not exclusively, occurs in abandoned lands (Harsch et&#160;al. 2009; Landh&#228;usser et&#160;al. 2010; Gottfried et&#160;al. 2012; Boisvert-Marsh et&#160;al. 2014; Bryn and Potthoff 2018; Rumpf et&#160;al. 2018; Buitenwerf et&#160;al. 2018; Steinbauer et&#160;al. 2018). This expansion typically favours thermophilic species at the expense of cold adapted species as the climate becomes suitable for lower latitude/altitude species (Rumpf et&#160;al. 2018).
