      <td>Governance and\nplanning</td>
      <td>National policy directives to adapt: for example, strong national climate\ncommitments in China, India and Thailand (Dulal, 2019); and dedicated public&#8211;\nprivate councils on climate change in Seoul, Republic of Korea (Lee and Painter,\n2015)\nParticipatory planning, co-producing solutions and engaging multiple\nstakeholders: for example, Surat (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Karanth and Archer,\n2014; Chu et al., 2017) and Guwahati (Archer et al., 2014) in India; Bandar\nLampung and Semarang in Indonesia (Archer et al., 2014); and Seoul, Republic of\nKorea (Lee and Painter, 2015)\nDevolving decision making to city governments (ADB, 2013) and strong political\nleadership helps to institutionalise adaptation programmes (Anguelovski et al.,\n2014; Friend et al., 2014; Lee and Painter, 2015): for example, in Moscow where\nthe city mayor has spearheaded climate action (van der Heijden et al., 2019).\nMainstreaming climate adaptation in city plans (UN-HABITAT and UNESCAP,\n2018)</td>
      <td>Low accountability and transparency in planning processes with inadequate\nspaces for public dialogue (Friend et al., 2014) and limited accountability to the\nmost economically and politically marginalised people within cities (Garschagen\nand Marks, 2019)\nOf 180 urban adaptation interventions across Asia, 65% are reactive in nature\n(Dulal, 2019), thus missing opportunities for risk prevention and preparedness\n(Francisco and Zakaria, 2019).\nLack of forward-looking, learning-oriented processes constrain adaptation with\nshort-term development priorities often overshadowing long-term climate-action\nneeds (Friend et al., 2014; de Leon and Pittock, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018; Khaling\net al., 2018; Garschagen and Marks, 2019; Jain et al., 2021).\nFragmented governance, lack of mainstreaming between CCA and DRR (Fuhr\net al., 2018; Khaling et al., 2018): for example, in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia\n(Friend et al., 2014) and greater Manila (Meerow, 2017)</td>
