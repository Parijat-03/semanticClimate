Because SLCFs do not remain in the atmosphere for very long, their effects on the climate are different from one region to another and can change rapidly in response to changes in SLCF emissions. As some SLCFs also negatively affect air quality, measures to improve air quality have resulted in sharp reductions in emissions and concentrations of those SLCFs in many regions over the few last decades.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="304.25" top="574.77"><span x0="74.69" y0="574.77" x1="304.25" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 574.77; y1: 583.77; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The SLCFs include gases as well as tiny particles called </span><span style="x0: 304.63; x1: 309.64; y0: 574.77; y1: 583.77; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="304.63" y0="574.77" x1="338.64">aerosols</span><span x0="338.64" y0="574.77" x1="545.49" style="x0: 338.64; x1: 341.15; y0: 574.77; y1: 583.77; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">, and they can have a&#160;warming or cooling effect on the climate (FAQ 6.1, Figure&#160;1).

SLCFs are emitted both naturally and as a&#160;result of human activities, such as agriculture or extraction of fossil fuels. Many of the human sources, particularly those involving combustion, produce SLCFs at the same time as carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases. Emissions have increased since the start of industrialization, and humans are now the dominant source for several SLCFs and SLCF precursors, such as sulphur dioxide (which produces sulphate aerosols) and nitrogen oxides (which produce nitrate aerosols and ozone), despite strong reductions over the last few decades in some regions due to efforts to improve air quality. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.5" top="406.8"><span x0="74.69" y0="406.8" x1="545.5" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 406.8; y1: 415.8; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The climatic effect of a&#160;chemical compound in the atmosphere depends on two things: (i) how effective it is at cooling or warming the climate (its </span><span style="x0: 252.08; x1: 255.58; y0: 394.81; y1: 403.81; width: 3.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="252.08" y0="394.81" x1="332.49">radiative efficiency</span><span x0="332.49" y0="394.81" x1="545.43" style="x0: 332.49; x1: 335.49; y0: 394.81; y1: 403.81; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">) and (ii) how long it remains in the atmosphere (its&#160;</span><span style="x0: 90.25; x1: 92.76; y0: 382.81; y1: 391.81; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="90.25" y0="382.81" x1="122.77">lifetime</span><span x0="122.77" y0="382.81" x1="125.77" style="x0: 122.77; x1: 125.77; y0: 382.81; y1: 391.81; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">)</span><span style="x0: 125.77; x1: 128.27; y0: 382.81; y1: 391.81; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="125.77" y0="382.81" x1="130.77">. </span><span x0="131.33" y0="382.81" x1="545.49" style="x0: 131.33; x1: 136.83; y0: 382.81; y1: 391.81; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Because they have high radiative efficiencies, SLCFs can have a&#160;strong effect on the climate even though they have relatively short lifetimes of up to about two decades after emission. Today, there is a&#160;balance between warming and cooling from SLCFs, but this can change in the future.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.42" top="340.81"><span x0="74.69" y0="340.81" x1="545.42" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 340.81; y1: 349.81; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The short lifetime of SLCFs constrains their effects in both space and time. First, of all the SLCFs, methane and the short-lived halocarbons persist the longest in the atmosphere: up to two decades (FAQ 6.1, Figure&#160;1). This is long enough to mix in the atmosphere and to spread globally. Most other SLCFs only remain in the atmosphere for a&#160;few days to weeks, which is generally too short for mixing in the atmosphere, sometimes even regionally. As a&#160;result, the SLCFs are unevenly distributed and their effects on the climate are more regional than those of longer-lived gases. Second, rapid (but sustained) changes in emissions of SLCFs can result in rapid climatic effects. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.42" top="262.83"><span x0="74.69" y0="262.83" x1="545.42" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 77.19; y0: 262.83; y1: 271.83; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In addition to the direct warming and cooling effects, SLCFs have many other consequences for the climate system and for air quality (see FAQ 6.2). For instance, deposition of black carbon on snow darkens its surface, which subsequently absorbs more solar energy, leading to more melting and more warming. Aerosols also modify the properties of clouds, which has indirect cooling effects on the climate and causes changes in local rainfall (see FAQ 7.2). Climate models indicate that SLCFs have altered atmospheric circulation on local and even hemispheric scales (e.g.,&#160;monsoons) as well as regional precipitation. For instance, recent observations show that regional weather is influenced by strong regional contrasts in the evolution of aerosol concentrations, particularly over South and East Asia. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="389.31" top="160.85"><span x0="74.69" y0="160.85" x1="389.31" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 81.19; y0: 160.85; y1: 169.85; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Although policies to limit climate change and discussions of the so-called </span><span style="x0: 389.97; x1: 393.47; y0: 160.85; y1: 169.85; width: 3.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="389.97" y0="160.85" x1="504.8">remaining carbon budgets </span><span x0="505.46" y0="160.85" x1="545.47" style="x0: 505.46; x1: 510.96; y0: 160.85; y1: 169.85; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">primarily focus on carbon dioxide (see FAQ 5.4), SLCFs can significantly affect temperature changes. It is therefore important to understand how SLCFs work and to quantify their effects. Because reducing some of the SLCF emissions, such as methane, can simultaneously reduce warming effects and adverse effects on air quality as well as help attaining Sustainable Development Goals, mitigation of SLCFs is often viewed as a&#160;favourable &#8216;win-win&#8217; policy option.</span></div></body></html>
