      <td>Figure SPM.5 | Changes in annual mean surface temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture\nPanel (a) Comparison of observed and simulated annual mean surface temperature change. The left map shows the observed changes in annual\nmean surface temperature in the period 1850&#8211;2020 per &#176;C of global warming (&#176;C). The local (i.e., grid point) observed annual mean surface temperature changes\nare linearly regressed against the global surface temperature in the period 1850&#8211;2020. Observed temperature data are from Berkeley Earth, the dataset with\nthe largest coverage and highest horizontal resolution. Linear regression is applied to all years for which data at the corresponding grid point is available. The\nregression method was used to take into account the complete observational time series and thereby reduce the role of internal variability at the grid point level.\nWhite indicates areas where time coverage was 100 years or less and thereby too short to calculate a reliable linear regression. The right map is based on model\nsimulations and shows change in annual multi-model mean simulated temperatures at a global warming level of 1&#176;C (20-year mean global surface temperature\nchange relative to 1850&#8211;1900). The triangles at each end of the colour bar indicate out-of-bound values, that is, values above or below the given limits.\nPanel (b) Simulated annual mean temperature change (&#176;C), panel (c) precipitation change (%), and panel (d) total column soil moisture change\n(standard deviation of interannual variability) at global warming levels of 1.5&#176;C, 2&#176;C and 4&#176;C (20-year mean global surface temperature change relative\nto 1850&#8211;1900). Simulated changes correspond to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model mean change (median change for soil\nmoisture) at the corresponding global warming level, that is, the same method as for the right map in panel (a).\nIn panel (c), high positive percentage changes in dry regions may correspond to small absolute changes. In panel (d), the unit is the standard deviation\nof interannual variability in soil moisture during 1850&#8211;1900. Standard deviation is a widely used metric in characterizing drought severity. A projected\nreduction in mean soil moisture by one standard deviation corresponds to soil moisture conditions typical of droughts that occurred about once every six years\nduring 1850&#8211;1900. In panel (d), large changes in dry regions with little interannual variability in the baseline conditions can correspond to small absolute</td>
