Her occupational environment, to some extent, limits her opportunities to fully appreciate the diverse social work roles in bolstering holistic client health associated with the broader scope of environmental and man-made crises. The GSW-specific in-class education and field training extended her understanding of social work interventions in the disaster landscape. The new knowledge has been encouraging the trainee to re-examine her interventions with the clients (school children and their families) affected by disasters, particularly during the 2015 European Refugee Crisis (at which time, refugee families were accepted into Canada and settled across the country), the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires in Alberta, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. All these disasters, directly and indirectly, affected her clients&#8217; physical health, mental health, and overall well-being. Social workers must swiftly adapt to this disaster-driven practice milieu by considering these disasters and related societal factors beyond their original occupational environment (in this case of elementary school settings). This adaptability also initiates a wide lens through which social workers can investigate interconnections among various health-related factors in developing disaster-informed interventions that advance the holistic consideration of inhabitants&#8217; health and well-being.</p>
