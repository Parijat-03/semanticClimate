But Oxfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>) deflates this number down more than three times, showing only $19-22 billion as climate-specific net assistance, of which $6-7 billion is for adaptation. Over-reporting of climate relevance of supported projects and reporting loans at face value (not its grant-equivalence) causes most of this inflated estimate. In 2017&#8211;18, only an estimated 20.5% of bilateral climate finance went to LDCs and 3% to SIDS, and a majority of it was in the form of loans and non-grant instruments (Oxfam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>), and the share of loans is increasing. In 2016-17, only 3% of the mobilized private finance was for adaptation. All these numbers speak for themselves: the Copenhagen pledge and the Paris Agreement are not being met.</p>
