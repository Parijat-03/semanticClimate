New materialism makes a core commitment to experiment with post-Cartesian ontologies that explore the variegated relationships between different nature-cultures. New materialists generally employ multi-modal methodologies that examine various levels (micro-, meso-, and macro-) of socio-ecological systems simultaneously (Coole and Frost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Jane Bennet is, for instance, one of the better-known new materialists. In <italic>Vibrant Matter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>), she develops a &#8220;vibrant materialism&#8221; that (like Latour) attributes agency to nonhumans, and that (like Whitehead) views living and non-living matter as co-constituting assemblages.</p>
