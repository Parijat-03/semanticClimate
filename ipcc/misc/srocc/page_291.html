Malcolm et al. (2006) found that more than 2000 plant species located within dryland biodiversity hotspots could become extinct within 100 years, starting 2004 (within the Cape Floristic Region, Mediterranean Basin and southwest Australia). Furthermore, it is suggested that land use and climate change could cause the loss of 17% of species within shrublands and&#160;8% within hot deserts by 2050 (</span><span style="x0: 236.55; x1: 238.66; y0: 663.53; y1: 673.03; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="236.55" y0="663.53" x1="290.71">low con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 290.71; x1: 293.35; y0: 663.53; y1: 673.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="290.71" y0="663.53" x1="313.21">) (van Vuuren et al. 2006). A&#160;study in the semi-arid Chinese Altai Mountains showed that mammal species richness will decline, rates of species turnover will increase, and more than 50% of their current ranges will be lost (Ye et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="591.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 591.54; y1: 601.04; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="591.54" x1="313.26">Changing climate and land use have resulted in higher aridity and more droughts in some drylands, with the rising role of precipitation, wind and evaporation on deserti&#64257;cation (Fischlin et al. 2007). In a&#160;2&#176;C world, annual water discharge is projected to decline, and heatwaves are projected to pose risk to food production by 2070 (Waha et al. 2017). However, Betts et al. (2018) found a&#160;mixed response of water availability (runoff) in dryland catchments to global temperature increases from&#160;1.5&#176;C to 2&#176;C. The forecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa suggest that higher temperatures, increase in the number of heatwaves, and increasing aridity, will affect the rainfed agricultural systems (Serdeczny et al. 2017). A&#160;study by Wang et al. (2009) in arid and semi-arid China showed decreased livestock productivity and grain yields from 2040 to 2099, threatening food security. In Central Asia, projections indicate a&#160;decrease in crop yields, and negative impacts of prolonged heat waves on population health (Reyer et al. 2017) (Section&#160;3.7.2). World Bank (2009) projected that, without the carbon fertilisation effect, climate change will reduce the mean yields for 11 major global crops&#160;&#8211; millet, &#64257;eld pea, sugar beet, sweet potato, wheat, rice, maize, soybean, groundnut, sun&#64258;ower and rapeseed&#160;&#8211; by 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11% in Middle East and North Africa, 18% in South Asia, and&#160;6% in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2046&#8211;2055, compared to 1996&#8211;2005. A&#160;separate meta-analysis suggested a&#160;similar reduction in yields in Africa and South Asia due to climate change by 2050 (Knox et al. 2012). Schlenker and Lobell (2010) estimated that in sub-Saharan Africa, crop production may be reduced by 17&#8211;22% due to climate change by 2050. At the local level, climate change impacts on crop yields vary by location (Section&#160;5.2.2). Negative impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity contribute to higher food prices. The imbalance between supply and demand for agricultural products is projected to increase agricultural prices in the range of 31% for rice, to 100% for maize by 2050 (Nelson et al. 2010), and cereal prices in the range between a&#160;32% increase and a&#160;16% decrease by 2030 (Hertel et al. 2010). In southern European Russia, it is projected that the yields of grain crops will decline by&#160;5&#8211;10% by 2050 due to the higher intensity and coverage of droughts (Ivanov et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="147.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 147.59; y1: 157.09; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="147.59" x1="313.25">Climate change can have strong impacts on poverty in drylands (</span><span style="x0: 67.84; x1: 74.7; y0: 135.6; y1: 145.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="67.84" y0="135.6" x1="139.57">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 139.57; x1: 142.21; y0: 135.6; y1: 145.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="139.57" y0="135.6" x1="313.23">) (Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017; Hertel and Lobell 2014). Globally, Hallegatte et al.

The impacts of climate change on poverty vary depending on whether the household is a&#160;net agricultural buyer or seller. Modelling results showed that poverty rates would increase by about one-third among the urban households and non-agricultural self-employed in Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Bangladesh due to high agricultural prices and low agricultural productivity under climate change (Hertel et al. 2010). On the contrary, modelled poverty rates fell substantially among agricultural households in Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, because higher prices compensated for productivity losses (Hertel et al. 2010).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="541.02" top="567.01"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.96; y0: 567.01; y1: 579.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="567.01" x1="541.02">1.6 Responses to deserti&#64257;cation under climate change </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="531.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 531.52; y1: 541.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="531.52" x1="571.77">Achieving sustainable development of dryland livelihoods requires avoiding dryland degradation through SLM and restoring and rehabilitating the degraded drylands due to their potential wealth of ecosystem bene&#64257;ts and importance to human livelihoods and economies (Thomas 2008). A&#160;broad suite of on-the-ground response measures exists to address deserti&#64257;cation (Scholes 2009), be it in the form of improved &#64257;re and grazing management, the control of erosion; integrated crop, soil and water management, among others (Liniger and Critchley 2007; Scholes 2009). These actions are part of the broader context of dryland development and long-term SLM within coupled socio-economic systems (Reynolds et al. 2007; Stringer et al. 2017; Webb et al. 2017). Many of these response options correspond to those grouped under &#8216;land transitions&#8217; in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of&#160;1.5&#176;C (Coninck et al. 2018) (Table&#160;6.4). It is therefore recognised that such actions require &#64257;nancial, institutional and policy support for their wide-scale adoption and sustainability over time (Sections&#160;3.6.3,&#160;4.8.5 and&#160;6.4.4).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="502.83" top="303.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.92; y0: 303.42; y1: 313.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="303.42" x1="502.83">1.6.1 SLM technologies and practices:  On-the-ground actions </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.64" top="267.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 267.52; y1: 277.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="267.52" x1="571.64">A broad range of activities and measures can help avoid, reduce and reverse degradation across the dryland areas of the world.

As preventing deserti&#64257;cation is strongly preferable and more cost-effective than allowing land to degrade and then attempting to restore it (IPBES 2018b; Webb et al. 2013), there is a&#160;growing emphasis on avoiding and reducing land degradation, following the Land Degradation Neutrality framework (Cowie et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2017) (Section&#160;4.8.5).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="123.54"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 123.54; y1: 133.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="123.54" x1="571.78">An assessment is made of six activities and measures practicable across the biomes and anthromes of the dryland domain (Figure&#160;3.10).
