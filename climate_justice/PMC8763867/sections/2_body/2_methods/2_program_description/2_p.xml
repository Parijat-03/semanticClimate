The small groups were overseen by coaches under the leadership of two head coaches (Jonathan D. Shaffer and Predrag Stojicic) who were alumni of Dr. Ganz's Harvard Kennedy School courses. The two facilitators who oversaw the workshop (Eleanor H. Emery and Gaurab Basu) were physicians with prior training in community organizing. Both had completed a full, 2.5-day community organizing training facilitated by Dr. Ganz and had previously coached in two or more public narrative workshops.</p>
