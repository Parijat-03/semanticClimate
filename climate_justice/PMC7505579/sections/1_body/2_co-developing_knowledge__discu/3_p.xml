Political agency is central to such endeavours by challenging assumptions and engaging with alternatives that may be invisible to the mainstream view <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>, such as post/degrowth initiatives at the local and regional levels <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. These transformations also engage in societal innovation by navigating the transformative climate action &#8216;in, against and beyond the state&#8217; in the transnational space <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. These groups, however, along with their societal and cultural power, are not fully taken into consideration in shaping global future scenarios, such as those given in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) narratives and quantitative trajectories <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>.</p>
