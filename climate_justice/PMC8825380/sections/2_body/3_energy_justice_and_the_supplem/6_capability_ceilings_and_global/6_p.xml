For each generation, there is, globally, the choice of either aggressively mitigating GHG or exposing future generations to dangerous climate change. For each generation, it would be better for those that can reduce their carbon footprint without being pushed below the threshold to do so&#8212;a non-tragic choice&#8212;in order to both reduce the risk of future dangerous climate change and allow peers of that generation to increase their capabilities to the threshold.</p>
