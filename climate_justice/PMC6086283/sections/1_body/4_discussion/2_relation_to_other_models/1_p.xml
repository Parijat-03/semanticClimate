This result is the exact inverse of prominent model architectures in research on social-ecological or socio-technical systems in the sustainability context (Cash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Geels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>; Geels and Schot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Holling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>; Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>). All these approaches include social phenomena and norms while adopting a fundamental premise related to the biological study of ND systems by Simon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1962</xref>): the relation of fast variables to lower levels, also called niche level, and slow variables to higher levels, also called landscape and sometimes regime level. Here, we propose a complementary approach based on the insight that combining modeling techniques is epistemologically promising in sustainability contexts (Peter and Swilling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>).</p>
