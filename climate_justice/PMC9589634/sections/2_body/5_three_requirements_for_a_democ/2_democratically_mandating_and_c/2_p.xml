At the same time, the design of non-majoritarian expert bodies (as much as that of any given decision-making procedure or institution), in particular by way of the selection of members from different disciplinary backgrounds or &#8216;schools of thought&#8217;, always constitutes an institutionalization of specific norms that promote some interests more than others. Against this background, it seems a dubious move to simply charge a standing expert committee with a new task, as was done in Germany when the government charged the Leopoldina, a somewhat obscure body of eminent academics, with the development of a strategy for re-opening schools and businesses. Instead, the selection of experts for a committee charged with far-reaching recommendations should be publicly justified.</p>
