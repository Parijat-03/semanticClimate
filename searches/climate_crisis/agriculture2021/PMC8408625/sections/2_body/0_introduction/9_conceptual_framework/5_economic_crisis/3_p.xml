<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0060">Mosquito control (mosquito abatement) is regarded as an effective way to reduce the incidence of WNV in humans <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is well documented, for example, that during the European debt crisis, the Greek government cut mosquito abatement budgets, which may have led to a rise in vector borne disease outbreaks such as malaria and WNV <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. WNV transmission is most likely to occur in places that favor the larval development of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, such as poorly drained low-lying areas, urban storm-water catch basins and manhole chambers, roadside ditches, sewage treatment lagoons, and man-made containers around houses, or other aquatic environments where mosquitoes deposit their eggs <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, during periods of austerity, governments can neglect hazard prevention efforts, such as spending on flood defenses, as well as essential works like sanitation and up-keep and improvement of infrastructure <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Such degradation can lead to the creation of mosquito habitats <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Another critical component of preventing disease transmission is through public education programs and health promotion, educating the public on measures which can prevent being bitten can reduce risk of exposure. In general, we would expect to see a general deterioration in a government ability to run such programs during crisis and austerity. Other consequences of austerity can be expected in decreased disease detection because of cuts in public health services, prolonged periods between initial infection and treatment seeking due to dysfunctional healthcare systems, and reduced treatment of disease, all of which can lead to more intense outbreaks <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p>
