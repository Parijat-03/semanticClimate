<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Examined temporally, SUHI intensity increases through a time when the measurement is averaged for all tracts and categorized by prevalent population group (See <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, the increase is only statistically significant for the White and Black prevalent census tracts. There is a high degree of variability from year to year among the Hispanic and Asian prevalent tracts, which is responsible for the lack of statistical significance. Reasons for these variations in SUHI intensity are hard to isolate but may be due to the overall residential mobility of these populations in urban areas relative to Black and White prevalent groupings [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Research has shown that residential mobility (household-level moving) patterns among Hispanic (and Black) urban residents work to reinforce segregation and this may be a factor in the variations observed [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Home and/or landscape improvement with varying owners may affect the local thermal environment. Additionally, there may be other spatial intricacies within the census tracts of these groups that contain more variability in land cover types, thereby adding to the higher variance. This would likely be especially variable in many locations in the Western U.S that lack some of the forest cover present elsewhere.</p>
