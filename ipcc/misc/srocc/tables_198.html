      <td>live in towns and cities (United Nations, 2017) generating around three-quarters of the global total carbon emissions from energy\nuse (Creutzig et al. 2015b; Seto et al. 2014). Urban food consumption is a large source of these anthropogenic GHG emissions\n(Goldstein et al. 2017). In developed countries, per capita emissions are larger in small cities than bigger ones, while the opposite\nis found in developing countries (Gudipudi et al. 2019). Climate change is expected to increase the energy demand of people living\nin urban areas (Santamouris et al. 2015; Wenz et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>In addition to being a driver of emissions, urbanisation contributes to forest degradation, converts neighbouring agricultural,\nforested or otherwise undeveloped land to urban use, altering natural or semi-natural ecosystems both within and outside of urban\nareas (Du and Huang 2017). It has been identified as a major driver of land degradation, as illustrated in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Highly\nproductive lands are experiencing the highest rate of conversion to urbanised landscapes (Nizeyimana et al. 2001; Pandey et al. 2018),\naffecting food security. Loss of agricultural land and increased pollution and waste are some of key challenges arising from urbanisation\nand urban growth (Chen 2007). The proportion of urban population is predicted to reach about 70% by the middle of the century\n(United Nations 2017) with growth especially taking place in the developing world (Angel et al. 2011; Dahiya 2012). Urban sprawl\nis projected to consume 1.8&#8211;2.4% and 5% of the current cultivated land by 2030 and 2050, respectively (Pradhan et al. 2014; Bren\nd&#8217;Amour et al. 2016), driven by both general population increase and immigration from rural areas (Adger et al. 2015; Seto et al. 2011;\nGeddes et al. 2012). New city dwellers in developing countries will require land for housing to be converted from non-urban to urban\nland (Barbero-Sierra et al. 2013), indicating future degradation. These growing urban areas will experience direct and indirect climate\nchange impacts, such as sea level rise and storm surges (Boettle et al. 2016; Revi et al. 2014), increasing soil salinity and landslides from\nprecipitation extremes. Furthermore, poorly planned urbanisation can increase people&#8217;s risk to climate hazards as informal settlements\nand poorly built infrastructure are often the most exposed to hazards from fire, flooding and landslides (Adger et al. 2015; Geddes et al.\n2012; Revi et al. 2014). Currently, avoiding land degradation and maintaining/enhancing ecosystem services are rarely considered in\nplanning processes (Kuang et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>There is high confidence that urbanisation increases mean annual surface air temperature in cities and in their surroundings, with\nincreases ranging from 0.19&#8211;2.60&#176;C (Torres-Valc&#225;rcel et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018a; Doan et al. 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 4; Figure 1).\nThis phenomenon is referred to as the urban heat island (UHI) effect (Oke et al. 2017; Bader et al. 2018). The magnitude and diurnal\namplitude of the UHI varies from one city to another and depends on the local background climate (Wienert and Kuttler 2005;\nZhao et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016). There is nevertheless high confidence that urbanisation affects night-time temperatures more\nsubstantially than daytime ones (Arg&#252;eso et al. 2014; Alghamdi and Moore 2015; Alizadeh-Choobari et al. 2016; Fujibe, 2009;\nHausfather et al. 2013; Liao et al. 2017; Sachindra et al. 2016; Camilloni and Barrucand 2012; Wang et al. 2017a; Hamdi, 2010;</td>
