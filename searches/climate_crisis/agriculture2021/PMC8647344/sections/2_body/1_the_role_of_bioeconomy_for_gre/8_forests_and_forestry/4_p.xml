In rural areas, this could create locally accessible sources of biomass (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>) and could contribute to the diversification of agricultural systems and rural regeneration. In urban and peri-urban areas, trees and forests could contribute similar benefits and also provide more opportunities for recreation, retreat, and engagement with nature. This is in addition to other recognized services of trees in urban areas, notably for moderating climate extremes. More generally, bio-based materials production could be coupled with &#8220;nature-based solutions&#8221; in the forest sector, contributing to urban greening and rural areas' revitalization (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hirst and Lazarus, 2020</xref>) as well as the deployment of cascading facilities to utilize locally produced biomass resources (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
