Connecting with employees at the beginning of their employment makes union membership more likely and increases commitment in those who join (Wasser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>, 3, 5). For example, the California Association of Highway Patrol conducts a union orientation process when officers graduate from the academy, resulting in a 97% membership rate (Ashton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). Several states have enacted legislation providing unions with information about new employees and access to new employees during orientation (Fisk and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>, 1872&#8211;73). These laws require employers to provide unions with notice of employee orientations and an opportunity to meet with employees outside the presence of supervisors (Fisk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>, 347&#8211;48). To facilitate access, unions have sought, and in some cases obtained, legislation authorizing use of the employer&#8217;s email system for union communications, along with detailed information about employees in the bargaining unit (N.J. Stat. Ann. &#167; 34:13A-5.13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>). While increasing their own access to information, unions have supported legislation to prevent release of employee contact information to outside organizations, in order to limit the ability of anti-union forces to contact the employees (Cal. Government Code &#167; 6254.32017).</p>
