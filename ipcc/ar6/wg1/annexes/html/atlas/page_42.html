Mean absolute error values obtained for the considered variables are about 1.2&#176;C 4 for temperature, about 15 mm per month for precipitation, about 9% for total cloud cover, and about 0.6 hPa 5 for mean sea-level pressure. COSMO-CLM is relatively able to improve the simulated main climate features 6 of this very complex area (Bucchignani et al., 2016). The ability of the RegCM4.4 regional climate model to 7 reproduce the observed climatology over the same domain is found sufficient especially for dry regions with 8 an overall temperature bias of the model within &#177; 3.0&#176;C. Precipitation amounts were overestimated by the 9 RCM in almost all parts of the domain for all seasons except the Sahara Desert, the Western Sahara, and the 10 Sahel regions with hyper-arid/arid and semiarid climates (Ozturk et al., 2018). 11 12 For 22 CMIP3 models, most of them simulate warm (cold) bias over the southern (central and northern) parts 13 of the Arabian peninsula. Similar to the temperature, the precipitation bias also varies among the CMIP3 14 models (Almazroui et al., 2017c). A large portion of the Arabian Peninsula is dominated by the dry bias in 15 most of the model simulations. However, some CMIP3 models also display a wet bias, especially over the 16 south-eastern parts of the peninsula. For 30 CMIP5 models, the simulated temperature bias with respect to 17 the surface observation indicates that overall 18 models fall within one standard deviation and 12 fall outside 18 this range (Almazroui et al., 2017b). Over the Arabian Peninsula, a cold bias for most of the months and 19 warm bias for summer months are reported by Lelieveld et al. (2016) in 26 CMIP5 models. The model 20 precipitation bias with respect to the surface observation indicates that most of the models underestimate wet 21 season precipitation and overestimate dry season precipitation with 26 models falling within one standard 22 deviation. For the Arabian Peninsula, the evaluation of five GCMs (HadGEM2, GFDL, CNRM, CanESM2, 23 and ECHAM6) downscaled with an RCM over the CORDEX-MENA domain identified that most models 24 had a cold bias (of about 0.70&#176;C) and underestimated precipitation over the Arabian Peninsula by 13% 25 compared to observations (Almazroui, 2016). A warm (cold) bias over the south-eastern (western) parts of 26 the peninsula is reported by Syed et al. (2019).  27 28 29 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 405.89; y1: 416.87; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="405.89" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.3.2.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="405.89" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 405.89; y1: 416.87; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">30 Individual studies based on the future climate projections using global climate model outputs over West and 31 Central Asia countries including Armenia (Vermishev and Moir, 2015; Gevorgyan et al., 2016a), Azerbaijan 32 (Osborn et al., 2016), Georgia (GMENR, 2015), Iran (IDOE, 2017), Iraq (Salman, Shahid, Ismail, Chung, &amp; 33 Al-Abadi, 2017), Tajikistan (Aalto et al., 2017) and Turkmenistan (Allaberdiyev, 2010) (for more detail see 34 Table Atlas.A.2) stated that an increase in temperatures are expected by the end of the century. The intensity 35 of future warming depends on season, timescale and scenario and will be approximately up to 7&#176;C. On the 36 other hand, there is a large uncertainty about future projections of precipitation. Results show a general 37 decrease in precipitation and an opposite change is predicted over high-mountain regions, where 38 precipitation is projected to increase (Aalto et al., 2017; Salman et al., 2018).   39 40 Projections from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles shown in Figure Atlas.27: are for temperatures to 41 continue to increase into the future with further annual mean warming of over 2&#176;C by mid-century and up to 42 6&#176;C by the end of century under the RCP8.5 scenario (with greater warming projected by the CMIP6 43 ensemble). Conversely there is no clear signal in precipitation. Overall, the projections by the end of the 44 century (2081&#8211;2100) indicate little overall change, although with a tendency for reduced precipitation, 45 particularly for the higher emission scenarios.
