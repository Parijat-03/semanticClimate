Increasing heat and precipitation alter the range of disease vectors, increasing it in some locations while decreasing it in others. Climate change thus induces &#8220;a potential for disease&#8221; by increasing the conditions suitable for disease transmission. The number of people newly at risk of potential viral transmission by the mosquito species <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>A albopictus</italic> will approach one billion within this century.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This includes dengue virus, for which global vectorial capacity is increasing &#8220;in step&#8221; with global carbon dioxide emissions, and yellow fever; both these diseases are mentioned in annex 2 of the International Health Regulations as having the potential to constitute an international public health emergency.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Country borders offer little defence against the global expansion and redistribution of disease, so climate change requires a coordinated international response.</p>
