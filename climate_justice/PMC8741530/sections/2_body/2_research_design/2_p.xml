Firstly, China&#8217;s discursive construction. In China&#8217;s climate narratives, how China is referred to and what kind of characteristics are ascribed to China discursively, and how China frames climate change governance and issues of climate justice in particular. By focusing on these discursive aspects, this article will specifically examine speeches of China&#8217;s leadership and climate negotiators, official policy documents, state-owned newspapers and interview data. Secondly, China&#8217;s policy practice. By focusing on China&#8217;s domestic and international climate policy behaviours and its climate diplomacy within international climate negotiations, this article will investigate how China&#8217;s role in climate governance has changed, how China interacts with other actors and how the significance of climate change governance in China&#8217;s global presence has changed.</p>
