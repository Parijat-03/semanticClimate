In particular, we evaluate the relationship among different measures of vulnerability, extreme heat, and adaptation investment. We employ the definitions of vulnerability and exposure used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Exposure is &#8220;the presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Vulnerability is &#8220;the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We follow the precedent set by the state of California and the California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA) regarding language used to describe environmental justice communities, while recognizing that the terms &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; can be seen as disempowering and are often not terms preferred by the communities [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, a &#8220;disadvantaged community&#8221; is therefore a census tract whose vulnerability index percentile value is in the upper quartile.</p>
