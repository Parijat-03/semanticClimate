<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It is vital that health workers and leaders are aware of the broader interactions between society, the provision of sustainable health services, and their combined influence on health and equity. Also, many of the important actions to address the environmental threats to the planet&#8217;s ecosystems and human civilization are the same that are needed to enhancing equity in human health and development. In this regard, the same issues related to imbalances in the distribution of power, money and resources, shape the decisions of millions to use and develop renewable energy options or cast them aside. This is particularly true for air pollution. Several steps can be taken by health actors to address harmful environmental trends including by reducing their own carbon footprint. Beyond that, health actors can promote science, education and training that link equity and sustainability issues. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a platform and framework for collaboration across key dimensions of sustainable development and planetary health (including climate actions) that can allow for leveraging the inputs and outcomes of education and training activities in a manner that is consistent, coherent and mutually reinforcing (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2015</xref>). The platform has established an umbrella under which coalitions of policy-makers for climate justice can be built, including through orchestrating a Planetary Health and Health in All Policies approach, which is used to address the social determinants of health.</p>
