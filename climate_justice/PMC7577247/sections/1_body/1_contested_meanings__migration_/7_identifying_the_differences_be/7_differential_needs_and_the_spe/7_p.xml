<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0150">We argue that the categories described in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> are not static but fluid conditions. An individual or group may migrate and then retreat and vice versa. For example, climate-migrants who live in an uninhabitable refugee camp affected by repetitive flooding may retreat to a new camp site with less flooding. Also, a family who retreat from wildfire-prone areas to a new location may find the resettlement site culturally-hostile and therefore may migrate within the same country or internationally. In the case of the latter, the migration is not directly driven by climate change impacts but by conflict with host communities. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> should therefore be seen as a representation and not a determinant of mobility patterns for every CDPs.</p>
