<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We analyzed the level of agreement among three different social vulnerability indices: SVI, HHAI, and CES. SVI is able to &#8220;provide state, local, and tribal disaster management personnel information to target for intervention those [census] tracts that may be socially vulnerable before, during, and after a hazard event&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It was included in this analysis because it is the index used by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in determining those most vulnerable to disasters of all forms. HHAI was created in California&#8217;s Fourth Climate Change Assessment to &#8220;identify neighborhoods or areas that are likely to be more susceptible to future [heat-health events]&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It was studied because it is designed to measure heat-specific vulnerability in California. HHAI scores were converted to percentile ranks for ease of comparison to the other indices. Finally, CES aims to identify &#8220;communities most burdened by pollution from multiple sources and most vulnerable to its effects, taking into account the socioeconomic and health status of people living in those communities&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unlike HHAI and SVI, CES was not directly intended to be used in the context of climate risks, although pollution exposure can exacerbate climate change impacts. We analyzed CES because it is the metric that the state is directed to use for designating a community&#8217;s status as &#8220;disadvantaged.&#8221; To understand the degree of overlap among the different indices, we classified each variable in each index as pertaining to economic, demographic, health, or environmental conditions.</p>
