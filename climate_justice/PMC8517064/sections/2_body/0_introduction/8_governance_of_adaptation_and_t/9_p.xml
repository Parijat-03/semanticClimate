For adaptation, the discourse on the need and means of financing adaptation emerged from the UNFCCC policy process. The science and concepts of adaptation have been developed under the aegis of the IPCC. There has been an evolution of agencies and channels handling the financing of adaptation over time, with a prominent role for multilateral institutions. The Adaptation Fund, Special Climate Change Fund and the Least Developed Country Funds were established in 2001 as trust funds managed by the Global Environmental Facility, the Climate Investment Fund was established in 2008 with two trust funds that channel resources through MDBs (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016a</xref>).</p>
