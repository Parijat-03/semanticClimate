Communication approaches favoured 5 by users are not always the approaches that achieve greatest accuracy in interpretation. Best-practice 6 guidance is emerging to achieve greater consistency in the understanding and use of climate information.  7 8 Here, a brief overview of concepts of climate change communication is given, also listed in Chapter 10.5.1, 9 including the effectiveness of the various communication strategies some of which are followed by the 10 IPCC. 11 12 13 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 608.27; y1: 619.25; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="608.27" x1="348.48">Atlas.6.1.1 Interpretation and extrapolation of historical trends  </span><span x0="27.66" y0="608.27" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 608.27; y1: 619.25; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">14 15 Observed trends at the global, local and regional scale provide empirical evidence of a non-stationary 16 climatology. Issues with quality, representativity, and consistency with other lines of evidence are often 17 illustrated in this assessment report (see for example the comparison of various observational datasets in the 18 regional climate change assessments in Section Atlas.5). These issues lead to systematic constraints on their 19 use for attribution of causes of trends (see Section Atlas.5). The practice of attributing trends and extreme 20 events to human causes gives confidence that these trends may be expected to continue in the (near) future, 21 provided the human drivers of climate change remain unchanged. However, large internal variability at 22 decadal time scales can be mistaken for a systematic human impact on the likelihood of extreme events, and 23 in that case extrapolation of trends cannot be expected to be a reliable estimator for the future (Schiermeier, 24 2018). 25 26 Extrapolation of trends can be a viable approach when the time scale of the quantity of interest is long 27 compared with the time window for which the information on future conditions is required. This applies for 28 instance to sea level rise, where observed trends at the local scale are generally extrapolated to near-future 29 time ranges to assist planning of beach nourishment programs and near-term adaptation interventions 30 (Daron, 2015; Baart et al., 2018). 31 32 33 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 354.29; y1: 365.27; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="354.29" x1="423.25">Atlas.6.1.2 Direct use of the output from GCMs, including high resolution GCMs </span><span x0="27.66" y0="354.29" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 354.29; y1: 365.27; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">34 35 Outputs from Global Climate Models (GCMs) are a basic repository of many climate change information 36 programs (see Chapter 4 for a review). Issues of systematic biases, drifts, internal variability, assumptions on 37 forcings, spatial and temporal scale, data availability, experimental design and aggregation of ensembles of 38 projections have been assessed in multiple sections of this report. Scenario storylines are needed to interpret 39 the outcome of future projections using a specific time-varying forcing. Even after careful filtering and 40 correcting for all these issues, GCM outputs generally give a relatively coarse picture of climate change, 41 which is deemed useful to feed global mitigation planning but are rarely applicable to local climate change 42 adaptation (van den Hurk et al., 2018). Interactions between the physical and socio-economical elements of 43 the climate system is included in the methodology in choosing scenario assumptions and following driver-44 effect cascades from the climate response to anthropogenic forcings to regional impacts and risk changes 45 (Berkhout et al., 2013). In this &#8216;top-down&#8217; mapping approach, uncertainty generally increases with longer 46 time scales and smaller spatial and sectoral domains.  47 48 49 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 150.95; y1: 161.93; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="150.95" x1="279.99">Atlas.6.1.3 Application of downscaling of GCMs </span><span x0="27.66" y0="150.95" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 150.95; y1: 161.93; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">50 51 Downscaling global projections with regional climate models (RCMs) or statistical downscaling adds spatial 52 detail, but also adds a source of uncertainty, related to the selection of the chosen downscaling method (see 53 Section 10.3).  54 55 </span></div></body></html>
