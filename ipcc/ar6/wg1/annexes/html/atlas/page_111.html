The 2 HKH and the elevated Tibetan Plateau exert significant influence on the Asian summer monsoon system. 3 The HKH is sensitive to climate change and variability (Krishnan et al., 2019). The atmospheric features of 4 the region are influenced by three distinct weather systems, known as westerly storms, summer monsoon and 5 anticyclonic clear weather conditions (Bashir et al., 2017). 6 7 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.4; y0: 684.17; y1: 695.15; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="684.17" x1="254.96">Previous findings from IPCC assessments </span><span x0="33.18" y0="684.17" x1="41.44" style="x0: 33.18; x1: 38.67; y0: 684.17; y1: 695.15; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">8 9 In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC&#8217;s) Fourth Assessment Report (Pachauri and 10 Reisinger, 2007) pointed to the lack of consistent long-term monitoring in the HKH. Little progress was 11 made in the HKH by the time of the IPCC&#8217;s Fifth Assessment Report (Pachauri and Meyer, 2014). The 12 precipitation is not simulated well at regional scales by global climate models used in CMIP5 experiments 13 for the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5), and the assessment is hampered by observational uncertainties 14 (Flato et al., 2013). The AR5 highlights that the projected changes in the water cycle at regional scale will be 15 strongly influenced by natural internal variability and may be affected by anthropogenic aerosol emissions. 16 The monsoon winds are likely to weaken, however the monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify due to the 17 availability of more moisture in the atmosphere (Krishnan et al., 2013; KITOH, 2017).

The HKH has seen significant warming in the past 31 decades nearly equal to the global average (Krishnan et al., 2019a). The annual mean surface air temperature 32 has increased significantly in the HKH at a rate of about 0.1 &#176;C per decade during 1901&#8211;2014, with larger 33 change of more than 0.2&#176;C per decade in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and southern Pakistan (Ren et al., 2017a). 34 The annual mean temperature in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is warming at a rate of 0.316&#176;C per decade during 35 1961&#8211;2012 (Yan and Liu, 2014), which is almost twice the previous estimate for 1955&#8211;1996 period by Liu 36 and Chen (2000). The observed annual and winter mean temperatures at high elevation sites (&gt;2,000 m) of 37 the eastern TP have increased at a rate of about 0.42&#176;C per decade and 0.61&#176;C per decade respectively during 38 1961&#8211;2006, while the low-elevation sites (&lt;500 m) have warmed at a rate of about 0.2&#176;C per decade during 39 the same period (Liu et al., 2009).  40 41 The variability of seasonal weather patterns together with the confluence of different mountain ranges makes 42 the topography of the HKH region so complex that the relationship between rainfall and topography is 43 poorly defined (Palazzi et al., 2013). These complexities had posed difficulties in discerning precipitation 44 trends within the HKH in recent decades though using satellite rainfall estimates, reanalyses, and gridded in 45 situ rain gauge data they assessed that the observed summer monsoon precipitation in Himalaya is 46 decreasing significantly (Palazzi et al., 2013).  47 48 The datasets used for the study of seasonal mean temperature and precipitation over the Himalayan region 49 are gridded datasets CRU and APHRODITE, which have been used by regional climate modelling, model 50 evaluation and inter comparison studies, e.g., CORDEX South Asia (Latif et al., 2017; Sanjay et al., 2017b; 51 Choudhary and Dimri, 2018b; Ghimire et al., 2018; Nengker, T.; Choudhary, A.; Dimri, 2018). Monthly and 52 daily pre-1950 data are lacking for most parts of the HKH, and the gap is particularly large for areas outside 53 of India. The daily data post-1950 are also insufficient in some areas, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, 54 Myanmar, Bhutan, and Nepal, and the north-western part of the Tibetan Plateau (TP).
