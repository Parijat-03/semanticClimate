AR6 assesses key risks across sectors and regions as well as providing an updated assessment of the Reasons for Concern (RFCs) &#8211; five globally aggregated categories of risk that evaluate risk accrual with increasing global surface temperature. Risks can also arise from climate change mitigation or adaptation responses when the response does not achieve its intended objective, or when it results in adverse effects for other societal objectives. {WGII SPM A, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII Box TS.1, WGII Figure TS.4; SR1.5 Figure SPM.2; SRCCL Figure SPM.2; SROCC Errata Figure SPM.3} (3.1.2, Cross-Section Box.2, Figure 1; Figure 3.3) </span></div><div left="56.64" right="297.26" top="648.47"><span x0="56.64" y0="648.47" x1="297.26" style="x0: 56.64; x1: 59.96; y0: 648.47; y1: 658.43; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">[START CROSS-SECTION BOX.2, FIGURE 1 HERE] </span></div><div left="56.64" right="540.54" top="82.2"><span x0="56.64" y0="82.2" x1="540.54" style="x0: 56.64; x1: 61.14; y0: 82.2; y1: 91.2; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">* The terminology SSPx-y is used, where &#8216;SSPx&#8217; refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway or &#8216;SSP&#8217; describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenario, and &#8216;y&#8217; refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m</span><span x0="529.42" y0="75.53" x1="535.42" style="x0: 529.42; x1: 532.42; y0: 75.53; y1: 81.53; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">&#8211;2</span><span x0="535.42" y0="71.88" x1="540.55" style="x0: 535.42; x1: 538.42; y0: 71.88; y1: 80.88; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. </span></div></body></html>
