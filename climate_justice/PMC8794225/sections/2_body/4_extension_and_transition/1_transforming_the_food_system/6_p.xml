Through Food System Economic Partnerships, Extension could teach critical perspectives on the history, political economy, and ecological impact of industrial agriculture and the suppression of viable alternatives to diverse stakeholders to catalyze food system transformation (Colasanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). Liberation Extension could train and empower a new generation of agents and community leaders to advocate for substantive change in the food system and implement it through CSAs, urban agriculture, food pantries, and farm to school programs, scaling up through land trusts and cooperatives.</p>
