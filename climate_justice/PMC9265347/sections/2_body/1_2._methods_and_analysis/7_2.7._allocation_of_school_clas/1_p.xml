Due to logistical constraints, allocation to the intervention and control group was performed locally by teachers. Teachers participating in the pilot study with two classes allocated the classes by tossing a coin. Teachers participating in the pilot study with one class only allocated their class to the intervention or control group without constraints.</p>
