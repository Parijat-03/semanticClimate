<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0003">Other climate crises are occurring with more frequency and intensity throughout the Americas. The 4-year US withdrawal from the global climate community has taken its toll. The USA is the second largest greenhouse gas emitter and responsible for producing more than 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year since 1990. Although the hurricane season is expected yearly, there was a rapid development of Hurricane Ida in August 2021. This was not just a random occasion. Warmer-than-usual temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico, due to ocean-level increases, sped up the process, leading to a class-4 hurricane. Hurricane Ida first hit the state of Louisiana, resulting in major floods, power outages and destruction, and a death toll of 26 people, 16 years after Hurricane Katrina&#180;s destruction in New Orleans and just one year after Hurricane Laura. Although it lost its force, Hurricane Ida did not stop in Louisiana; because of warmer temperatures in the atmosphere, the aftermath of this climate event resulted in major floods in four other US states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. At the time of writing, 50 people were confirmed dead in these four states. The occurrence of slower and stronger hurricanes can be progressively frequent as the climate crisis worsens.</p>
