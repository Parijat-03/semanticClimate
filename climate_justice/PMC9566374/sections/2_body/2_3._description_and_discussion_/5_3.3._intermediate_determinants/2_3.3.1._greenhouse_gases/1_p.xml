<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Atmospheric gases of anthropogenic origin contributing to the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), ozone, and halocarbons. The concentrations of these GHGs have substantially increased over the last few decades [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The framework described here identifies the main models causing anthropogenic GHG emissions. Currently, the main sources of GHG are energy production (due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions derived from the carbon-burning process, especially of coal and oil), and transport (due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from motor vehicles). However, also important are housing and industry (especially due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion, which is highly influenced by its energy efficiency), as well as food, due to the globalized production model, which increases emissions through transport of products, displacing traditional consumption of locally-grown food, deforestation of some areas to increase production, and higher meat consumption in the diet, especially from bovines (ruminants produce high levels of methane, an important GHG) [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
