Furthermore, we investigated associations between heavy rainfall and HIV transmission risk, including number of sexual partners and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We hypothesized that heavy rainfall events are associated with increases in HIV prevalence, as well as higher risk of sexual transmission, with associations more prevalent among women and individuals living in rural areas.</p>
