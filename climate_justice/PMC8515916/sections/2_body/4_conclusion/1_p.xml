Children are particularly vulnerable both to the short- and long-term consequences of climate change and should be at the core of climate adaptation strategies. Furthermore, the definition of a climate refugee is critical for the protection of the vulnerable populations displaced nationally and globally as a consequence of climate change. LMICs bear the highest burden of impacts despite their overall low contribution to GHG emissions but are still lacking the technical competencies and the necessary bargaining powers to mitigate, and adapt to, the effects of changing climate. Concurrently, the growing GHG emissions from LMICs in the last few decades has highlighted the need for sustainable economic development using green solutions and energy, through collaboration with HICs.</p>
