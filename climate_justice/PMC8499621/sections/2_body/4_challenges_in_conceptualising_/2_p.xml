Quantitative approaches have tended to focus mostly on proximate causes, which can obscure important structural and political drivers of the distribution of mental health effects of climate-related heatwaves, floods, wildfires and droughts.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Studies which have found associations between heat and mental health outcomes such as suicide have also cautioned about the difficulties of ascertaining causal effects using an ecological study design.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
