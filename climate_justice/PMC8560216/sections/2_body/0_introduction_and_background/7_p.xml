Anyone can create a podcast as long as they have a topic idea and can afford the basic cost of a microphone, headphones, a laptop, and a hosting platform. The cost can increase based on how much one wants to invest in equipment, editing, content development, and marketing. The start-up cost of podcasts ranges anywhere from $100 to $3,000 (Ruoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2018</xref>). Additionally, recurring costs are manageable and predictable. The main resource that is required is time for production and content development.</p>
