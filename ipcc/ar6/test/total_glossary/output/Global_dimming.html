<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Global dimming refers to the observed widespread reduction in the amount of <em>solar radiation</em> received at the Earth’s surface from the 1950s to the 1980s, with an increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions appearing to have contributed.</p>
<p>This was followed by a partial recovery since the 1990s (‘brightening’), particularly in industrialized areas, coincident with a reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions.</p>
