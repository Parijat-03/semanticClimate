<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the above vignette, CISCSA&#8217;s feminist school works from the scale of the body
to understand the household, the neighbourhood, the city and the wider territory
(see <xref rid="fig2-09562478221115334" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This
engagement with felt and sensed areas of pain and joy, of repression and
freedom, allows learners to connect with their own maps of
<italic toggle="yes">sentipensar</italic> and those of others, and to trace patriarchal
and racist genealogies, active in the present way in which women&#8217;s bodies can
and cannot inhabit the city; aiming, in short, to counteract their disembodiment
from the city.</p>
