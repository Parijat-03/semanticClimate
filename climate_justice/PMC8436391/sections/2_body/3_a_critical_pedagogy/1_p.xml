<p>Internationally, there is renewed focus on critical pedagogies to &#8216;reinvigorate social
work education as an emancipatory practice&#8217; (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Morley
<italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al</italic>., 2020</xref>, p. 1). At a meta-theoretical level, we lean
towards a critical realist perspective because it is community orientated and encompasses a
range of transformative theoretical approaches and practices (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Forde and Lynch, 2015</xref>). We argue that this perspective broadens the scope of practices
for transformative social change. It challenges the polemic of ideology versus practice which
supports conditions for a reflective praxis, i.e. the integration of theory, research and
practice in social work education. It seeks to uncover oppressive structures and fully
recognizes the role of critical thinking and purposeful actions to tackle oppression and
activate meaningful change with groups and communities. We align with Brookfield&#8217;s
critical pedagogy which is located in the tradition of critical social theory. This approach
demonstrates the clear connections between critical theorizing, analysis and critical reflection
in teaching and learning which emphasizes human agency and underpins actions for social change
