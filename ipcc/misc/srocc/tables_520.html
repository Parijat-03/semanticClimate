      <td>used to implement SI are inherently &#8216;landscape approaches&#8217;\n(e.g., Hodgson et al. 2010). While the term landscape is by no\nmeans precise (Englund et al. 2017), landscape approaches,\nfocused, for example, at catchment scale, are generally\nagreed to be the best way to tackle competing demands\nfor land (e.g., Sayer et al. 2013), and are the appropriate\nscale at which to focus the implementation of sustainable\nintensification. The landscape approach allots land to\nvarious uses &#8211; cropping, intensive and extensive grazing,\nforestry, mining, conservation, recreation, urban, industry,\ninfrastructure &#8211; through a planning process that seeks\nto balance conservation and production objectives. With\nrespect to SI, a landscape approach is pertinent to achieving\npotential benefits for biodiversity conservation, ensuring that\nland &#8216;spared&#8217; through SI remains protected, and that adverse\nimpacts of agriculture on conservation land are minimised.\nDepending on the land governance mechanisms applied in\nthe jurisdiction, different approaches will be appropriate/\nrequired. However, benefits are only assured if land-use\nrestrictions are devised and enforced.</td>

Improving the efficiency\nof agriculture systems can increase production per unit of\nland through more effective resource use. To achieve SI,\nsome intensively managed agricultural systems may have to\nbe diversified as they cannot be further intensified without\nland degradation. A combination of land sparing and sharing\noptions can be utilised to achieve SI &#8211; their application is\nmost likely to succeed if applied using a landscape approach.</td>
