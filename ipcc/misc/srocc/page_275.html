Moderate or higher severity degradation over recent decades has been identi&#64257;ed in many river basins including the Nile (42% of area), Niger (50%), Senegal (51%), Volta (67%), Limpopo (66%) and Lake Chad (26%) (Thiombiano and Tourino-Soto 2007).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="495.55" x1="313.25">The Horn of Africa is getting drier (Damberg and AghaKouchak 2014; Marshall et al. 2012) exacerbating the deserti&#64257;cation already occurring (Oroda 2001). The observed decline in vegetation cover is diminishing ecosystem services (Pricope et al. 2013). Based on NDVI residuals, Kenya experienced persistent negative (positive) trends over 21.6% (8.9%) of the country, for the period 1992&#8211;2015 (Gichenje and Godinho 2018). Fragmentation of habitats, reduction in the range of livestock grazing, and higher stocking rates are considered to be the main drivers for vegetation structure loss in the rangelands of Kenya (Kihiu 2016; Otuoma et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="363.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 363.56; y1: 373.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="363.56" x1="313.23">Despite deserti&#64257;cation in the Sahel being a&#160;major concern since the 1970s, wetting and greening conditions have been observed in this region over the last three decades (Anyamba and Tucker 2005; Huber et al. 2011; Brandt et al. 2015; Rishmawi et al. 2016; Tian&#160;et al. 2016; Leroux et al. 2017; Herrmann et al. 2005; Damberg and AghaKouchak 2014). Cropland areas in the Sahel region of West Africa have doubled since 1975, with settlement area increasing by about 150% (Traore et al. 2014). Thomas and Nigam (2018) found that the Sahara expanded by 10% over the 20th century based on annual rainfall. In Burkina Faso, Dimobe et al. (2015) estimated that from 1984 to 2013, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 18.8% and 89.7%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, tree savannahs, shrub savannahs and water bodies decreased by 18.8%, 19.4%,&#160;4.8%, 45.2% and 31.2%, respectively. In Fakara region in Niger, a&#160;5% annual reduction in herbaceous yield between 1994 and 2006 was largely explained by changes in land use, grazing pressure and soil fertility (Hiernaux et al. 2009). Aladejana et al. (2018) found that between 1986 and 2015, 18.6% of the forest cover around the Owena River basin was lost. For the period 1982&#8211;2003, Le et al.

Ayoub (1998) identi&#64257;ed 64 Mha in Sudan as degraded, with the Central North Kordofan state being most affected. However, reforestation measures in the last decade sustained by improved rainfall conditions have led to low-medium regrowth conditions in about 20% of the area (Dawelbait and Morari 2012). In Morocco, areas affected by deserti&#64257;cation were predominantly on plains with high population and livestock pressure (del Barrio et al. 2016; Kouba et al. 2018; Lahlaoi et al. 2017). The annual costs of soil degradation were estimated at about&#160;1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Algeria and Egypt, and about&#160;0.5% in Morocco and Tunisia (R&#233;quier-Desjardins and Bied-Charreton 2006).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="339.2" top="447.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 447.57; y1: 457.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.72" y0="447.57" x1="339.2">Asia</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="423.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.29; y0: 423.57; y1: 433.07; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="423.57" x1="571.74">Pr&#259;v&#259;lie (2016) found that deserti&#64257;cation is currently affecting 38 of 48 countries in Asia. The changes in drylands in Asia over the period 1982&#8211;2011 were mixed, with some areas experiencing vegetation improvement while others showed reduced vegetation (Miao&#160;et al. 2015a). Major river basins undergoing salinisation include: Indo-Gangetic Basin in India (Lal and Stewart 2012), Indus Basin in Pakistan (Aslam and Prathapar 2006), Yellow River Basin in China (Chengrui and Dregne 2001), Yinchuan Plain in China (Zhou&#160;et al. 2013), Aral Sea Basin of Central Asia (Cai et al. 2003; Pankova 2016; Qadir et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="291.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 291.58; y1: 301.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="291.58" x1="571.78">Helld&#233;n and Tottrup (2008) highlighted a&#160;greening trend in East Asia between 1982 and 2003. Over the past several decades, air temperature and the rainfall increased in the arid and hyper-arid region of Northwest China (Chen et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017). Within China, rainfall erosivity has shown a&#160;positive trend in dryland areas between 1961 and 2012 (Yang and Lu 2015). While water erosion area in Xinjiang, China, has decreased by 23.2%, erosion considered as severe or intense was still increasing (Zhang et al. 2015). Xue et al. (2017) used remote sensing data covering 1975 to 2015 to show that wind-driven deserti&#64257;ed land in northern Shanxi in China had expanded until 2000, before contracting again. Li&#160;et al. (2012) used satellite data to identify deserti&#64257;cation in Inner Mongolia, China and found a&#160;link between policy changes and the locations and extent of human-caused deserti&#64257;cation. Several oasis regions in China have seen increases in cropland area, while forests, grasslands and available water resources have decreased (Fu et al. 2017; Muyibul et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2014). Between 1990 and 2011 15.3% of Hogno Khaan nature reserve in central Mongolia was subjected to deserti&#64257;cation (Lamchin et al. 2016). Using satellite data Liu et al.
