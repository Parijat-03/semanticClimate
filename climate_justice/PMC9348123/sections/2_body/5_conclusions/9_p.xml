Methodological analyses of this study would contribute to develop theoretical models based on SNS (see e.g.,<xref rid="hpm3500-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>). This study would shed new light on how people communicate with each other for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic according to age groups, which contributes to theory and literature in health communication and social network research. For example, the findings of this article could contribute to information and health literature, such as improving theoretical coverage, reducing methodological biases, strengthening causality linkages, reducing interference of noise, improving validity and reliability of models, and developing theory that works well within limitations (see e.g.,<xref rid="hpm3500-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">
