To invite schools, we disseminated information on the content and delivery of the PCS via all state ministries of education. In addition, we used social media channels and newsletters of the Fridays for Future, Students for Future and Teachers for Future networks, the PCS newsletter and the network of schools established during previous offerings of the PCS in November 2020 and May 2021.</p>
