<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par24">These discourses on relational ontology (SR, process philosophy, and new materialism) are comparatively recent developments emerging within Western thought. Most relational ontologies have, however, developed historically outside the West for millennia (Todd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2016</xref>). Worldwide, there are many non-modern, earth-based, indigenous and religious ontologies that never inherited the bifurcation of nature/culture characteristic of the Western modern worldview. These traditions all focus on the inter-related, inter-dependent, and inter-active aspects of nature-cultures. Unlike Western environmentalism, these traditions do not relate to the environment as something &#8216;out there&#8217; that needs to be protected. Landscapes are considered both physical and mental phenomena, bearing the markings of personal and collective biographies, task-scapes, customs, rituals, and cosmologies (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2014</xref>; Miller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2017</xref>). Indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example, follow a relational ontology based on kinship. They perceive themselves and nature as part of the same family sharing origins and ancestral bonds (Salmon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2000</xref>; Datta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>; Posthumus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2018</xref>).</p>
