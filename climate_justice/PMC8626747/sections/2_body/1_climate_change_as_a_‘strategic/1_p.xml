Both have played leading roles in the decision-making processes of climate agreements, although often in different positions and adopting contrasting trajectories: one, critical to a Western liberal international order, acting together with G-77 and not automatically adhering to commitments or procedures (Moreira and Ribeiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>); the other, consistently supporting a pro-climate agenda and actively addressing norms and responsibilities.</p>
