Instead of proposals to restore and strengthen small-scale food provision through public supports, the &#8216;solutions&#8217; approved by MSs at the 2008 Conference included increasing productivity through private sector value chains, emissions trading and offsets, agrofuels, synthetic biology and WTO market-based governance of agriculture (Canfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>).
