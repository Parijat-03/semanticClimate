<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The CCHH ECHO curriculum deliberately included both broad and more narrowly
focused elements critical for health professionals to best understand the
relationship between CCHH. The postsession survey and Zoom poll results suggest
that the majority of participants increased their knowledge and confidence in
the topics presented. They also reported that they plan to change their practice
based on the information learned in the CCHH ECHO sessions. Specifically, they
plan to communicate more with their patients, applying the knowledge they have
learned and the tools they have gained.</p>
