This allows us to modify Kabeer&#8217;s simple linear model with a more complex version (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The two-way arrows symbolise what will become increasingly systemic iterations between agency, resources and achievements as feedback loops are set in motion. The challenge for agricultural research organisations and their partners is to feed into and reinforce these feedback loops in a positive way that speaks to the &#8220;power to&#8221; and &#8220;power with&#8221; forms of agency that we have described.
