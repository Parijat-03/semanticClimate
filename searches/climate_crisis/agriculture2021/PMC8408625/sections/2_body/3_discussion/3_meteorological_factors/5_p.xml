<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0185">Our results also show that higher regional summer surface water extent for a given year, is negatively associated with WNV and is one of the strongest predictors of WNV incidence. This was not an expected finding, since we would expected higher levels of surface water to be positively correlated with WNV incidence because of the extra water resources available to mosquitoes. However, it may be explained by the fact that sometimes desiccation of water resources can bring mosquito and bird hosts closer together, increasing transmission potential and therefore the prevalence of the virus <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This was also a major finding in a recent study by Paull et al., 2017 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, who reported that drought was closely linked to the intensity of outbreaks for a given year in the United States. Another explanation for this result is that with higher surface water extent, there may be more flooding and fast water movement, which may wash away mosquito eggs and larvae <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. This, along with increases in surface water may also inhibit contact between birds, mosquitoes and humans <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is important to note that this variable probably does not capture the creation of short-term water resources created by rainfall (e.g. pools, puddles), which can be used as breeding habitat by mosquitoes. It rather captures long term and large water surface such as deltas, lakes, and flood plains.</p>
