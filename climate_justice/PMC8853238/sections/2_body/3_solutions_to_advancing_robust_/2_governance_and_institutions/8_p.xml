Often credited for their innovative climate programming, these efforts are experiments that can be up-scaled and adopted by state governments (Kern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). However, such innovation can be risky when it occurs in conservative states hostile to climate objectives. In these venues, local-state conflict often plays out via state preemption laws, which revoke local authority to act on certain issues or in certain manners (e.g., fracking restrictions and electricity provider choice) that results in stifling local policy innovation (Riverstone-Newell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2017</xref>).</p>
