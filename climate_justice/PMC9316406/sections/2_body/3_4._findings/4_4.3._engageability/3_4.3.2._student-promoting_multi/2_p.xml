These programs not only address the school students and their families&#8217; immediate needs (e.g., emergency response skills, food, and parents&#8217; re-employment efforts) but also contribute to students&#8217; physical health (e.g., nutrition and physical activity) and mental health needs (e.g., opportunity to extend their social networks and the general public&#8217;s education of holistic wellness). The cross-sector community engagement during the non-disaster period builds the community&#8217;s coping capacity for future extreme events. Social work endeavors can enhance the schools&#8217; community hub position for community development, supporting the students, their families, and other extended community members&#8217; holistic wellness. </p>
