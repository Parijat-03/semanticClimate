To do this we compute the cumulative impacts of temperature anomaly above the historical norms over the period 1981&#8211;2010. We use data from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), merged with SSP2-RCP4.5 (considered a &#8220;middle of the road&#8221; scenario) runs of twelve GCMs from CMIP6. The counterfactual impact of climate change on food insecurity is derived by comparing the outputs from Equation <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref> of region <italic>i</italic> over these two scenarios. We consider the effects of sub-national region-specific average annual temperature increases over the 2014&#8211;2019 period compared to the baseline scenario (1981&#8211;2010) under which temperature in each&#160;region increases according to its historical trend.</p>
