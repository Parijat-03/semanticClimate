The city/state of Mumbai published a climate report .
`pyamihtml` can convert this automatically. Decide where you want to output to go (here `delhi`)
```

pyamihtml IPCC --input  https://data.opencity.in/dataset/56a1dec3-4f7b-41c3-b89d-8c7d52feb5a8/resource/3b789b78-5a98-4e30-b80b-08da2028b005/download/mumbai-climate-action-plan-2022.pdf --outdir mumbai
```

This will create tables automatically (they may not be complete)
