In the children's networks, doctors play the most important role in social networks for COVID&#8208;19. For instance, Amalina who is a general surgeon in London ranks first, and Zo&#235; Hyde who is a doctor at the University of Western Medical School places second. Also, Kerryn Phelps who is one of Australia's best&#8208;known doctors takes ninth. Next, Organisations play the second important role in the networks among top key players.
