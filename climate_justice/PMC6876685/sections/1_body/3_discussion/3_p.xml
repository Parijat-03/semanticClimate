Compared to surveys of the general US population, the students who participated in our survey arrived in the course with better&#8208;than&#8208;average acceptance and understanding of climate change (Leiserowitz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Before the course module, 98% of these students already agreed that climate change is occurring. Thus, even prior to instruction in this course, participants' responses indicated greater acceptance of climate change than students in a recent survey of American college students&#8212;75% acceptance (Wachholz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>)&#8212;and more than the general American public&#8212;70% acceptance (Leiserowitz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Study participants were also much more likely than the general American adult population to correctly identify that the scientific consensus is that humans are primarily responsible for climate change: 62% of participants recognized this at the beginning of the course, versus just 27% of US adults in a general survey (Pew Research Center, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).</p>
