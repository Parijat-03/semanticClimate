In addition, boreal, temperate and tropical forestation have been tested separately. Both biophysical and biogeochemical effects were accounted for. The net simulated impact of forestation was a cooling varying from &#8211;0.04&#176;C to &#8211;0.45&#176;C, depending on the location and magnitude of the additional forest cover. It was, however, quite marginal compared to the large global warming resulting from anthropogenic GHG emissions (+3&#176;C at the end of the 21st century). In their experiment, forestation in boreal regions led to biophysical warming and biogeochemical cooling that compensated each other, whereas forestation in the tropics led to both biophysical and biogeochemical cooling. The authors concluded that tropical forestation is three times more effective at cooling down climate than boreal or temperate forestation. </span></div><div left="323.73" right="363.15" top="387.6"><span style="x0: 323.73; x1: 328.83; y0: 387.6; y1: 397.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.73" y0="387.6" x1="363.15">Conclusion</span></div><div left="323.73" right="571.8" top="363.6"><span style="x0: 323.73; x1: 326.02; y0: 363.6; y1: 373.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.73" y0="363.6" x1="571.8">In conclusion, planting trees will always result in capturing more atmospheric CO</span><span style="x0: 382.17; x1: 385.36; y0: 350.21; y1: 356.86; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="382.17" y0="350.21" x1="385.36">2</span><span style="x0: 385.36; x1: 387.64; y0: 351.52; y1: 361.02; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="385.36" y0="351.52" x1="571.75">, and thus will mean annual cooling of the globe (</span><span style="x0: 326.36; x1: 330.41; y0: 339.53; y1: 349.03; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="326.36" y0="339.53" x1="400.41">very high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 400.41; x1: 403.05; y0: 339.53; y1: 349.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="400.41" y0="339.53" x1="571.78">).
