<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this study, we seek to provide a detailed understanding of thermal inequities within urban regions both at high risk from heat (due to very hot summers) and containing many low-income and non-White neighborhoods. We chose to develop a comprehensive sample of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the Southwestern U.S. states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and used a more fine-grained geographical scale (the census block group) than previous studies. Phoenix, Arizona, is already heavily represented in the literature on UHI studies, but the remaining 19 urban regions are far less studied. To develop a well-rounded understanding of thermal inequities, we analyzed temperature&#8211;demographic relationships on average hot days, extreme heat days, and at nighttime.</p>
