      <td>Improved grazing land management is a collection\nof practices consisting of a) management of vegetation:\nincluding improved grass varieties/sward composition,\ndeep rooting grasses, increased productivity, and nutrient\nmanagement, b) animal management: including\nappropriate stocking densities fit to carrying capacity,\nfodder banks, and fodder diversification, and c) fire\nmanagement: improved use of fire for sustainable\ngrassland management, including fire prevention\nand improved prescribed burning (see also fire\nmanagement as a separate response option)\n(Table 6.8).</td>
      <td>Improved grazing land management can increase soil\ncarbon sinks, reduce GHG emissions, improve the resilience\nof grazing lands to future climate change, help reduce\ndesertification and land degradation by optimising stocking\ndensity and reducing overgrazing, and can enhance food\nsecurity through improved productivity.</td>

      <td>Improved livestock\nmanagement</td>
      <td>Improved livestock management is a collection of\npractices consisting of a) improved feed and dietary\nadditives (e.g., bioactive compounds, fats), used to\nincrease productivity and reduce emissions from\nenteric fermentation; b) breeding (e.g., breeds with\nhigher productivity or reduced emissions from enteric\nfermentation), c) herd management, including decreasing\nneo-natal mortality, improving sanitary conditions,\nanimal health and herd renewal, and diversifying animal\nspecies, d) emerging technologies (of which some are\nnot legally authorised in several countries) such as\npropionate enhancers, nitrate and sulphate supplements,\narchaea inhibitors and archaeal vaccines, methanotrophs,\nacetogens, defaunation of the rumen, bacteriophages\nand probiotics, ionophores/antibiotics; and e) improved\nmanure management, including manipulation of bedding\nand storage conditions, anaerobic digesters; biofilters,\ndietary change and additives, soil-applied and animal-fed\nnitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, fertiliser type, rate\nand timing, manipulation of manure application practices,\nand grazing management.</td>
      <td>Improved livestock management can reduce GHG\nemissions, particularly from enteric methane and manure\nmanagement. It can improve the resilience of livestock\nproduction systems to climate change by breeding better\nadapted livestock. It can help with desertification and\nland degradation, e.g., through use of more efficient\nand adapted breeds to allow reduced stocking densities.\nImproved livestock sector productivity can also increase\nfood production.</td>

It could reduce pressure on\nland, benefitting desertification, land degradation, food\nsecurity and household income. However, the potential\nto achieve household food security is influenced by the\nmarket orientation of a household, livestock ownership,\nnon-agricultural employment opportunities, and available\nland resources.</td>

      <td>Reduced grassland\nconversion to\ncropland</td>
      <td>Grasslands can be converted to croplands by ploughing\nof grassland and seeding with crops. Since croplands\nhave a lower soil carbon content than grasslands and\nare also more prone to erosion than grasslands, reducing\nconversion of grassland to croplands will prevent soil\ncarbon losses by oxidation and soil loss through erosion.\nThese processes can be reduced if the rate of grassland\nconversion to cropland is reduced.</td>
      <td>Stabilising soils by retaining grass cover also improves\nresilience, benefitting adaptation, desertification and land\ndegradation. Since conversion of grassland to cropland\nusually occurs to remedy food security challenges, food\nsecurity could be adversely affected, since more land is\nrequired to produce human food from livestock products\non grassland than from crops on cropland.</td>
