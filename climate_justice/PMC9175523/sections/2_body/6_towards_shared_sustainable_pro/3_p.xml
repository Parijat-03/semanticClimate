For warming of 2&#160;&#176;C, the carbon intensity of the global economy would need to be reduced to 0.19, 0.16 and 0.13 (kg per PPP $ of GDP) under no growth, 2.5% growth and 4.5% growth scenarios respectively. These figures stand in contrast to the 2019 figure of ~&#8201;0.28 (kg per PPP $ of GDP), starkly illustrating the level of decarbonisation required across the global economy by 2030.</p>
