From study to representation to design, the term \"landscape practice\" is used to describe a way of positioning environments as both subject and object of concern. While monsoons are constituents of many geographies, dynamics, materials and experiences, this paper focuses on the South Asian monsoon and its relationship with the Tibetan Plateau. In this region, freshwater resources are dependent on the monsoon; however, as rising global temperatures and rapid urban development significantly impact the behavior of the monsoon and the Plateau's ability to store freshwater, the monsoon-as a kinetic body of freshwater-becomes the focal point of visual media productions and extractive technologies that require a shifting of perspective from one that privileges land to one that centers the atmosphere. The inclusion of meteorological and atmospheric material and dynamics within the space of landscape practice, constructively challenges the spatial discipline's engagement with exploitable resources; and the monsoon provides a tangible site and set of conditions that is in urgent need of this exploration.", "affiliation": "Royal College of Art, UK.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "European Research Council", "acronym": "ERC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "679873", "agency": "European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "679873", "agency": "European Research Council", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Monsoon", "Tibetan Plateau", "Landscape", "Landscape architecture", "Environmental Design"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/2373566X.2021.1929384"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8372289"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8372289?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-08-23", "firstIndexDate": "2021-08-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-08-20", "dateOfRevision": "2021-08-24", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-07-14", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-07-14"}
