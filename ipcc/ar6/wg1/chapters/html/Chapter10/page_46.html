The propagation and potential accumulation of uncertainties along the chain has been termed the cascade of uncertainty (Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Even within one model, like a&#160;global model, uncertainty propagates across scales. From a&#160;process point of view, these uncertainties are related to forcings and global climate sensitivity, and errors in the representation of the large-scale circulation (Section&#160;10.3.3.3; McNeall et&#160;al., 2016) and regional processes (Section&#160;10.3.3.4), feedbacks (Section&#160;10.3.3.5) and drivers (Section&#160;10.3.3.6). From a&#160;modelling point of view, these uncertainties are related to the choice of dynamical and statistical models (Section&#160;10.3.1) and experimental design (Section&#160;10.3.2). The overall uncertainty can be statistically decomposed into the individual sources (Evin et&#160;al., 2019; Christensen and Kjellstr&#246;m, 2020), although there might be non-linear dependencies between&#160;them.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="402.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="402.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.36; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Uncertainty propagation often increases the spread in regional climate projections when comparing global model and downscaled results, which has been used as an argument against top-down approaches to climate information (Prudhomme et&#160;al., 2010). Increased spread in the modelling chain may also arise from a&#160;more comprehensive representation of previously unknown or underrepresented uncertainties (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). The increased spread in this case goes together with a&#160;better representation of processes and thus an increased model fitness-for-purpose (Section&#160;10.3.3.9).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="246.48" top="282.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="282.48" x1="246.48" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 282.48; y1: 292.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.4.2 Representing and Reducing Uncertainties</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="258.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="258.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.84; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate response uncertainties (Chapter&#160;1) can be represented by multi-model ensembles, although the sampled uncertainty typically underestimates the full range of uncertainty (Collins et&#160;al., 2013b; Shepherd et&#160;al., 2018; Almazroui et&#160;al., 2021). Traditionally, climate response uncertainty has been characterized by the ensemble spread around the multi-model mean change. The change has then further been qualified in terms of the agreement across models and compared to estimates of internal climate variability (Collins et&#160;al., 2013b). Since AR5, several limitations of this approach have been identified (Madsen et&#160;al., 2017) such as the failure to address physically plausible, but low-likelihood, high-impact scenarios (Chapters 1, 4, 8 and 9; Sutton, 2018) or that qualitatively different or even opposite changes may be equally plausible at the regional scale (Shepherd, 2014). In a&#160;multi-model mean these different responses would be lumped together, strongly dampened, and qualified as non-robust, whereas in fact high impacts might occur. Further, the multi-model mean itself is often implausible because it is a&#160;statistical construct (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017).

A&#160;special class of such storylines attempts to attribute regional uncertainties to uncertainties in remote drivers. For instance, the Dutch Meteorological Service has presented climate projections for the Netherlands for different plausible changes of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and different levels of European warming (van den Hurk et&#160;al., 2014). Manzini et&#160;al. (2014) have quantified the impact of uncertainties in tropical upper troposphere warming, polar amplification, and stratospheric wind change on Northern Hemisphere winter climate change. Based on these results, Zappa and Shepherd (2017) separated the multi-model ensemble into physically consistent sub-groups or storylines of qualitatively different projections in relevant remote drivers of the atmospheric circulation. In a&#160;similar vein, (Ose et&#160;al., 2020) trace uncertainties in projections of the East Asian summer monsoon and Mindlin et&#160;al. (2020) conditioned the response of Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude circulation and precipitation to greenhouse gas forcing on large-scale climate indicators (Section&#160;8.4.2.9.2).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="426.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="426.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 426.6; y1: 436.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">These physical climate storylines help to physically explain contradicting regional projections and thus make the conveyed information a&#160;better representation of the true uncertainty (Hewitson et al., 2014a). Additionally, the attribution of regional uncertainties to drivers may in principle help reduce uncertainty in the case where some storylines can be ruled out because the projected changes in the driving processes appear to be physically implausible (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017).

The idea is to link the spread in climate model projections via regression to the spread in present climate model biases for relevant driving processes. Models with lower biases are assigned higher weight in the projections, which in turn reduces the spread of the projections in a&#160;physical way and may additionally reduce projection uncertainty. For instance, Simpson et&#160;al. (2016) have reduced the spread in projections of North American winter hydroclimate by linking this spread to model biases in the representation of relevant stationary wave patterns. Other examples of using emergent constraints in a&#160;regional context are Brown et&#160;al. (2016), G. Li et&#160;al. (2017), Giannini and Kaplan (2019), Ose (2019) and Zhou et&#160;al.
