Given the disproportionately greater negative impact of the pandemic and its containment measures on already disadvantaged groups, a democratic discourse on its distributional effects remains an urgent desideratum. As in the case of the climate crisis, many governments selected measures that caused a particular strain on younger generations, those in precarious living and working conditions and on women in care relationships&#8212;a result that could have been predicted from the underrepresentation of these groups in parties and parliaments. In Germany, the observation that car dealers were allowed to open before schools caused some outcry and derision in the first wave of the pandemic, but did not prevent governments from closing schools again for more than six months throughout the second and third wave. As examples like neighbouring France show, the same degree of containment could well have been achieved by different combinations of measures, such as stricter curfews or obligatory requirements to work from home&#8212;measures that would of course have taken a higher toll on different groups and interests.</p>
