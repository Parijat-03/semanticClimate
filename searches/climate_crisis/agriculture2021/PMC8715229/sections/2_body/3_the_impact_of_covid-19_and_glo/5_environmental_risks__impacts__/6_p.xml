This has resulted in some immediate, tangible impacts. For example, the deforestation rate of the Amazon rainforest in April 2020 was 64% higher than in April 2019; the first three months of 2020 saw 50% higher deforestation rates than in the same period of 2019.<xref rid="fn0035" ref-type="fn">7</xref>
Increased logging activities have also been observed in other regions since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in countries such as Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Madagascar, and Nepal.<xref rid="fn0040" ref-type="fn">8</xref>
While COVID-19 pandemic was underway, growing fishing pressure in many Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was observed. Illegal fishing by supertrawlers increased substantially in marine protected areas MPAs like the Galapagos Archipelago. In many nearshore MPAs people who lost tourism livelihoods had to fall back on fishing. Lost livelihoods and uncertain food security intensified illegal extractive activities including fishing in no-take area or using illegal fishing gears (<xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Phua et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
