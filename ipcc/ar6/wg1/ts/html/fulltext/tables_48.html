      <td>Carbon sinks for anthropogenic CO are associated with mainly physical ocean and biospheric land processes that drive the exchange\n2\nof carbon between multiple land, ocean and atmospheric reservoirs. These exchanges are driven by increasing atmospheric CO, but\n2\nare modulated by changes in climate (Box TS.5, Figure 1c,d). The Northern and Southern Hemispheres dominate the land and ocean\nsinks, respectively (Box TS.5, Figure 1). Ocean circulation and thermodynamic processes also play a critical role in coupling the global\ncarbon and energy (heat) cycles. There is high confidence that this ocean carbon&#8211;heat nexus is an important basis for one of the\nmost important carbon&#8211;climate metrics, the transient climate response to cumulative CO emissions (TCRE; Section TS.3.2.1) used to\n2\ndetermine the remaining carbon budget. {5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3}</td>

      <td>Based on multiple lines of evidence using interhemispheric gradients of CO concentrations, isotopes, and inventory data, it is\n2\nunequivocal that the growth in CO in the atmosphere since 1750 (see Section TS.2.2) is due to the direct emissions from human\n2\nactivities. The combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change for the period 1750&#8211;2019 resulted in the release of 700 &#177; 75 PgC (likely\nrange, 1 PgC = 1015 g of carbon) to the atmosphere, of which about 41% &#177; 11% remains in the atmosphere today (high confidence).\nOf the total anthropogenic CO emissions, the combustion of fossil fuels was responsible for about 64% &#177; 15%, growing to an 86% &#177;\n2\n14% contribution over the past 10 years. The remainder resulted from land-use change. During the last decade (2010&#8211;2019), average\nannual anthropogenic CO emissions reached the highest levels in human history at 10.9 &#177; 0.9 PgC yr&#8211;1 (high confidence). Of these\n2\nemissions, 46% accumulated in the atmosphere (5.1 &#177; 0.02 PgC yr&#8211;1), 23% (2.5 &#177; 0.6 PgC yr&#8211;1) was taken up by the ocean and 31%\n(3.4 &#177; 0.9 PgC yr&#8211;1) was removed by terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence). {5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3}</td>

      <td>The ocean (high confidence) and land (medium confidence) sinks of CO have increased with anthropogenic emissions over the past\n2\nsix decades (Box TS.5, Figure 1). This coherence between emissions and the growth in ocean and land sinks has resulted in the airborne\nfraction of anthropogenic CO remaining at 44 &#177; 10% over the past 60 years (high confidence). Interannual and decadal variability of\n2\nthe ocean and land sinks indicate that they are sensitive to changes in the growth rate of emissions as well as climate variability and\nare therefore also sensitive to climate change (high confidence). {5.2.1}</td>

      <td>The land CO sink is driven by carbon uptake by vegetation, with large interannual variability, for example, linked to the El Ni&#241;o&#8211;\n2\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). Since the 1980s, carbon fertilization from rising atmospheric CO has increased the strength of the net\n2\nland CO sink (medium confidence). During the historical period, the growth of the ocean sink has been primarily determined by\n2\nthe growth rate of atmospheric CO. However, there is medium confidence that changes to physical and chemical processes in the\n2\nocean and in the land biosphere, which govern carbon feedbacks, are already modifying the characteristics of variability, particularly\nthe seasonal cycle of CO, in both the ocean and land. However, changes to the multi-decadal trends in the sinks have not yet been\n2\nobserved. {2.3.4, 3.6.1, 5.2.1}</td>

      <td>In AR6, ESM projections are assessed with CO concentrations by 2100 from about 400 ppm (SSP1-1.9) to above 1100 ppm (SSP5-8.5).\n2\nMost simulations are performed with prescribed atmospheric CO concentrations, which already account for a central estimate of\n2\nclimate&#8211;carbon feedback effects. Carbon dioxide emissions-driven simulations account for uncertainty in these feedbacks, but do\nnot significantly change the projected global surface temperature changes (high confidence). Although land and ocean sinks absorb\nmore CO under high emissions than low emissions scenarios, the fraction of emissions removed from the atmosphere decreases\n2\n(high confidence). This means that the more CO that is emitted, the less efficient the ocean and land sinks become (high confidence),\n2\nan effect which compensates for the logarithmic relationship between CO and its radiative forcing, which means that for each unit\n2\nincrease in additional atmospheric CO the effect on global temperature decreases.

      <td>Ocean and land sinks show similar responses for a given scenario, but the land sink has a much higher interannual variability\nand wider model spread. Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, the initial growth of both sinks in response to increasing atmospheric\nconcentrations of CO is subsequently limited by emerging carbon&#8211;climate feedbacks (high confidence) (Box TS.5, Figure 1f).\n2\nProjections show that the ocean and land sinks will stop growing from the second part of the 21st century under all emissions\nscenarios, but with different drivers for different emissions scenarios. Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, the weakening growth rate\nof the ocean CO sink in the second half of the century is primarily linked to the strengthening positive feedback from reduced\n2\ncarbonate buffering capacity, ocean warming and altered ocean circulation (e.g., AMOC changes). In contrast, for SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6\nand SSP2-4.5, the weakening growth rate of the ocean carbon sink is a response to the stabilizing or declining atmospheric\nCO concentrations. Under SSP1-1.9, models project that combined land and ocean sinks will turn into a weak source by 2100\n2\n(medium confidence). Under high CO emissions scenarios, it is very likely that the land carbon sink will grow more slowly due to\n2\nwarming and drying from the mid-21st century, but it is very unlikely that it will switch from being a sink to a source before 2100.</td>
