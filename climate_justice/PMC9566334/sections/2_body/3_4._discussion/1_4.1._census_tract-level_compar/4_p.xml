In the 90th percentile of SUHI intensity, 12.91%, 14.81%, and 12.72% of Black, Hispanic, and Asian study participants, respectively, reside. By comparison, only 5.43% of the White population in the study inhabit areas equal to or in excess of the 90th percentile in SUHI intensity. These numbers fundamentally triple when examining the 75th percentile. The coolest, 5th, percentile examined, includes 6.32% of White persons in the study compared to 2.09% Black, 3.1% Hispanic, and 7.17% Asian persons. The fact that the Asian percentage is higher in this percentile conceivably illustrates some of the complexities of Asian socioeconomic statuses in the U.S. [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. If the Asian variable was more stratified, (i.e., split into countries or regions of origin such as East Asia or South Asia, as is sure to come in future census data releases) examining this outcome in more depth would be possible.</p>
