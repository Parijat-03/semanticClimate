Perhaps this provides the rationale for the recent diversification of the operations of Alexkor (SOE) into fossil fuel exploration. As indicated on the entity&#8217;s website, the diversification is to ensure a continuous supply of 60-million tons of coal needed by Eskom per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This high consumption ultimately makes the country&#8217;s energy sector the most coal-dependent of the G20 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. As a consequence, although the energy sector makes a significant contribution to economic advancement, its high coal consumption poses a considerable threat to the environment and gravely interferes with the rights to life, health, and survival of youth. Begging the question, what action is suitable for capping state-owned entities&#8217; (SOEs) GHGs?</p>
