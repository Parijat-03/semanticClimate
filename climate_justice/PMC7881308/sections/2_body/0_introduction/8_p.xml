I then argue that in responding to such needs, clinics will be best served by adhering to their pedagogical principles in the design of new services and in reshaping existing practices, while recognising the crucial social justice dimensions of their work. I identify a range of hallmarks of effective clinic-based learning and suggest practices that can be used to maintain these hallmarks. I suggest that the experience of clinic students should be different but still distinctive.</p>
