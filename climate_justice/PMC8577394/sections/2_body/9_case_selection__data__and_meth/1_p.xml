Data for this paper come from three years of participant observation, from March 2018 to February 2021, in the ESCR planning process. For this article I draw on city-led public meetings and hearings, community organization-led meetings, marches, protests, and other events convened under the auspice of the infrastructure project and the label of climate resilience more broadly. The article also draws on a snowball sample of in-depth interviews and informal conversations with public housing residents, tenant leaders, park and environmental activists, residents in market housing, urban planners and other staff in various city agencies and private firms, engineers, journalists, and consultants working on the project in varying capacities. I also collected and analyzed publicly-available reports and technical documents related to the project, as well as local and national news media articles dating back to the early stages of design in 2013.</p>
