<italic>Rising&#8217;s</italic> three sections lay out the story of climate change and how it impacts different parts of society. Grounded in a blend of reporting and creative non-fiction, each section features a mix between dispatches (explanations about the climate crisis &#8220;reported&#8221; from various locations) and first-person accounts of how climate change has impacted citizens in their everyday lives. Through this marrying of reporting and storytelling that Rush elevates the story of climate change and rising seas from abstract figures, numbers and possibilities into concrete ramifications of how people are already being impacted by the ecological disaster of climate change.</p>
