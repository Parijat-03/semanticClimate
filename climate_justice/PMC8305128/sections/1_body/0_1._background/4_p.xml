In the USA, municipalities with greater chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (particular matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 &#956;m, or PM<sub>2.5</sub>) had a 2 to 15% higher risk of dying from COVID-19 for every microgram per cubic meter increase in this pollutant [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In London, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) were positively correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In 63 Chinese cities, the basic reproductive number was associated with the daily concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In northern Italy, for every microgram per cubic meter increase in chronic exposure (considered the annual average between 2015 and 2019) to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the risk of death from COVID-19 increased by 9% [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A time-series study conducted in India showed that pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were related to daily cases of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In China, short-term exposure (from 0 to 14 days) to air pollutants, such as particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 10 &#956;m (PM<sub>10</sub>), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), was associated with a larger number of confirmed COVID-19 cases [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
