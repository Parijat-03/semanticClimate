<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Some communities are considered vulnerable regardless of the index used. 13.4% (1060) of tracts in the state are vulnerable (75<sup>th</sup> percentile or above) under all three indices despite differences in indicator selection, measurement of those indicators, and calculation methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, disagreement across tracts designated as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; likely results from regional differences in vulnerability across the state as well as differences in the overall focus of the indices. &#8220;Disadvantaged&#8221; designations for tracts vulnerable under all indices point to especially high priority communities, bolstering findings from previous work [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As California uses CES in designation of &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities, 348 tracts that are vulnerable by both SVI and HHAI are not counted as state-designated &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities. There are 429 communities that are currently eligible to receive funds for &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities that are vulnerable under CES alone. This number represents 21.6% of the tracts currently considered &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; by the state of California.</p>
