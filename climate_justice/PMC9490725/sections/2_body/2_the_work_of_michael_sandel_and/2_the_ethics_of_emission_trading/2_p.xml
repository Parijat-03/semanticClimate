(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>) summarised all of these positions and authors, including Sandel. Drawing also on Caney and Page, they identify five objections, split into two groups. The first group is the commodity-centred objections, divided into the &#8216;non-ownership argument&#8217; and &#8216;the price argument&#8217;, which object to commodifying or putting a price on something that should not be priced, in this case the environment. The second group is the person-centred objections, divided into &#8216;the crowding-out argument&#8217;, &#8216;the fine/fee argument&#8217; and &#8216;the civic responsibility argument&#8217;. The market proponents conclude that all the practical objections about unfair or undesirable outcomes (e.g. fraud, offsets, financialisation, negative impact on developing countries) can be dealt with by improving the design of the system (e.g. auction rather than free permits, a price floor, limiting financialisation, protecting developing countries). More crucially for the discussion in this paper, such authors continually define the moral objections as out of scope, insisting that the trading system is only a means to an end and does not ascribe value, thus ignoring the examples given by Sandel and others of how markets do influence values.</p>
