<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Many of the groups that have been identified as most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change have emerged as being equally vulnerable to the most deleterious effects of COVID&#8208;19. This overlap occurs with certain communities of color, indigenous populations, the very young, and older adults as well as people with chronic medical and psychiatric illness and those with disabilities (CDC,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The same long&#8208;standing health inequities and structural inequalities that have led vulnerable groups to experience climate injustice are contributing to higher rates of COVID&#8208;19, hospitalization rates, and death particularly among racial and ethnic minorities (CDC,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). For instance, as of June 2020, the CDC (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) reported that age&#8208;adjusted hospitalization rates were highest among non&#8208;Hispanic American Indian or Alaska native and non&#8208;Hispanic Black persons.</p>
