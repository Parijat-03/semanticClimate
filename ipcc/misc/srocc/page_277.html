Bush encroachment is observed over a&#160;fairly wide area of grasslands in the western United States, including Jornada Basin within the Chihuahuan Desert, and is spreading at a&#160;fast rate despite grazing restrictions intended to curb the spread (Yanoff and Muldavin 2008; Browning and Archer 2011; Van Auken 2009; Rachal et al. 2012).

Bisigato and Laphitz (2009) identi&#64257;ed overgrazing as a&#160;cause of deserti&#64257;cation in the Patagonian Monte region of Argentina. Vieira et al. (2015) found that 94% of northeast Brazilian drylands were susceptible to deserti&#64257;cation. It is estimated that up to 50% of the area was being degraded due to frequent prolonged droughts and clearing of forests for agriculture. This land-use change threatens the extinction of around 28 native species (Leal et al. 2005). In Central Chile, dryland forest and shrubland area was reduced by&#160;1.7% and&#160;0.7%, respectively, between 1975 and 2008 (Schulz et al. 2010).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="226.06" top="183.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 183.42; y1: 193.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="183.42" x1="226.06">1.2.2 Attribution of deserti&#64257;cation</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="159.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 159.52; y1: 169.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="159.52" x1="313.27">Deserti&#64257;cation is a&#160;result of complex interactions within coupled social-ecological systems. Thus, the relative contributions of climatic, anthropogenic and other drivers of deserti&#64257;cation vary depending on speci&#64257;c socio-economic and ecological contexts. The high natural climate variability in dryland regions is a&#160;major cause of vegetation changes but does not necessarily imply degradation. Drought is not degradation as the land productivity may return entirely once the drought ends (Kassas 1995).

Global applications of RUE trends to attribute degradation to climate or other (largely human) causes have been performed by Bai et al. (2008) and Le et al. (2016) (Section&#160;3.2.1.1). The RESTREND (residual trend) method analyses the correlation between annual maximum NDVI (or other vegetation index as a&#160;proxy for NPP) and precipitation by testing accumulation and lag periods for the precipitation (Evans and Geerken 2004). The identi&#64257;ed relationship with the highest correlation represents the maximum amount of vegetation variability that can be explained by the precipitation, and corresponding RUE values can be calculated. Using this relationship, the climate component of the NDVI time series can be reconstructed, and the difference between this and the original time series (the residual) is attributed to anthropogenic and other causes. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="327.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.93; y0: 327.55; y1: 337.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="327.55" x1="571.74">The RESTREND method, or minor variations of it, have been applied extensively. Herrmann and Hutchinson (2005) concluded that climate was the dominant causative factor for widespread greening in the Sahel region from 1982&#8211;2003, and anthropogenic and other factors were mostly producing land improvements or no change. However, pockets of deserti&#64257;cation were identi&#64257;ed in Nigeria and Sudan. Similar results were also found from 1982&#8211;2007 by Huber et al. (2011). Wessels et al. (2007) applied RESTREND to South Africa and showed that RESTREND produced a&#160;more accurate identi&#64257;cation of degraded land than RUE alone. RESTREND identi&#64257;ed a&#160;smaller area undergoing deserti&#64257;cation due to non-climate causes compared to the NDVI trends. Liu et al. (2013) extended the climate component of RESTREND to include temperature and applied this to VOD observations of the cold drylands of Mongolia. They found the area undergoing deserti&#64257;cation due to non-climatic causes is much smaller than the area with negative VOD trends. RESTREND has also been applied in several other studies to the Sahel (Leroux et al. 2017), Somalia (Omuto et al. 2010), West Africa (Ibrahim et al. 2015), China (Li et al. 2012; Yin et al. 2014), Central Asia (Jiang et al. 2017), Australia (Burrell et al. 2017) and globally (Andela et al. 2013). In each of these studies the extent to which deserti&#64257;cation can be attributed to climate versus other causes varies across the landscape.</span></div></body></html>
