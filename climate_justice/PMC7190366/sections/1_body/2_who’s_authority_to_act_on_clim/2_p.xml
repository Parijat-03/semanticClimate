Specifically, a public health emergency of international concern is &#8220;an extraordinary event which is determined ... to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response,&#8221;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> where event &#8220;means a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease.&#8221;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In practice, therefore, public health emergencies have been declared only for infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent outbreak of covid-19.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
