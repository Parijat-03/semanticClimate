The labeled arrows highlight the most eminent phases or sub-processes of the combined normative system&#8217;s dynamics. We call these processes dynamic because they feature different temporal qualities of change across different processes. To differentiate these temporal qualities is crucial to a systemic understanding of sustainability problems and processes (Weiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>; Sarriot and Kouletio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Grunwald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>; Cash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). Process a is called techno-scientific acceleration in &#8220;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Acceleration and centralization of change</xref>&#8221; section while b and c are called socio-ethical deceleration in &#8220;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Deceleration and decentralization of change</xref>&#8221; section. The meso-level is thus the center of a dynamic socio-scientific system including global indicators and accounting practices as well as individual responsible action.</p>
