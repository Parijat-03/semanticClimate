In many countries, hierarchical social norms relating to gender and social status also impede young people&#8217;s ability to hold their elders and those in power to account. Young people often lack support from lawyers and civil society, and don&#8217;t always have the legal standing, to file lawsuits. To these challenges are added the legal difficulties of establishing a direct causal link between climate change and the violation of citizens&#8217; rights, including the right to health.<sup><xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> However, as science and medicine continue to advance our understanding of the connections between environmental conditions and health, the centrality of young people to climate change accountability, and their standing to pursue legal proceedings in cases concerning climate change, will only increase.</p>
