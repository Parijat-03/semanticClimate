A &#8216;whole person, whole community, whole of life, and whole of planet&#8217; [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] approach&#8212;which seeks to promote the health and wellbeing of people in the context of their own lives and communities&#8212;was used. This approach also reflects Indigenous insights into wellness which underscore the fundamental importance of relationships with self, family, community, nature, and spirit [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reflecting research and policy formation mandates in the Canadian context, our research was also informed by the principles of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI), Gender Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) and Cultural Safety. As a result, intersectionality theory was used to ensure that this research considers the realities of a diversity of children/youth and to conduct an analysis that acknowledges their heterogeneous social identities, social locations, and social experiences [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These approaches are valued as they deepened our scholarship on the intergenerational justice dimensions of the interplay between Anthropogenically driven climate change, children and youth, and their mental health and wellbeing.</p>
