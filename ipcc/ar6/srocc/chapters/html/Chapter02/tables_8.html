      <td>In mountain regions, surface air temperature generally tends to decrease with increasing elevation thus directly impacting how much\nof the precipitation falls as snow as opposed to rain. Therefore, changes in air temperature have different consequences for snow\ncover, permafrost and glaciers at different elevations. A number of studies have reported that trends in air temperature vary with\nelevation, a phenomenon referred to as elevation dependent warming (EDW; Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein), with potential\nconsequences beyond those of uniform warming. EDW does not imply that warming is larger at higher elevation, and smaller at lower\nelevation, but it means that the warming rate (e.g., in &#186;C per decade) is not the same across all elevation bands. Although this concept\nhas received wide attention in recent years, the manifestation of EDW varies by region, season and temperature indicator (e.g., daily\nmean, minimum or maximum temperature), meaning that a uniform pattern does not exist. The identification of the underlying driving\nmechanisms for EDW and how they combine is complex.</td>

      <td>Several physical processes contribute to EDW, and quantifying their relative contributions has remained largely elusive (Minder et al.,\n2018; Palazzi et al., 2019). Some of the processes identified are similar to those explaining the amplified warming in the polar regions\n(Chapter 3). For example, the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcing is increased at low temperatures common in both polar and\nmountain environments (Ohmura, 2012). Because the relationship between specific humidity and downwelling radiation is nonlinear,\nin a dry and cold atmosphere found at high elevation, any increase in atmospheric humidity due to temperature increase drives\ndisproportionately large warming (Rangwala et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Snow-albedo feedback plays an important role where the\nsnow cover is in decline (Pepin and Lundquist, 2008; Scherrer et al., 2012), increasing the absorption of solar radiation which in turn\nleads to increased surface air temperature and further snowmelt. Other processes are specific to the mountain environment. Especially\nin the tropics, warming can be enhanced at higher elevation by a reduction of the vertical temperature gradient, due to increased\nlatent heat release above the condensation level, favored in a warmer and moister atmosphere (Held and Soden, 2006). The cooling\neffect of aerosols, which also cause solar dimming, is more pronounced at low elevation and reduced at high elevation (Zeng et al.,\n2015). While many mechanisms suggest that warming should be enhanced at high elevation, observed and simulated EDW patterns\nare usually more complex (Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein). Numerical simulations by global and regional climate models,\nwhich show EDW, need to be considered carefully because of intrinsic limitations due to potentially incomplete understanding and\nimplementation of relevant physical processes, in addition to coarse grid spacing with respect to mountainous topography (M&#233;n&#233;goz\net al., 2014; Winter et al., 2017).</td>
