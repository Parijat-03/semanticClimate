Generally, the Arctic warming pattern has 8 been attributed to a decline in sea-ice, changing atmospheric circulation, and advection of heat and moisture 9 (Dahlke and Maturilli, 2017; Champagne et al., 2019; Clark and Lee, 2019; Hao et al., 2019; Kim and Kim, 10 2019). 11 12 Over the ARCO region, long-term temperature trends and variability are available from Spitsbergen 13 (Svalbard). For the entire period of 1898 to 2012 available at Svalbard Airport, the annual mean warming is 14 2.6&#176;C per century, with the largest trend in spring (3.9&#176;C per century) (Nordli et al., 2014). The winter 15 warming is also large (2.9&#176;C per century) with six of the 10 warmest winters occurring after 2000 (Nordli et 16 al., 2014).

For the longer 1950&#8211;2010 period, a consistent 23 warming is found over central and western NEC, but no trend or no consensus is found over the Labrador 24 coast. The latter is related with cooling of the North Atlantic region during the 1970s. In Northern Europe 25 (NEU), based on the 1914&#8211;2013 period, statistically significant warming trends were found from March to 26 May at all nine stations analysed by (Kivinen et al., 2017) and from September to October at most of them. 27 In particular, this is seen in a significant decrease of extremely cold climate events (10th percentile of mean 28 seasonal temperature) in all seasons and increase of extremely warm climate events particularly in spring and 29 autumn in the recent 1994&#8211;2013 period, compared to earlier 20-year periods. (Saros et al., 2019) showed a 30 step change in summer temperature (2.2&#176;C in June, 1.1&#176;C in July) over west Greenland after the mid-1990s. 31 32 The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) reported Arctic precipitation increases of 1.5&#8211;33 2.0% per decade, with the strongest increase in the cold season (October&#8211;May) (AMAP, 2019). However, 34 annual precipitation trends derived from different reanalyses do not agree, differ in sign and have low 35 significance (Lindsay et al., 2014; Boisvert et al., 2018) (Figure Atlas.48:). Direct precipitation 36 measurements are difficult and include uncertainties, therefore precipitation estimates in the Arctic rely on 37 climate models and reanalyses.  38 39 Based on the &#8216;best&#8217; five CMIP5 model means, the mean annual precipitation in the Arctic (70-90&#176;N; 2006 to 40 2015) is dominated by snowfall, with 65 &#177; 5% of precipitation currently falling in solid form (this model 41 estimate compares to the 68 &#177; 2% from the observationally driven JRA-55 reanalysis) (Bintanja and Andry, 42 2017). However, the estimates of different reanalyses vary largely. According to an estimate of five 43 reanalyses over the 2000&#8211;2010 period, on average, around 40% of the precipitation falls over the entire 44 Arctic Ocean (north of 60&#176;N) as snow (200 mm yr</span><span x0="278.88" y0="221.58" x1="285.93" style="x0: 278.88; x1: 282.39; y0: 221.58; y1: 228.6; width: 3.51; font-size: 7.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">&#8211;1</span><span x0="285.96" y0="216.23" x1="41.44" style="x0: 285.96; x1: 289.61; y0: 216.23; y1: 227.21; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">), with a prominent across-reanalyses standard deviation 45 of 60&#8211;70 mm (Boisvert et al., 2018).

More frequent rainfall events have been 47 reported for example for NEU and ARCO (Svalbard) (Maturilli et al., 2015; AMAP, 2019). Further for 48 NEU, the contribution of heavy daily precipitation amounts to the total precipitation has increased since 49 1950 (Hartmann et al., 2013). 50 51 Observational records (1966 to 2010) for the Russian-Arctic (RAR) region from 517 historical Russian 52 surface weather stations over northern Eurasia show changing precipitation characteristics (Ye et al., 2016), 53 providing values and geographical distribution of mean seasonal precipitation total, frequency, and intensity. 54 Higher precipitation intensity but lower frequency and little change in annual precipitation total occurred.
