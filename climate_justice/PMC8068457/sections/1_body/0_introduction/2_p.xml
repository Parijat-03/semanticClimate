Among this group, there are developing and developed countries, eight of which belong to the EU27. In terms of income level in the World Bank (WB) classification, Syria is classified as a low-income country; Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco are lower-middle-income countries; Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon, Libya, Montenegro, and Turkey are upper-middle-income countries; the remaining 10, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Slovenia, and Spain, are high-income countries (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>). In addition to socioeconomic diversity, some of these countries have suffered or are suffering from severe armed conflicts, and there are humanitarian emergencies in the Mediterranean Sea, such as the current refugee crisis, that highlight the necessity to reinforce cooperation between both sides of the Mediterranean (Albahari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>; Panebianco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p>
