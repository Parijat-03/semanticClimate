Radical, &#8216;out of the box&#8217; thinking and systemic transformations are urgently needed for majority of the world&#8217;s people to be able to live through these times with some measure of equity, justice and dignity. Such transformations need leadership and governance firmly committed to public interest rather than to market powers and capital, and that enable ways forward based on reality-based knowledge and experience, rather than narrow exclusionary science and corporate solutionism. In the face of increasing authoritarianism, violence and shrinking civic space in many countries, multilateralism and international solidarity have acquired additional salience.</p>
