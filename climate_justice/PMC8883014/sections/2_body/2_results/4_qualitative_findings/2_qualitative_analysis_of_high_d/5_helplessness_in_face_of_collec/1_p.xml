Just as the overall population of the survey, they stressed the lack of &#8220;large, structural changes,&#8221; supported by the interests of the few wealthiest actors, such as &#8220;corporations&#8221;, &#8220;states&#8221; and &#8220;top billionaires.&#8221; The selfishness and impunity of such attitudes was stressed by the participants, noting, &#8220;[they] tend to not care because it doesn&#8217;t affect them,&#8221; &#8220;no one is holding them to account&#8221; and &#8220;a fraction of their wealth would be sufficient to almost stop climate change.&#8221;</p>
