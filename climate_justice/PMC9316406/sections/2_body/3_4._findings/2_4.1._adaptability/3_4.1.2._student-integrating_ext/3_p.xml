Unlike micro- and mezzo-level practices, where social work practitioners need to target the clients and communities&#8217; unique requirements, applying an inclusive approach at the macro level informs the related policies and programs by protecting vulnerable and marginalized populations. The learning experience during the global public health emergency strengthens the student&#8217;s comprehension of the intersectionality of social injustices and the societal impacts on clients&#8217; holistic health and well-being. For instance, Black, Indigenous, People of Colour (BIPOC) individuals statistically have shown higher rates of physical illness and death from COVID in North America compared to white counterparts [<xref rid="B66-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. COVID-19-driven racism increased for Asian Americans and Asian Canadians [<xref rid="B67-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Social work anti-oppressive interventions have historically addressed social injustices and have supported vulnerable and marginalized groups [<xref rid="B68-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Social workers&#8217; expertise should be adapted to the contexts of environmental and man-made crises, continually perceiving how these crises specifically cause negative impacts on the health and well-being of the vulnerable and marginalized groups and addressing these issues through macro-level interventions.</p>
