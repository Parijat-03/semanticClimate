      <td>and water filtration, flood control, enhanced soil fertility and reversal of land degradation. Potential adverse side-effects of forest\narea expansion depend largely on the state of the land it displaces as well as tree species selections. Active governance and planning\ncontribute to maximising co-benefits while minimising adverse side-effects (Laestadius et al. 2011; Dinerstein et al. 2015; Veldman\net al. 2017) (Section 4.8 and Chapter 7). At large spatial scales, forest expansion is expected to lead to increased competition for land,\nwith potentially undesirable impacts on food prices, biodiversity, non-forest ecosystems and water availability (Bryan and Crossman\n2013; Boysen et al. 2017; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Egginton et al. 2014; Cao et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2015a; Smith et al. 2013).</td>
