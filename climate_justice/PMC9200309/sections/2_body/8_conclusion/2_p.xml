<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Yet reticence persists. Defence teams can no longer argue against the validity of the science, or ignorance of the link between anthropogenic climate disruption and human health harm. In the context of climate health emergency, it is evident that amplification of decarbonisation efforts is urgently required. Litigation offers a powerful tool to drive multi- sector transition. Given the shortcomings that remain in the widespread use and acceptance of public health claims in legal argumentation used for litigation, we advise that laws and legal incentives are created, which position public health as a central focus. In the interests of future generations, we argue for more funding to be mobilized towards climate-health evidence and further develop this research as a scientific discipline, the promotion of greater public and industry awareness of climate-health links to support more widespread utilization of public health claims in allegations of wrongdoing, and that a legal panel of climate-health experts be devised which can be called upon by plaintiffs to provide expert testimony and deliver credible yet compelling research briefings during court hearings.</p>
