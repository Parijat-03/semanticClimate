![[fig2_25.png]]Figure 2.25 Carbon footprints per capita income and expenditure category for 109 countries ranked by per capita income (consumption-based emissions) Notes: Countries and income categories are dependent on data availability. Blue dots represent income quintiles (lowest, low, middle, higher, and highest) of EU countries and the United States. Orange dots are for the developing country group provided by the World Bank for 4 expenditure categories: lowest, low, middle and higher (Hubacek et al., 2017b). Red diamonds represent average per capita carbon footprints. Countries are ranked from the lowest per capita income (bottom) to the highest income (top) within each country group. Countries are grouped using the IPCC's six categories high-level classification. Footprint values for higher income groups in the World Bank data are less reliable.
