They see human and environmental health as two sides of one coin. This has culminated in the emergence of the concept of &#8220;planetary health&#8221;, which is defined as &#8220;the health of human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it depends&#8221; (Whitmee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>; see also Myers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>).</p>
