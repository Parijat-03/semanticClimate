Energy-efficient buildings and appliances offer great opportunities to reduce energy intensity by 40% of residential and up to 50% of commercial buildings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> Furthermore, energy efficient products support economic development, energy security, achieve climate targets and promote the economic empowerment of women and youth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref> Among the bariers to introduce relevant policies, there is a lack of awareness among the policymakers and the public alongside the data about the possible savings. There is limited capacity, when it comes to the policy design, but most importantly market monitoring and technical implementation. In a short run, inefficient products are cheaper for the consumer, hence affordability remains a key barrier in the developing communities. The answers are already there: digitalization technology can close the digital and data divide, while international institutions should provide institutional, policy and technical capacities. Looking at energy-as-service and other innovative financing solutions can reduce the cost of entry of energy efficient products.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref></p>
