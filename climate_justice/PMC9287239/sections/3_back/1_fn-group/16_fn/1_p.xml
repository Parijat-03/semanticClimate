Bj&#248;rn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] showed that all SBT methods involve some level of emission imbalance, due to mathematical approximations in target equations, and that the sign (i.e., whether there is an emission overshoot or &#8220;undershoot&#8221;) and size of the imbalance differ across methods.</p>
