A global-scale projection suggests that decline in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce 12 basin runoff by 10% or more in at least one month of the melt season in several large river basins originated 13 in High Mountain Asia during dry seasons (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b). 14 15 There is a growing amount of climate research involving climate models in the Middle East Asia region 16 compared with AR5 stimulated by the CORDEX results in particular (Top et al., submitted). 17 18 CMIP5 models generally have difficulties in reproducing the present mean temperature and precipitation 19 climatology for the subregions represented in this area, which is partly related to the poor spatial resolution 20 of the models preventing the resolution of the complex mountainous terrain dominating Middle East Asia. 21 However, the scarceness of observational data and issues related to comparison of observations with coarse-22 resolution models add to the uncertainty regarding model quality (Christensen et al., 2013). The IPCC AR5 23 stated that temperature is generally better simulated than precipitation in terms of the amplitude and phase of 24 the seasonal cycle in accordance with a comparison of CMIP3 and CMIP5 seasonal cycles for different 25 regions. Even though the multi-model mean is close to observations, the inter-model spread remains large, 26 particularly in high-latitude regions in winter and in regions with steep orography such as Central Asia. The 27 largest systematic biases occur in annual total precipitation over land regions occur in regions which are 28 characterized by high orography and/or a large fraction of solid precipitation such as Tibetan Plateau, both of 29 which are expected to introduce a negative bias in gauge-based precipitation (Flato et al., 2013b). The IPCC 30 AR5 stated that CMIP5 models tend to be able to simulate West Asia&#8217;s basic climate state as well as the 31 main phenomena affecting it with some fidelity, but the region is at the fringes of the influence of different 32 drivers of European, Asian and African climates and remains poorly analysed in the peer-reviewed literature 33 with respect to climate model performances (Christensen et al., 2013). 34 35 According to the IPCC AR5, it is </span><span style="x0: 205.86; x1: 210.73; y0: 330.05; y1: 341.03; width: 4.87; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="205.86" y0="330.05" x1="253.96">very likely </span><span x0="253.98" y0="330.05" x1="41.44" style="x0: 253.98; x1: 257.03; y0: 330.05; y1: 341.03; width: 3.05; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">that temperatures will continue to increase over West Asia due 36 to models&#8217; </span><span style="x0: 106.2; x1: 111.69; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="106.2" y0="317.45" x1="174.86">high agreement</span><span x0="174.9" y0="317.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 174.9; x1: 177.64; y0: 317.45; y1: 328.43; width: 2.74; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.

Less annual variation is found in temperature rise over Central Asia and the 42 Tibetan Plateau. Model agreement is lower on changes for both winter and summer precipitation for the 43 whole region.
