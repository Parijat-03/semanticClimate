<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Turner (2020)</xref> highlights the detrimental effects of neoliberal urbanism and related state policies on the livelihoods of those transport users and actors who do not conform to the established direction of urban development. She examines how the state plan to transform Hanoi into a &#8216;sustainable mega-city&#8217; with seamless modern mobilities (new highways, BRTs, elevated metros, etc.) impacts on the livelihoods and mobility options of millions of motorbike drivers and users. Her paper also reveals how the disruption of those &#8216;traditional&#8217; mobilities corresponds to the loss of key forms of urban living based on solidarity, trust and compassion that are key to neighbourhood security and well-being.</p>
