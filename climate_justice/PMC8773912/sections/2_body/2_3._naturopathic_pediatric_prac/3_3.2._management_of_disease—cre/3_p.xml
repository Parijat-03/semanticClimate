The feasibility of all recommendations are ideally thoroughly explored to minimize conflict within the family environment and maximize success. It is unrealistic, for example, to significantly modify the diet of a child without considering other members of the family. Lifestyle recommendations specific to a particular child may in fact positively benefit the health of the entire family. The child should be included in planning as much as is developmentally possible to establish trust and rapport. Ideally, the child will be empowered by the plan, and take an appropriate level of responsibility in executing it. This requires some level of creativity and negotiation of choices. Practitioners attempt to engage strategies to educate, inspire, and motivate the family, making recommendations that are relevant to the unique determinants of that child&#8217;s health.</p>
