<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Middle-income Muslim women noted, sometimes bitterly, that &#8220;many men are not open to accept training for women, particularly regarding field crops&#8221; since &#8220;illiterate husbands think what will be the benefit if my wife attends agricultural trainings since she is not allowed to work in the field&#8221; (interviews with participants). They agreed that, due to norms favouring seclusion, &#8220;there is little scope to try out the new practices, but we want more opportunities which will help improve overall economic returns to the family&#8221;. They are further constrained by the fact that most agricultural extension officers are usually inaccessible to them, as women, because of the norms prohibiting interactions with non-family men: &#8220;Most agricultural extension agents are men and this is a barrier for women to attend modern training. Our husbands and families don&#8217;t let us&#8221; (interview with a participant). These findings incidentally suggest that men rarely share information from technical training with their wives, though more research is needed to verify this.</p>
