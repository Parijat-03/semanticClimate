<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The extent to which the 2019 IPCC <italic toggle="yes">Climate Change and Land</italic> report addresses the <italic toggle="yes">political dimension</italic> of land and its link to climate change is encouraging albeit limited. The concentrated discussion on &#8216;land tenure&#8217; is to be found in one section of Chapter 7, or six pages of this nearly 900-page report, with the bulk of the discussion in a tabulated format (Table 7.7). We present its highlights, not randomly, but selecting what we feel to be relevant to our discussion.</p>
