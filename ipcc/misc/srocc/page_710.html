Fiscal policies, such as taxation, subsidies, or tariffs, can be used to regulate production and consumption of certain foods and can affect environmental outcomes. In Denmark, a&#160;tax on saturated fat content of food adopted to encourage healthy eating habits accounted for 0.14% of total tax revenues between 2011 and 2012 (Sassi et al. 2018). A global tax on GHG emissions, for example, has large mitigation potential and will generate tax revenues, but may also result in large reductions in agricultural production (Henderson 2018). Consumer-level taxes on GHG-intensive food may be applied to address competitiveness issues between different countries, if some countries use taxes while others do not. However, increases in prices might impose disproportionate &#64257;nancial burdens on low-income households, and may not be publicly acceptable. A study examining the relationship between food prices and social unrest found that, between 1990 and 2011, whereas food price stability has not been associated with increases in social unrest (Bellemare 2015).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.62" top="507.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 507.55; y1: 517.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="507.55" x1="307.62">Interventions that allow people to maximise their productive potential while protecting the ES may not ensure food security in all contexts. Some household land holdings are so small that self-suf&#64257;ciency is not possible (Venton 2018). Value chain development has, in the past, increased farm income but delivered fewer bene&#64257;ts to vulnerable consumers (Bodn&#225;r et al. 2011). Ultimately, a mix of production activities and consumption support is needed. Consumption support can be used to help achieve the second important element of food security &#8211; access to food.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.61" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="387.56" x1="307.61">Agricultural technology transfer can help optimise food and nutrition security (Section&#160;7.4.4.3).

Data required include global historical datasets, many of which are unreliable, inaccessible, or not available (Maynard 2015; Lunt et al. 2016).

These policies acknowledge that households face risks across the lifecycle that they need to be protected from. If shocks are persistent, or occur numerous times, then policies can address concerns of a more structural nature (Glauben et al. 2012). Barrett (2005), for example, distinguishes between the role of safety nets (which include programmes such as emergency feeding programmes, crop or unemployment insurance, disaster assistance, etc.) and cargo nets (which include land reforms, targeted micro&#64257;nance, targeted school food programmes, etc.). While the former prevents non-poor and transient poor from becoming chronically poor, the latter is meant to lift people out of poverty by changing societal or institutional structures. The graduation approach has adopted such systematic thinking with successful results (Banerjee et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="159.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 159.57; y1: 169.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="159.57" x1="566.1">Social protection systems can provide buffers against shocks through vertical or horizontal expansion, &#8216;piggybacking&#8217; on pre-established programmes, aligning social protection and humanitarian systems or refocusing existing resources (Wilkinson et al. 2018; O&#8217;Brien et al. 2018; Jones and Presler-Marshall 2015). There is increasing evidence that forecast-based &#64257;nancing, linked to a social protection, can be used to enable anticipatory actions based on forecast triggers, and guarantee funding ahead of a shock (Jjemba et al. 2018).
