Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the &#x0201c;COVID-19 Disorder Tracker&#x0201d; initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS-1814090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D&#x02019;Orsogna</surname><given-names>Maria R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006754</institution-id><institution>Army Research Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-18-1-0345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D&#x02019;Orsogna</surname><given-names>Maria R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MRD acknowledges support from the Army Research Office (W911NF-18-1-0345) (url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arl.army.mil/">https://www.arl.army.mil/</ext-link>), and the National Science Foundation (DMS-1814090).

No country has been spared from the far-reaching impacts of the ensuing viral disease, termed COVID-19, which touched and transformed most, if not all, aspects of societal living. In the absence of a widely available vaccine, and in light of the many unknowns posed by the pandemic, governments responded with a wide array of measures aimed at avoiding large scale public health crises with varying degrees of resources, capacity, and resolve. These included restrictions on travel and mobility, social distancing and quarantine requirements, imposing school and business closures, implementing large scale testing, prohibiting large crowd gatherings. Periods of more or less stringent orders alternated depending on the local ebbs and flows of the pandemic. In parallel, governments also increased spending to reduce the risk of permanent damage to their economies and to alleviate unemployment and poverty. Policymakers have been confronted with philosophical and moral questions centered on how to balance individual freedoms and preserving the economy while protecting the lives of vulnerable populations, and on whether utilitarian-outcome or kantian-deontological approaches should be taken [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, especially at the onset of the pandemic, different jurisdictions adopted different strategies due to the limited scientific understanding of COVID-19, and without being able to fully anticipate the medium-term health, social and political implications of their decisions. Sweden for example chose not to enter a lockdown while the rest of Europe did; in the US emergency orders were implemented after non-uniform threshold levels were met across the country, resulting in significant variability from county to county [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, the recent announcement of the development of effective vaccines is marked by questions not only on how to optimally scale up production but also how to distribute vaccines in an ethical manner [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>While not perfect and difficult to evaluate, the above interventions for the most part helped prevent more widespread transmission and buffer worse economic fallouts [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By the same token, they have provoked concerns over becoming drivers of economic uncertainty and deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], reinforcing economic inequality [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], engendering political distrust [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and leading to long-term mental health consequences as a result of prolonged physical isolation and reduced human interaction [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ultimately COVID-19 has caused what are poised to be long-lasting economic, financial, and social crises worldwide.</p><p>Traditional and social media have played a significant role in disseminating COVID-19 related information [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They have helped turn best practices into habits, and offered personalized networking opportunities in times of solitude. However, politicization of the pandemic, the sharing of non-vetted yet sensational or controversial findings or hypothesis, and algorithmic manipulation by platform hosts, have allowed for conspiracy theories and misinformation to spread, causing anxiety and discontent [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>All these ingredients&#x02014;the emergence of a pandemic most were not prepared for, the difficulty for policymakers in make clear-sighted decisions that could be well received by a diverse set of stakeholders, the online spread of distorted information, personal fears and the need to connect to others&#x02014;have arguably combined to spark pandemic-related social unrest throughout the globe as manifest by the numerous protests, riots and disorders recorded in many countries. Although these events have attracted media attention and ignited public debate, their characteristics and timing are poorly understood. Protests ignited by past outbreaks offer little insight into current societal unrest due to their comparatively limited spatio-temporal scope, and the lack of accurate data collection at the time they occurred.</p><p>In this paper we investigate the temporal distribution of civil disorders directly attributable to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and, specifically, the temporal clustering and self-excitability of events. These &#x0201c;contagion&#x0201d; trends are recurrent in human activity and have been observed in criminal behavior [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], terrorist attacks [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], political shocks [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], violent conflicts [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and collective protesting and rioting [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We hypothesize they also characterize the current COVID-19 protests worldwide.</p><p>Our analyses focus on the three countries that were most hit by protests, riots, and violent events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, namely India, Israel, and Mexico, as per data made available through the &#x0201c;COVID-19 Disorder Tracker&#x0201d; (CDT) initiative [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] curated by the &#x0201c;Armed Conflict Location &#x00026; Event Data Project&#x0201d; (ACLED) [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While we recognize that peaceful protests are distinct from riots or episodes of violence against civilians, and that they carry different features and theoretical implications [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we do not discriminate among them in our analyses due to their shared, high-level etiological trigger: the COVID-19 pandemic. Note that concurrent with the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis are other episodes of civil unrest whose primary source is not pandemic-related, most notably the Lives Matter protests that originated in Minneapolis in late May 2020 in the wake of George Floyd&#x02019;s murder and that persist at this time of writing. ACLED does not tally these events, and we do not include them in our work as these demonstrations arise primarily in response to racial injustice, although racial disparities in COVID-19 cases may have contributed to the unrest.</p><p>For each of the three countries we focus on, we study the temporal clustering and self-excitability of pandemic-related demonstrations on the national and subnational scales. We assume all events recorded by ACLED in a given country are part of the same underlying stream of events, whereas on the local level we construct mutually exclusive geographical clusters through <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. Temporal self-excitation is studied by applying the Hawkes process [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a stochastic point process initially used to understand aftershocks in the vicinity of an earthquake epicenter, and later adapted to finance, cell signaling, and disease-spread. In relation to social phenomena, Hawkes process have also been applied to describe and analyze the distribution of violent events, such as terrorist attacks [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], gun violence [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and gang-related crimes [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hawkes processes are non-Markovian extensions of Poisson processes. The latter are memory-less with events following a random temporal distribution, whereas the likelihood of an event in a Hawkes process depends on past ones, leading to clustering, memory effects, and self-excitability. These features are well-suited to study human behaviors that appear to be patterned in time. We fit both Poisson and Hawkes processes to data within each cluster to verify if and how temporal clustering emerges at various subnational scales.</p><p>Our analysis reveals that temporal clustering of pandemic-related demonstrations is a common feature in all three countries. Despite variations in the temporal distribution of events and in the magnitude of self-excitability and reactivity across the three different contexts, Hawkes processes better capture the underlying dynamics present in the data compared to Poisson processes. Furthermore, we find that self-excitability at the national level appears to emerge as the convergence of subnational, cluster-based self-excitatory events, rather than as the result of a meso-level stream of events. Our results highlight the interplay between the national and subnational socio-political discourse in the emergence of large-scale disorders that may erupt in response to centralized decisions, with information easily channeled through social media and other communication networks, but may also manifest locally, with the global source of discontent becoming particularized to local grievances and sources of tension.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the Background section we briefly review the protesting and rioting literature in other contexts. We also provide a synthetic account of the evolution of the pandemic in each of the three countries under investigation. In the Materials and Methods section will describe the ACLED data we utilize and outline our methodology. The statistical outcomes of our inferential models, along with additional analyses on the temporal characteristics of events in each country and cluster, are presented in the Results section. Finally, in the Discussion and Conclusion section we discuss the relevance of our results and their broader significance.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2 Background</title><p>COVID-19-related social unrest has been observed in several countries in the form of protests, riots, and other demonstrations, often in response to virus-containment decisions imposed by governments. These decisions may have seemed too onerous, unfair, or the root cause of economic uncertainty. It is important to understand the characteristics of this unrest for two reasons: one is preventative, as demonstrations always carry the risk of widespread contagion, given their often chaotic and crowded nature, and of devolving into uncontrolled, violent clashes with authorities and/or among protesters and counter-protesters. The other is more introspective, as these protests may be manifestations of latent societal discontent, predating the pandemic, invigorated by newly mandated restrictive policies.</p><p>Though unique in its global reach, the current pandemic does not represent a <italic>unicum</italic> in terms of the social unrest it has caused. History has repeatedly been marked by uprising and protests in response to social, political, and economic crises. In recent decades, social movements and collective action have mobilized citizens in demanding changes to political regimes, economic policies, and more respect for human rights. A vast academic literature has emerged as a result, to study why, how, when large scale peaceful and violent demonstrations occur and what their repercussions may be [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Sociological and social movement studies [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have been central in describing various theoretical frameworks underlying social unrest. Political science studies have helped dissect the political conditions in which riots and protests flourish and anticipate possible micro&#x02013; and macro&#x02013;consequences such as conflicts, regime changes, and revolutions [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Criminological studies have concentrated on understanding how deviant behavior can emerge in non-peaceful assemblies and in outlining related policing strategies [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Psychological studies have helped unveil the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms occurring in individuals when engaged in collective action [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The last decades have also witnessed the increased use of quantitative methodologies to study disorder events of various nature that have been used across disciplines and that have helped uncover consistent patterns. At the end of the 1970s, T.J. Sullivan [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and M.I. Midlarsky [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while belonging to distinct academic fields (social psychology and political science, respectively), highlighted &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; features in the size distribution and dynamical evolution of crowds. M.I. Midlarsky, in particular, emerged as a strong advocate for the incorporation of quantitative frameworks within the study of collective social phenomena. In one of his seminal works, he demonstrated the presence of two underlying processes driving the urban disorders of 1966-67 in several US cities, diffusion and contagion, at a time when neither had been proven. The same empirical techniques were later applied to the study of transnational terrorism [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The greater availability of data in recent years has vastly improved our understanding of societal unrest and has led to refined statistical and computational approaches. Sources include law enforcement and institutional organizations, social media platforms and news agencies [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Among the most investigated scenarios are the 2005 Paris riots [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the 2011 London riots [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], political protests in Latin America [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the Arab Spring [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In all cases non-random behaviors were detected such as clustering processes, cascading dynamics, and self-excitability.

Migrant workers unable to return home due to lockdown orders staged protests at railway stations, health workers went on strike over the lack of protective equipment and adequate pay, agricultural workers demanded payment of lockdown wages and protested the lack of aid despite government promises, students demonstrated against holding University admission exams and requested they be deferred due to infection risks and the difficulty of reaching exam centers. General strikes were organized to rally against poverty and unemployment triggered by COVID-19. On some occasions, episodes of state repression and violent enforcement of lockdown orders occurred as an attempt to quell these disorders. Long standing conflicts tied to identity politics, immigration, secessionist movements and boundary disputes have also been impacted by COVID-19.

Authorities soon issued a 14-day isolation policy for citizens who had visited South Korea or Japan; social distancing and related measures were imposed on March 11<sup>th</sup>, a ban on public gatherings of more than 10 people followed on March 15<sup>th</sup>. Finally, on March 19<sup>th</sup>, a state of emergency was declared and a national lockdown imposed. A contact-tracing program was approved on March 16<sup>th</sup>, allowing the Israeli Security Agency to track the mobility of individuals through mobile phone data. The program quickly sparked controversy and nationwide protests over the invasion of privacy and the overreaching surveillance of citizens. It was halted at the end of April. Additional restrictions were imposed between the end of March, in anticipation of the Passover Seder festivity on April 8<sup>th</sup> including a travel ban and the creation of a restricted zone in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox town east of Tel Aviv with one of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country. Restrictions were eased between the end of April and the beginning of May.

In July, in response to steadily increasing &#x0201c;second wave&#x0201d; infections, the Knesset reauthorized the contact-tracing program, once more igniting civil liberties organizations; new social distancing rules were also imposed.

ACLED is a well-known open-source data collection organization cataloguing global crises and conflicts, created to facilitate the study of political violence and social unrest. Its recent CDT initiative records events that are directly related to COVID-19 and excludes disorders that may temporally overlap with the pandemic but that are not directly related to it, such as conflicts between armed militias over a disputed territory (see [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). The dataset includes, for example, protests against governments in response to COVID-19 decisions, attacks against COVID-19 healthcare workers, or against individuals who may allegedly spread the virus to others. Events are labeled as one of six types: violence against civilians, riots, protests, explosions, battles, and strategic developments. We exclude the strategic development category as it lists contextually relevant episodes that are not political violence but that may trigger, lessen or explain them. These are typically tactical changes by one of the relevant actors, such a government announcing a state of emergency or the easing of lockdown restrictions. In addition to type, the dataset records date and location of the event, the subjects involved, reported fatalities. Data is collected from governmental institutions, news media, humanitarian agencies, and research publications. The database is updated every week; in this work we included events occurring between January 3<sup>rd</sup> to December 12<sup>th</sup> 2020. Within this interval, a total of 20,135 disorder events were recorded worldwide. When considering weekly averages we will consider Sunday as the first day of the week and Saturday as the last. Hence, weekly averages will be conducted over the period January 5<sup>th</sup> to December 12<sup>th</sup> 2020, yielding weeks 2 to 50 of the year 2020. Week 1 of 2020 is the period between December 29<sup>th</sup> 2019 and January 4<sup>th</sup> 2020. Since disorder events were first recorded on January 3<sup>rd</sup> 2020 we assume all prior dates in week 1 carry zero events.</p><p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0250433.g003">Fig 3</xref> displays the time-series of all types of events for the countries we investigate. As can be seen, trends differ due to the different political timelines. In India, the first pandemic-related event was recorded in January 2020, but was followed by only five others over the first two months of the year. Most disorders in India occurred in April (431 events, 14.8% of the countrywide total), May (592 events, 20.3% of the countrywide total), and June (481 events, 16.5% of the countrywide total). On June 29<sup>th</sup> 123 protests were tallied nationwide, the largest number during the period of interest and corresponding to 4.2% of the total number of events in India. These protests were promoted by Congress in opposition to increasing fuel prices despite economic hardships due to the coronavirus crisis. In Israel disorders first emerged in March 2020, however the greatest number of demonstrations occurred in October (1,427 events, 40.4% of the countrywide total) and in November (1,037 events 29.4% of the countrywide total). The dramatic spikes observed in this period overlap with the lockdown orders announced at the onset of the second wave of infections; the Flag Movement promoted nationwide demonstrations. In Mexico, disorders also first appeared in March 2020. However, the distribution of events here seems to be more uniform than in India and Israel; this may be due to Mexico never having imposed a complete, countrywide lockdown. The highest recorded number of disorders in the country were tallied on March 30<sup>th</sup> (36 events) when health workers protested against the lack of medical supplies and equipment, and on April 27<sup>th</sup> (28 events) and May 25<sup>th</sup> (32 events) when citizens demanded better economic and financial aid.

As can be seen from <xref rid="pone.0250433.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> values of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> are larger in C1 and C2 (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 1.52 and 1.40 events per day, respectively) than in C3 and C4 (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.57 and 0.71 events per day, respectively) however the associated timescales 1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> are less than one day in C1 and C2 (1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.5 and 0.6 days, respectively), smaller compared to those observed for C3 and C4 (1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 1.54 and 1.2 days, respectively). These results suggest that C1 and C2 are marked by more intense, yet more quickly damped feedback activity than C3 and C4. The two opposite trends lead to relatively uniform branching ratios across clusters with <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> ranging from <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.88 (C2) to <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.79 (C1). Of particular interest is C3, the most sparse cluster, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0250433.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This cluster also carries the least number of events (436) and displays the lowest reactivity yet, it displays the longest timescale, leading to a very large branching ratio <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.88. These results suggest that although disorder events are rarer in C3, feedback effects are very strong and echoes of disorder persist the longest. Finally, the background intensity <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> is highest in C1 (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic> = 0.61 events per day) and smallest in C3 (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic> = 0.17 events per day). Overall, one may expect the emergence of roughly 9 events per day countrywide, with a high likelihood of events being self-excited; disaggregating trends within the separate clusters shows that most of these events are to be expected in C2 and C1, and to a lesser degree in C4 and C3. While C3 contributes less than others to the expected daily disorder count, the degree of self-excitation is strong. Interestingly, C1 and C2 are also the clusters that according to the 2011 Census of India, host the states with the most dense population: Uttar Pradesh in C1 (200 million residents, and a density of 828 persons per km<sup>2</sup>) and Bihar in C3 (105 million residents, and a density of 1,102 persons per km<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>4.2 Israel</title><p>We apply similar procedures for disorder events in Israel, leading to the four clusters displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0250433.g007">Fig 7</xref>.

The fact that this feature emerges with so much clarity in Israel compared to India may be a consequence of its much smaller territorial extent, a more linguistically homogenous population, and/or larger access to broadband internet, but also the result of the Flag Movement&#x02019;s nation-wide campaigns.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0250433.g011">Fig 11</xref> displays cluster trends at the weekly level. Contrary to what observed for India and Israel, disorder events have mostly persisted throughout the COVID-19 crisis: in Mexico there have been no major interruptions of protests, riots or violence against civilians since the onset of the pandemic. This may be due to the government never having imposed a complete lockdown in the country. However, the alignment in peaks of disorder activity across clusters is weak, and much less pronounced than in India or Israel. For instance, while C4 (the cluster that records the majority of events) shows sustained activity on weeks <italic>j</italic> = 14 (March 29<sup>th</sup> to April 4<sup>th</sup>), <italic>j</italic> = 16 (April 12<sup>th</sup> to April 18<sup>th</sup>), and <italic>j</italic> = 18 (April 26<sup>th</sup> to May 2<sup>nd</sup>), similar trends are not detected in the other clusters.

As for India and Israel, the Hawkes process yields better outcomes than the baseline Poisson process in modeling disorder events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, both nationwide and at the cluster level. Furthermore, all models fitted with data on Mexico passed the KS test as well, testifying to the goodness of fit provided by the specific Hawkes formalization of a self-excitability process. We identify an underlying temporal-dependence among events even in the case of C3, the cluster with least number of events. Countrywide, the 1, 276 events yield a Hawkes process marked by reactivity <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 2.29 events per day, with a relatively short lifetime of 1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.41 days. The branching ratio is <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.79, indicating a considerable amount of self-excitability, although much less than what observed in India and Israel. Among the various clusters, the greatest reactivity is observed in C4 with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 1.66, decreasing in other clusters until a minimum of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.10 events per day is reached in C3; C1 is also the cluster where the longest lifetime of self-excitatory phenomena is observed, with 1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 6.88 days whereas the shortest is in C4 where 1/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.44 days. Overall, the cluster values of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> yield sensibly lower values of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> compared to India and Israel, ranging from <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.54 (C2) to <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.73 (C4) and confirming the nationwide trend.

Specifically, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distributions and characteristics of demonstrations in the three countries with the highest number of events <italic>i.e</italic>., India, Israel, and Mexico between January 3<sup>rd</sup> and December 12<sup>th</sup> 2020. Using the well known Hawkes point process we investigated whether self-exciting effects could arise across events. We first considered countrywide data and later identified distinct geographical clusters in each of the three countries, to investigate trends on the more local level. Our intent was to better understand the macro- and meso-scale mechanisms that govern disorder events occurring in the same general context (the pandemic) but that may be ignited, shaped, acerbated or placated by more local happenings. Our work is in line with other empirical studies related to social tension, nucleated by the seminal work of M. I. Midlarsky [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and that include analyses of the 2011 London riots [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0250433.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and of the 2005 Paris riots [<xref rid="pone.0250433.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>We identified four geographical clusters in each of the the countries we investigated by employing <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, These hosted varying numbers of events, were of varying spatial extent, and mostly followed clear geographical separations. We observed self-excitatory effects in all countries and in almost all subnational clusters, and found that the time-dependent Hawkes process is always a better fit to the disorder data than a simple Poisson process. We also performed several robustness checks, such as modifying the random number generator, or considering shorter time windows (see S1.6 section in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0250433.s001">S1 File</xref>); the number of clusters, and the applicability of the Hawkes process persisted in all cases. These results show that temporal dependence and self-excitability at the national level are not the result of the superimposition of unstructured, random processes at the subnational level. Instead, disorder events naturally cluster already at the local level, regardless of cluster size, and country examined.</p><p>However, while the temporal dependency between events, a hallmark of the Hawkes process, represents a common feature of protests, riots, and similar events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, important differences in the magnitude of these dependencies arise both intra- and inter-country. The three parameters that define the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes processes, <italic>i.e</italic>. the background rate <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>, the reactivity <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, the decay rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, as well as other derived quantities such as the branching ratio <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and the average expected intensity E[&#x003bb;(<italic>t</italic>)], report a wide heterogeneity. This may be due to local infectivity trends, local decision-making, and how the pandemic and the associated measures impacted local calendars of religious or public holidays.</p><p>The distribution of disorder events in Mexico for instance, does not display large variations between March and October 2020; in India, although the frequency of disorders has always remained relatively large starting in April 2020, major spikes emerged in May 2020 and between June and July 2020. Israel, finally, displays an even more extreme situation: a handful of events were recorded in March 2020, but intense protesting occurred between September and October 2020. As a result of the relatively homogenous temporal trend, Mexico is associated with the largest background intensity <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>; reactivity <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> on the other hand is largest in Israel, the country which also displays the shortest duration of an excitation <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In Israel, the influence of an event lasts for <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> = 0.04 days, ten times less than in India and Mexico where <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> = 0.46 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;1</sup> = 0.41 days, respectively, The more homogeneous course of events in Mexico is also manifest in the lowest branching factor, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.791, compared to India and Israel (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.946, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> = 0.972), implying that the probability that an event is endogenously generated as a consequence of another event is lowest in Mexico. Among the social and political events driving these patterns are the lack of a complete lockdown in Mexico, large scale protests in Israel as organized by the Flag Movement, the more compact geography and stronger internet connectivity in Israel compared to Mexico and India, which are also more linguistically and culturally heterogeneous. In all cases, the highest reactivity <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> emerges at the national scale, conversely, the average number of days upon which events may excite others is always highest in subnational clusters. Correlating the number of events with specific cluster demographic or geographical characteristics is outside the scope of this paper. However, regions with large numbers of pandemic-related events are often, but not always, characterized by large populations and/or large population densities. One notable exception is Jammu-Kashmir, a region in India marked by a relatively large number of events that is not among the country&#x02019;s most populous, nor most dense areas. Similarly, while the greater Jerusalem area is among the most densely inhabited in Israel, relatively few disorder events have been recorded here. These findings underly the need to consider the intersectionality of many demographic, socioeconomic, political and/or religious factors when trying to understand why some clusters display more events than others.</p><p>Our work comes with some limitations. First, a more systematic approach to assess temporal dependence and self-excitability on the global scale is needed, especially considering the risk of prolonged restrictive measures during national vaccination campaigns. Although India, Israel, and Mexico report the highest number of disorders, they represent a small fraction of the countries in which disorders have occurred. Evaluating whether temporal clustering is a universal characteristic would help advance our knowledge on human behavior under prolonged periods of duress, and under greater social and cultural diversity. Furthermore, we did not distinguish events based upon their nature (<italic>e.g</italic>., protests vs. violence against civilians), motives (<italic>e.g</italic>., protests against restrictions imposed by the government vs. protests against the lack of supplies for health care workers; or participant type (migrant workers vs. students). As mentioned, the vast majority of events in India, Israel and Mexico, have been peaceful protests, however the dataset we utilized did not allow for a clear stratification of motives or participant type. Disentangling the distinct mechanisms that trigger self-excitability based on the qualitative features of the event themselves and the demands participants carry, would greatly add to our understanding of how social unrest unfolds.</p><p>Notwithstanding, our work shows that analyzing disorders at the national and subnational scales is useful. A national focus allows us to understand higher-level dynamics that transcend physical distances, especially in the current era of unprecedentedly fast information (and disinformation) spread. Social-media and other forms of long-distance connectivity can facilitate the dissemination of government decisions but also help large scale planning of nationwide or even international disorders. Understanding subnational dynamics allows for a more nuanced picture as local streams of protests may be ignited by more local issues. The global nature of the pandemic does not imply that its impacts are homogeneously distributed; to the contrary, existing socio-economic contexts lead to heterogeneous responses to the unfolding and management of the crisis. Decisions taken may resonate differently in different communities, which may be more or less concerned with the restriction of individual freedoms, being able to provide for one&#x02019;s livelihood, or prevent authoritarianism, and this may lead to localized waves of disorders, with a diverse composition of participants. Finally, our work underscores the need to align citizen trust with governmental decisions, especially at the local level, so that the implementation of restrictions and other public health measures are perceived to be temporary and in the interest of the common good, and that appropriate supporting policies are promoted to ensure the least economic disruption and uncertainty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0250433.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0250433.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0250433.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;This manuscript presents an interesting application of Hawkes processes and k-means clustering to the spatial and temporal relationships between civil disorder events. In particular, the paper provides a quantitative evaluation of the suspected interplay between a government&#x02019;s efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant civil unrest. I do not have any major comments on the use of Hawkes processes for this data. I found the description of the method and communication of results very informative.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>Background</p><p>- Line 189+: When the BLM protests are discussed earlier in the paper, it&#x02019;s stated that disorder such as this would not be included in the work since they &#x0201c;arise primarily in response to racial injustice, although racial disparities in COVID-19 cases may have contributed to the unrest.&#x0201d; This seems like a sensible exclusion, and I wonder if this exclusion criteria should also apply to the June CAA demonstrations. The authors seem to make the case that these are not primarily a result of the pandemic. In fact, they seem to be quelled rather than incited following lockdown orders.</p><p>Results</p><p>- I wonder if the box plots contribute enough to the overall objective to remain included as figures or if they could be removed in order to avoid detracting from the more informative results. There is very little main text dedicated to interpreting them in the Results section and none in the Discussion. Given the expected (and demonstrated) skew of the data, it seems like a less than ideal visualization technique. If the average count of weekly events is worth reporting explicitly, then that can be accomplished in the text and without a corresponding figure. Further, the distribution of weekly counts and its variability can be more clearly observed in the time series plots, which also allows the reader to see the temporal trends that lead up to "outlier" weeks.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Background</p><p>- Generally, these paragraphs are very dense with important and overlapping dates for each country. Perhaps a timeline figure would complement these descriptions and make this information easier to parse.</p><p>- Line 159-160: awkward sentence structure</p><p>- Line 165: &#x0201c;22nd&#x0201d;</p><p>- Line 168-169: awkward sentence structure</p><p>- Line 254: &#x0201c;including those who work in the informal economy&#x0201d;</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>- Fig. 1 caption:</p><p>o PLOS One guidelines require that all non-standard abbreviations be defined. Would recommend for &#x0201c;Violence a.c.&#x0201d;</p><p>o There&#x02019;s a spelling issue in the database name (should be ACLED not ALCED)</p><p>o Consider including the date range for the data displayed to make the figure and caption stand alone.</p><p>Results</p><p>- Consider changing the x-axes on the country/cluster specific time-series plots to match the time series from Figure 2. I don&#x02019;t feel strongly about this, but for the sake of historical context, dates may be more useful than indexed weeks.</p><p>- Line 498: missing punctuation after &#x0201c;synchrony&#x0201d;</p><p>- Lines 549-551: awkward sentence structure should be reworked (maybe one sentence got broken into two?)</p><p>Discussion</p><p>- Line 620: typo &#x0201c;dcay&#x0201d;</p><p>- Line 661: missing word &#x0201c;allows us to understand&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;In this work, the authors use Poisson and Hawkes processes to model the temporal dynamics of pandemic-related disorder events in India, Israel, and Mexico, and use k-means clustering to assess spatial clustering. The manuscript is well-written and appears scientifically sound. However, the manuscript would benefit from more thorough citation, more condensed figures, and better consistency across figures. I recommend that the manuscript be accepted contingent on addressing these issues.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. The introduction would benefit from more citations for various claims about the global response to COVID-19 and the role of media, if such references are available. I don&#x02019;t doubt that these claims are accurate, but think the introduction would be strengthened by the addition of more references.</p><p>2. Have similar methods been used to study other types of disorder, violence, or other human behaviors? Please add a brief statement with references in the introduction on the applicability of these methods to this type of problem. It looks like examples are given in Section 2, but it is not clear whether the methodology is similar.</p><p>3. Are there references for the estimates of what proportion of the population had internet access in 2020?</p><p>4. Section 2.1 would also benefit from additional references for the specific examples that are given, such as: protests in response to the CAA; traffic light monitoring plans; clashes with police; increase in murders and femicides.</p><p>5. Please include a citation for the COVID-19 Disorder Tracker dataset and ACLED in Section 3 (line 270-271).</p><p>6. Figure 2 seems to be missing.</p><p>7. Line 417: &#x0201c;Cluster 2 accounts for the majority of disorder events&#x0201d; &#x02013; this is not quite accurate, and the term &#x0201c;plurality&#x0201d; should be used instead.</p><p>8. Tables 2, 3, 4: Are there tests for statistical significance that can be used to compare these values between clusters?</p><p>9. Line 463: by &#x0201c;more damped&#x0201d; feedback, do you mean shorter? This is not totally clear; perhaps the wording should be &#x0201c;more quickly damped&#x0201d;.</p><p>10. Can differences in the number of events for each cluster be explained primarily by population size? It seems natural that more events would occur in larger populations.</p><p>11. In Figure 10, it is misleading to use the scale of 0.95-1 since there is really very little difference in values, yet visually it appears there are large differences. This figure could likely even be omitted, since there is no meaningful difference between the correlations. Similarly, in Figure 6 it is misleading to use a two-color scale when all values are positive. In general, for the pairwise correlation plots, there should be a consistent color map from -1 to 1, with one color for negative values and another color for positive values, so that the color scale is the same across all plots. This would allow for comparison between plots and better interpretation.</p><p>12. There are quite a lot of figures. It may be beneficial to condense some figures into panel figures; for example, to combine all figures for one country into a single panel figure.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>13. Line 58: &#x0201c;Disorded&#x0201d; -&#x0003e; &#x0201c;Disorder&#x0201d;</p><p>14. Line 164: &#x0201c;22th&#x0201d; -&#x0003e; &#x0201c;22nd&#x0201d;</p><p>15. Line 244: &#x0201c;began reported&#x0201d; -&#x0003e; &#x0201c;began reporting&#x0201d;</p><p>16. The figure files don&#x02019;t seem to be presented in order, and there are multiple files for each figure. Please ensure figures are correctly inserted for publication.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

In particular, the paper provides a quantitative evaluation of the suspected interplay between a government&#x02019;s efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant civil unrest. I do not have any major comments on the use of Hawkes processes for this data. I found the description of the method and communication of results very informative.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>Background</p><p>- Line 189+: When the BLM protests are discussed earlier in the paper, it&#x02019;s stated that disorder such as this would not be included in the work since they &#x0201c;arise primarily in response to racial injustice, although racial disparities in COVID-19 cases may have contributed to the unrest.&#x0201d; This seems like a sensible exclusion, and I wonder if this exclusion criteria should also apply to the June CAA demonstrations. The authors seem to make the case that these are not primarily a result of the pandemic. In fact, they seem to be quelled rather than incited following lockdown orders.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point. We confirm that social unrest events concurrent with the pandemic are not tallied by the ACLED&#x02019;s COVID Disorder Tracker initiative, and therefore are not included in our analyses. What is reported in the Background section (particularly in reference to India), is simply a description of the timeline of the most relevant events that took place during 2020, at the same time of the pandemic. This does not mean that CAA disorders are part of the ACLED/CDT dataset. If they were, we would have excluded them from our analyses, given that &#x02013; as for the BLM protests &#x02013; their motive is not intrinsically related to the pandemic, as the reviewer rightly points out.</p><p>ACLED&#x02019;s methodology in filtering out non-pandemic related protests is very clearly detailed in the brief published (and cited in our manuscript) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/04/ACLED_Direct-COVID19-Disorder_Methodology-Brief_4.2020.pdfcontent/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/04/ACLED_Direct-COVID19-Disorder_Methodology-Brief_4.2020.pdf">https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/04/ACLED_Direct-COVID19-Disorder_Methodology-Brief_4.2020.pdfcontent/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/04/ACLED_Direct-COVID19-Disorder_Methodology-Brief_4.2020.pdf</ext-link></p><p>where they state:</p><p>For users interested in data capturing disorder linked to the coronavirus, ACLED offers a curated data file containing all events that are directly related to the pandemic. By &#x02018;directly related&#x02019;, we mean all events for which the word &#x02018;coronavirus&#x02019; is included in the &#x02018;Notes&#x02019; column of the ACLED dataset to specifically indicate that the pandemic was an explicit factor. ACLED Researchers include this tag only when an incident report makes obvious that the coronavirus motivated the event (e.g. &#x0201c;A protest occurred in opposition to movement restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus&#x0201d;). Events that are directly related to the pandemic include things such as:</p><p>&#x025cf; The targeting of healthcare workers responding to the coronavirus</p><p>&#x025cf; Violent mobs attacking individuals due to fears of their alleged links to the coronavirus (e.g. Muslims in India; foreigners in Africa; etc.)</p><p>&#x025cf; Demonstrations against governance decisions made in response to the coronavirus</p><p>No reference to the coronavirus will be made for events that are not directly related to the pandemic (e.g. &#x0201c;A battle occurred and was not connected to the coronavirus&#x0201d;). In this way, ACLED can ensure that the &#x02018;coronavirus&#x02019; tag does not trigger such an event&#x02019;s inclusion in the curated data file as a false positive</p><p>Results</p><p>- I wonder if the box plots contribute enough to the overall objective to remain included as figures or if they could be removed in order to avoid detracting from the more informative results. There is very little main text dedicated to interpreting them in the Results section and none in the Discussion. Given the expected (and demonstrated) skew of the data, it seems like a less than ideal visualization technique. If the average count of weekly events is worth reporting explicitly, then that can be accomplished in the text and without a corresponding figure. Further, the distribution of weekly counts and its variability can be more clearly observed in the time series plots, which also allows the reader to see the temporal trends that lead up to "outlier" weeks.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers&#x02019; comment regarding the marginal usefulness of the box plot, especially compared to the time-series plots. In light of this, we have now moved the box plots to the Supporting Information.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Background</p><p>- Generally, these paragraphs are very dense with important and overlapping dates for each country. Perhaps a timeline figure would complement these descriptions and make this information easier to parse.</p><p>We have now provided a figure at the end of the Background section illustrating a timeline with the most relevant events in the COVID-19 pandemic for each country.</p><p>- Line 159-160: awkward sentence structure ?</p><p>Fixed.</p><p>- Line 165: &#x0201c;22nd&#x0201d;</p><p>Fixed.</p><p>- Line 168-169: awkward sentence structure</p><p>Corrected.</p><p>- Line 254: &#x0201c;including those who work in the informal economy&#x0201d;</p><p>Fixed.</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>- Fig. 1 caption:</p><p>o PLOS One guidelines require that all non-standard abbreviations be defined.

I don&#x02019;t feel strongly about this, but for the sake of historical context, dates may be more useful than indexed weeks.</p><p>We have carefully considered this option, but have concluded that for clarity it is best to keep the axes as they are. In Figure 2 we focus on time-series at the daily level and plot the data jointly for all three countries of interest. In this case, using actual dates facilitates the processing and interpretation of the graphic. However, in the country/cluster specific time-series we display weekly-level time series for each country without juxtaposing data for all three so it makes more sense to keep indexed weeks which are easier to display and which reduce the risk of confusion. Note that we do provide information on start and end dates, to allow for the extrapolation of actual dates from the indexed ones. Furthermore, when discussing the findings from these plots in the main text, we included the corresponding actual dates. This should help the reader better place events within the timeline of the pandemic.</p><p>- Line 498: missing punctuation after &#x0201c;synchrony&#x0201d;</p><p>Fixed.</p><p>- Lines 549-551: awkward sentence structure should be reworked (maybe one sentence got broken into two?)</p><p>Fixed.

The manuscript is well-written and appears scientifically sound. However, the manuscript would benefit from more thorough citation, more condensed figures, and better consistency across figures. I recommend that the manuscript be accepted contingent on addressing these issues.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. The introduction would benefit from more citations for various claims about the global response to COVID-19 and the role of media, if such references are available. I don&#x02019;t doubt that these claims are accurate, but think the introduction would be strengthened by the addition of more references.</p><p>We have now provided citations in the Introduction addressing the role of the media, as well as other ones we believe deserved better referencing.

Line 417: &#x0201c;Cluster 2 accounts for the majority of disorder events&#x0201d; &#x02013; this is not quite accurate, and the term &#x0201c;plurality&#x0201d; should be used instead.</p><p>We have corrected as suggested.</p><p>8. Tables 2, 3, 4: Are there tests for statistical significance that can be used to compare these values between clusters?</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, not quite. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is typically used as a goodness of fit test for Hawkes processes, and implies that the set of compensators calculated at each event time should define a Poisson processes. It may be that two clusters differ in the outcomes of the KS test (e.g., one of them passes the KS test the other does not), and therefore we can &#x0201c;compare&#x0201d; the clusters claiming that in one case there is support for the use of a Hawkes process with an exponential decay function, while in the other the modeling choice does not fit well. However, it would make little sense to compare the magnitude and significance of the tests between clusters, especially given that the sampled residuals vary in numbers across clusters.</p><p>9. Line 463: by &#x0201c;more damped&#x0201d; feedback, do you mean shorter? This is not totally clear; perhaps the wording should be &#x0201c;more quickly damped&#x0201d;</p><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have clarified by using &#x0201c;more quickly damped&#x0201d;, as suggested.</p><p>10. Can differences in the number of events for each cluster be explained primarily by population size? It seems natural that more events would occur in larger populations.</p><p>We appreciate very much the reviewer's suggestion to correlate the number of protes events in each cluster with its population. In the paper, we identified the clusters with the largest number of events, however, due to the many possible variables at play, thoroughly correlating the number of events with cluster-specific characteristics (not just density, but also overall population, percent of rural population, percent of young persons, income, climate, political leanings, government responsiveness) would require an analysis of its own, and is outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>Nonetheless, during this review process, we did take a closer look of the data, and noted that in India the greatest number of events does often occur in clusters that contain populous or densely populated states or Union Territories (e.g., Punjab and Assam in Clusters 1 and 2, respectively). However, the Union Territory with the highest number of protest events - Jammu and Kashmir - is neither among the most populous or the densest, implying that other socio-political or socio-economic factors might be at play in igniting the covid-related protests.</p><p>The data from Mexico shows that the greatest number of events occurs in Cluster C4 that contains the most populous, dense states of the country including the capital, Mexico City (population 9 million, density 6,180 persons/km2), and the state of Mexico proper.</p><p>Finally, in Israel, the greatest number of events occurs in Cluster C4 that contains the city of Haifa, among the most densely populated in Israel. Cluster 3, which is the second highest in terms of recorded events, contains other populated territories of the country, including Tel Aviv and the Sharon plain. Interestingly, Jerusalem, also one of the highest density areas in the country, is not characterized by a significantly high number of disorder events.</p><p>As mentioned above, these not-so-clear cut observations show that correlating the number of events with specific cluster demographic or geographical characteristics may be too simplistic. For completeness, we added a paragraph in the conclusion with a brief discussion, underlying the need to consider the intersectionality of socioeconomic, political and/or religious factors when trying to understand why some clusters display more events than others.</p><p>11. In Figure 10, it is misleading to use the scale of 0.95-1 since there is really very little difference in values, yet visually it appears there are large differences. This figure could likely even be omitted, since there is no meaningful difference between the correlations. Similarly, in Figure 6 it is misleading to use a two-color scale when all values are positive. In general, for the pairwise correlation plots, there should be a consistent color map from -1 to 1, with one color for negative values and another color for positive values, so that the color scale is the same across all plots. This would allow for comparison between plots and better interpretation.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which allowed us to rethink the way we present our correlation plots in the manuscript at the subnational scale and to find ways to better display our findings. We believe that the correlation plots are important as they convey relevant information regarding the event distributions within each cluster. Hence, we think it is more informative to keep them in the main body of the manuscript.</p><p>To strike a balance between plot comparability (i.e., one should be able to compare each plot in each country with the corresponding plot in another country) and consistency (i.e. the same number and types of figures should be displayed for each country) we partially followed the reviewer&#x02019;s advice. Specifically, in the revised version of the manuscript, the correlation plots for all three countries are produced using the same color map, aka the Spectral palette in ggplot. Furthermore, the plots for India and Mexico are drawn using the entire (-1;+1) range, as typical of Pearson&#x02019;s correlation plots. These two choices facilitate comparability across countries. However, we maintained a restricted scale (+0.95; +1) for Israel to allow for more insight, given the high values of the correlation coefficient nationwide.</p><p>The rationale behind this choice is better illustrated in the caption of Figure 9 in the revised manuscript where the differing range for Israel compared to India and Mexico is specifically pointed to the reader&#x02019;s attention. We preferred this choice compared to the other two alternatives, (a) deleting the figure for Israel, reducing consistency across countries and (b) maintaining the original scale (-1,+1), which would have led to a uniformly colored, and not informative, plot.</p><p>12. There are quite a lot of figures. It may be beneficial to condense some figures into panel figures; for example, to combine all figures for one country into a single panel figure.</p><p>To address both this comment and another comment from the other reviewer, we have now modified the figures removing the box plots for each country, thus reducing the number of plots overall.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>13.
