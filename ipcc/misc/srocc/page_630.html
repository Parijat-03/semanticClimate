Reversibility is an issue for all options that increase terrestrial carbon stock, either through increased soil carbon or changes in land cover (e.g., reforestation, afforestation), since future changes in climate or land cover could result in reduced carbon storage (Smith 2013). In addition, the bene&#64257;ts of options that improve land management (e.g., improved cropland management, improved grazing management) will cease if the practice is halted, reversing any potential bene&#64257;ts. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 735.54; y1: 745.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.54" x1="566.12">The cost of the response options varies substantially, with some options having relatively low costs (e.g., the cost of agroforestry is less than 10 USD tCO</span><span style="x0: 379.52; x1: 382.72; y0: 711.21; y1: 717.86; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="379.52" y0="711.21" x1="382.72">2</span><span style="x0: 382.71; x1: 386.93; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="382.71" y0="711.52" x1="386.93">e</span><span style="x0: 386.93; x1: 390.26; y0: 715.44; y1: 722.09; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="386.93" y0="715.44" x1="393.45">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 393.45; x1: 396.09; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="393.45" y0="711.52" x1="566.06">) while others have much higher costs (e.g.,&#160;the cost of BECCS could be as much as 250 USD tCO</span><span style="x0: 502.29; x1: 505.48; y0: 699.21; y1: 705.86; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="502.29" y0="699.21" x1="505.48">2</span><span style="x0: 505.48; x1: 509.7; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="505.48" y0="699.52" x1="509.7">e</span><span style="x0: 509.7; x1: 513.02; y0: 703.43; y1: 710.08; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="509.7" y0="703.43" x1="516.22">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 516.22; x1: 518.86; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="516.22" y0="699.52" x1="566.09">). In addition to cost, other economic barriers may prevent implementation; for example, agroforestry is a low-cost option (Smith et&#160;al. 2014), but lack of reliable &#64257;nancial support could be a barrier (Hernandez-Morcillo et&#160;al. 2018). Additionally, there are a number of reasons why even no-cost options are not adopted, including risk aversion, lack of information, market structure, externalities, and policies (Jaffe 2019).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="603.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="603.54" x1="566.1">Some of the response options have technological barriers that may limit their wide-scale application in the near term.

Institutional barriers include governance, &#64257;nancial incentives and &#64257;nancial resources. For example, the management of supply chains includes challenges related to political will within trade regimes, economic laissez-faire policies that discourage interventions in markets, and the dif&#64257;culties of coordination across economic sectors (Poulton et&#160;al. 2006; Cohen et&#160;al. 2009; Gilbert 2012). Implementation of other options, for example, BECCS, is limited by the absence of &#64257;nancial incentives.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.86; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="411.56" x1="566.07">Options like dietary change face socio-cultural barriers; while diets have changed in the past, they are deeply culturally embedded and behaviour change is extremely dif&#64257;cult to effect, even when health bene&#64257;ts are well known (Macdiarmid et&#160;al. 2018). For some options, the speci&#64257;c barrier is dependent on the region. For example, barriers to reducing food waste in industrialised countries include inconvenience, lack of &#64257;nancial incentives, lack of public awareness, and low prioritisation (Kummu et&#160;al. 2012; Graham-Rowe et&#160;al. 2014). Barriers in developing countries include reliability of transportation networks, market reliability, education, technology, capacity, and infrastructure (Kummu et&#160;al. 2012).</span></div></body></html>
