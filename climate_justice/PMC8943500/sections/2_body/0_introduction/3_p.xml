Kopnina, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>; Saxena et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). Doubts have been expressed concerning the possibility to address the UNSDGs within the planetary limits. A recurrent line of thought has been the need for transformative educational practices with focus on themes such as liberation, ethics, indigenous knowledge, and eco-centric values. Carr et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>, p. 6) acknowledge the challenges, controversies, and inconsistencies around the UNSDGS, but argue that &#8220;early childhood environmental education is where the SDGs can be distilled into theoretical, transformational and relational practices&#8221;. In this special issue, we seek to understand if and how the 17 UNSDGs can be understood both in relation to both the theory and practice of ECEC.</p>
