      <td>This Cross-Chapter Box describes the concepts of ecosystem services (ES) and Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People (NCP), and their\nimportance to land&#8211;climate interactions. ES have become a useful concept to describe the benefits that humans obtain from\necosystems and have strong relevance to sustainable land management (SLM) decisions and their outcomes, while NCP is a new\napproach championed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (explained\nbelow). It is timely that this SRCCL report includes attention to ES/NCP, as the previous Special Report on land-use, land-use change and\nforestry (LULUCF) did not make use of these concepts and focused mostly on carbon fluxes in land&#8211;climate interactions (IPCC 2000). The\nbroader mandate of SRCCL is to address climate, but also land degradation, desertification and food security issues, all of which are\nclosely linked to the provisioning of various ES/NCP, and the decision and outline for SRCCL explicitly request an examination of how\ndesertification and degradation &#8216;impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., water, soil and soil carbon and biodiversity that underpins them)&#8217;.\nAttention to ES/NCP is particularly important in discussing co-benefits, trade-offs and adverse side effects of potential climate change\nmitigation, land management, or food security response options, as many actions may have positive impacts on climate mitigation or\nfood production, but may also come with a decline in ES provisioning, or adversely impact on biodiversity (Section 6.4.3). This box\nconsiders the importance of the ES/NCP concepts, how definitions have changed over time, continuing debates over operationalisation\nand use of these ideas. It concludes by looking at how ES/NCP are treated in various chapters in this report.</td>

      <td>While the first uses of the term &#8216;ecosystem services&#8217; appeared in the 1980s (Lele et al. 2013; Mooney and Ehrlich 1997), the roots of\ninterest in ES extend back to the late 1960s and the extinction crisis, with concern that species decline might cause loss of valuable\nbenefits to humankind (King 1966; Helliwell 1969; Westman 1977). While concern over extinction was explicitly linked to biodiversity\nloss, later ideas beyond biodiversity have animated interest in ES, including the multi-functional nature of ecosystems. A seminal paper\nby Costanza et al. (1997) attempted to put an economic value on the stocks of global ES and natural capital on which humanity relied.\nAttention to ES expanded rapidly after the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005), and the linkages between ES and economic\nvaluation of these functions were addressed by the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study (TEEB 2009). The ES approach has\nincreasingly been used in global and national environmental assessments, including the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (Watson\net al. 2011), and recent and ongoing regional and global assessments organised by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (D&#237;az et al. 2015). IPBES has recently completed an assessment on land degradation and\nrestoration that addresses a range of ES issues of relevance to the SRCCL report (IPBES 2018).</td>

      <td>The MA defined ES as &#8216;the benefits that ecosystems provide to people,&#8217; and identified four broad groupings of ES: provisioning services\nsuch as food, water, or timber; regulating services that have impacts on climate, diseases or water quality, among others; cultural\nservices that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis,\nand nutrient cycling (MA 2005). The MA emphasised that people are components of ecosystems engaged in dynamic interactions,\nand particularly assessed how changes in ES might impact human well-being, such as access to basic materials for living (shelter,\nclothing, energy); health (clean air and water); social relations (including community cohesion); security (freedom from natural\ndisasters); and freedom of choice (the opportunity to achieve) (MA 2005). Upon publication of the MA, incorporation of ES into\nland-use change assessments increased dramatically, including studies on how to maximise provisioning of ES alongside human\nwell-being (Carpenter et al. 2009); how intensive food production to feed growing populations required trading off a number of\nimportant ES (Foley et al. 2005); and how including ES in general circulation models indicated increasing vulnerability to ES change or\nloss in future climate scenarios (Schr&#246;ter et al. 2005).</td>

      <td>Starting in 2015, IPBES introduced a new related concept to ES, that of Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People (NCP), which are defined as &#8216;all\nthe contributions, both positive and negative, of living nature (i.e., diversity of organisms, ecosystems and their associated ecological\nand evolutionary processes) to the quality of life of people&#8217; (D&#237;az et al. 2018). NCP are divided into regulating NCP, non-material NCP,\nand material NCP, a different approach than used by the MA (see Figure 1). However, IPBES has stressed that NCP are a particular way\nto think of ES, rather than a replacement for ES. The concept of NCP is proposed to be a broader umbrella to engage a wider range\nof scholarship &#8211; particularly from the social sciences and humanities &#8211; and a wider range of values, from intrinsic to instrumental to\nrelational &#8211; particularly those held by indigenous peoples and local communities (Redford and Adams 2009; Schr&#246;ter et al. 2014; Pascual\net al. 2017; D&#237;az et al. 2018). The differences between the MA and IPBES approaches can be seen in Table 1.</td>
