While all classes of any grade including primary schools can participate in the PCS, the pilot study specifically targeted adolescents. We therefore recruited a convenience sample of classes covering grades 7 to 13 (mostly attended by adolescents aged 12 to 19 years) to participate in the pilot study. With the aim of preparing a pragmatic effectiveness study, we did not specify further inclusion or exclusion criteria for classes. In October 2021, using the newsletter of the PCS, we invited all 7500 schools in 14 federal states as well as 64 schools that had participated in previous PCS and were registered for the present PCS to participate in the pilot study. By 19 November 2021, twelve classes from five schools had consented to participate in the pilot study. </p>
