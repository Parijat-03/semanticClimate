For example, while twitter.com ranks first in the children, teens, and elderly's networks, cnn.com places first in the adults' networks. In contrast, co.uk takes fourth in all groups' networks. On the other hand, some domains for specific age groups rank high in the group networks. For instance, Techfordaddy.com, which provides useful parenting information for fathers, ranks third in the children's networks, and slj.com, which covers a wide variety of topics with a focus on technology, multimedia, and other information resources that arouse the interest of young learners in school, places second in the teens' networks.</p>
