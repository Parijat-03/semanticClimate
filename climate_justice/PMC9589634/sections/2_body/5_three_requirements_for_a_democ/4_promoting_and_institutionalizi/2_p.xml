One recent example of this is the proliferation of &#8216;Climate Assemblies&#8217; in many countries across Europe. They can help to ensure the representation of diverse social perspectives when it comes to weighing the political implications of complex issues and to reflecting on the aforementioned value judgments experts oftentimes have to make in crafting useful advice. This is especially important since the composition of expert bodies is usually not particularly diverse in socioeconomic terms, which can lead to blind spots regarding the real-life consequences of recommendations for certain social groups (Moore and MacKenzie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>).</p>
