Instead, the distinction was made concrete by referring to goals that are most commonly associated with mitigation and adaptation (reducing climate change through CO2 reduction versus protection from flooding, drought and forest fires). This was particularly important since many of the participants in the Global Climate Strikes were experiencing their first engagement with climate politics (de Moor, de Vydt, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). The items therefore also did not specify the means by which these goals should be achieved&#8212;e.g. through conservative or transformational measures. While specifying this may have been relevant from a theoretical point of view, doing so would have risked reducing the understandability of the survey question. Furthermore, the immense data collection effort yielding the current number of interviews was only possible through a large international collaborative effort, which meant that the space available in our survey for each team involved was limited. Surveys that are too long reduce data quality significantly (Dillman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Hence, we could only dedicate space for one question to measure support for mitigation and adaptation.</p>
