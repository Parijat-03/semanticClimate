International environmental agreements, intergovernmental agencies, and rules of cooperation to address specific sustainability problems are at the core of such institutionalist responses to the planetary crisis. In this view, institutional interventions are the first recourse also against social and environmental excesses of laissez-faire capitalism. In principle, global institutions can enshrine rights that protect the poor and advance their interests, especially when these institutions are based on multilateral agreements and strong involvement of the countries in the Global South (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kotz&#233;, 2019b</xref>). For example, the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities in the 1992 climate convention can be seen as a reflection of international justice (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Klinsky and Gupta, 2019</xref>). Even so, in many global environmental regimes, considerations of social justice do not have the same legal force and political commitment as do market-based institutional arrangements (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kashwan, 2017a</xref>). Furthermore, many institutionalist research programs remain focused on the goal of effective protection of the global environment&#8212;and not on increasing justice at the same time. That said, in times of a global capitalist economy, growing nationalism and populism, and the rise of a multipolar order with multiple conflicting centers of power, global institutions still seem indispensable in a progressive agenda to advance the interests of the global poor within planetary stewardship (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Biermann, 2014</xref>).</p>
