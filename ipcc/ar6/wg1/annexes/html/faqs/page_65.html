There is strong evidence that characteristics of many individual extreme events have already changed because of human-driven changes to the climate system. Some types of highly impactful extreme weather events have occurred more often and have become more severe due to these human influences. As the climate continues to warm, the observed changes in the probability and/or magnitude of some extreme weather events will continue as the human influences on these events increase. </span></div><div left="74.41" right="545.2" top="576.22"><span x0="74.41" y0="576.22" x1="545.2" style="x0: 74.41; x1: 76.91; y0: 576.22; y1: 585.22; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">It is common to question whether human-caused climate change caused a&#160;major weather- and climate-related disaster. When extreme weather and climate events do occur, both exposure and vulnerability play an important role in determining the magnitude and impacts of the resulting disaster. As such, it is difficult to attribute a&#160;specific disaster directly to climate change. However, the relatively new science of event attribution enables scientists to attribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes. Scientists cannot answer directly whether a&#160;particular event was caused by climate change, as extremes do occur naturally, and any specific weather and climate event is the result of a&#160;complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists quantify the relative importance of human and natural influences on the magnitude and/or probability of specific extreme weather events. Such information is important for disaster risk reduction planning, because improved knowledge about changes in the probability and magnitude of relevant extreme events enables better quantification of disaster risks.</span></div><div left="74.41" right="545.18" top="450.25"><span x0="74.41" y0="450.25" x1="545.18" style="x0: 74.41; x1: 81.41; y0: 450.25; y1: 459.25; width: 7.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">On a&#160;case-by-case basis, scientists can now quantify the contribution of human influences to the magnitude and probability of many extreme events. This is done by estimating and comparing the probability or magnitude of the same type of event between the current climate&#160;&#8211; including the increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and other human influences&#160;&#8211; and an alternate world where the atmospheric greenhouse gases remained at pre-industrial levels. FAQ 11.3 Figure&#160;1&#160;illustrates this approach using differences in temperature and probability between the two scenarios as an example. Both the pre-industrial (blue) and current (red) climates experience hot extremes, but with different probabilities and magnitudes. Hot extremes of a&#160;given temperature have a&#160;higher probability of occurrence in the warmer current climate than in the cooler pre-industrial climate. Additionally, an extreme hot event of a&#160;particular probability will be warmer in the current climate than in the pre-industrial climate. Climate model simulations are often used to estimate the occurrence of a&#160;specific event in both climates. The change in the magnitude and/or probability of the extreme event in the current climate compared to the pre-industrial climate is attributed to the difference between the two scenarios, which is the human influence.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="545.2" top="180.31"><span x0="315.21" y0="180.31" x1="545.2" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.71; y0: 180.31; y1: 189.31; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Attributable increases in probability and magnitude have been identified consistently for many hot extremes. Attributable increases have also been found for some extreme precipitation events, including hurricane rainfall events, but these results can vary among events. In some cases, large natural variations in the climate system prevent attributing changes in the probability or magnitude of a&#160;specific extreme to human influence. Additionally, attribution of certain classes of extreme weather (e.g.,&#160;tornadoes) is beyond </span></div><div left="79.89" right="126.79" top="392.68"><span x0="79.89" y0="392.68" x1="126.79" style="x0: 79.89; x1: 85.98; y0: 392.68; y1: 402.95; width: 6.09; font-size: 10.27; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.516, 0.431, 0.431, 0.075]; font-family: LAGTEC+ArialMT;">FAQ 11.3: </span><span style="x0: 126.79; x1: 133.98; y0: 392.16; y1: 402.43; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.27; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.516, 0.431, 0.431, 0.075]; font-family: NDFFGY+Arial-BoldMT;" x0="126.79" y0="392.16" x1="296.26">Climate change and extreme events</span></div><div left="80.32" right="300.01" top="380.86"><span x0="80.32" y0="380.86" x1="300.01" style="x0: 80.32; x1: 85.45; y0: 380.86; y1: 388.57; width: 5.14; font-size: 7.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0.516, 0.431, 0.431, 0.075]; font-family: LAGTEC+ArialMT;">Extreme events have become more probable and more intense.
