<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> lists the per capita atmospheric annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 2018, the most recent year for which data are available. Unfortunately, these data do not provide a cumulative total for the countries in the European Union, as does <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> on largest historical emitters of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Given the major differences in countries&#8217; populations, it is important to consider per capita emissions so that large-population middle-income countries such as China and India are not unduly penalized. In <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the order of responsibility for current emissions is quite different from the order in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> on largest historical emitters. The 10 highest per capita atmospheric emitters are Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Australia, the United States, Canada, South Korea, the Russian Federation, Japan, Germany, and Poland. We believe that these countries, particularly those near the top of the list, should also be major contributors to climate reparations funding.</p>
