Charles C. Mann in his book &#8216;The Wizard and the Prophet<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref>&#8217; uses the story of two ground-breaking American scientists, William Vogt and Norman Borlaug, to illustrate the fundamentally opposing views of the world and our environmental crisis. Norman Borlaug, the Wizard, very much like Bill Gates, regarded technology, along with the constant ability of humans to innovate, as a panacea that will cure every ill, whereas William Vogt envisages the future of this planet, as a much darker and more dysfunctional, in which humans have destroyed the environment and superheated the climate. In many ways, when I read Bill Gates&#8217;s book, it felt like all we need to do is trust in technology and our <italic>Star Trek</italic>-style future will be assured, whereas many non-billionaires see <italic>Blade Runner</italic> as the more likely future. I think it is this lack of genuine confrontation with the real human issues in the book that makes it much less powerful than it could have been.</p>
