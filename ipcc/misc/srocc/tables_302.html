      <td>Drought is a highly complex natural hazard (for floods, see Box 7.2). It is difficult to precisely identify its start and end. It is usually slow\nand gradual (Wilhite and Pulwarty 2017), but sometimes can evolve rapidly (Ford and Labosier 2017; Mo and Lettenmaier 2015). It is\ncontext-dependent, but its impacts are diffuse, both direct and indirect, short-term and long-term (Few and Tebboth 2018; Wilhite and\nPulwarty 2017). Following the Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), drought is defined here as &#8220;a period\nof abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance&#8221; (Mach et al. 2014). Although drought is considered\nabnormal relative to the water availability under the mean climatic characteristics, it is also a recurrent element of any climate, not\nonly in drylands, but also in humid areas (Cook et al. 2014b; Seneviratne and Ciais 2017; Spinoni et al. 2019; T&#252;rke&#351; 1999; Wilhite et al.\n2014). Climate change is projected to increase the intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions across the world (for a detailed\nassessment see Section 2.2, and IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018)). Droughts often\namplify the effects of unsustainable land management practices, especially in drylands, leading to land degradation (Cook et al. 2009;\nHornbeck 2012). Especially in the context of climate change, the recurrent nature of droughts requires proactively planned policy\ninstruments both to be well-prepared to respond to droughts when they occur and also undertake ex ante actions to mitigate their\nimpacts by strengthening societal resilience against droughts (Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017).</td>

      <td>Droughts are among the costliest of natural hazards (robust evidence, high agreement). According to the International Disaster\nDatabase (EM-DAT), droughts affected more than 1.1 billion people between 1994 and 2013, with the recorded global economic\ndamage of 787 billion USD (CRED 2015), corresponding to an average of 41.4 billion USD per year. Drought losses in the agricultural\nsector alone in developing countries were estimated to equal 29 billion USD between 2005 and 2015 (FAO 2018). Usually, these\nestimates capture only direct and on-site costs of droughts. However, droughts have also wide-ranging indirect and off-site impacts,\nwhich are seldom quantified. These indirect impacts are both biophysical and socio-economic, with poor households and communities\nbeing particularly exposed to them (Winsemius et al. 2018). Droughts affect not only water quantity, but also water quality (Mosley\n2014). The costs of these water quality impacts are yet to be adequately quantified. Socio-economic indirect impacts of droughts\nare related to food insecurity, poverty, lowered health and displacement (Gray and Mueller 2012; Johnstone and Mazo 2011; Linke\net al. 2015; Lohmann and Lechtenfeld 2015; Maystadt and Ecker 2014; Yusa et al. 2015) (Section 3.4.2.9 and Box 5.5), which are\ndifficult to quantify comprehensively. Research is required for developing methodologies that could allow for more comprehensive\nassessment of these indirect drought costs. Such methodologies require the collection of highly granular data, which is currently\nlacking in many countries due to high costs of data collection. However, the opportunities provided by remotely sensed data and\nnovel analytical methods based on big data and artificial intelligence, including use of citizen science for data collection, could help\nin reducing these gaps.</td>

      <td>There are three broad (and sometimes overlapping) policy approaches for responding to droughts (Section 7.4.8). These approaches\nare often pursued simultaneously by many governments. Firstly, responding to drought when it occurs by providing direct drought\nrelief, known as crisis management. Crisis management is also the costliest among policy approaches to droughts because it often\nincentivises the continuation of activities vulnerable to droughts (Botterill and Hayes 2012; Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017).</td>

      <td>The second approach involves development of drought preparedness plans, which coordinate the policies for providing relief measures\nwhen droughts occur. For example, combining resources to respond to droughts at regional level in Sub-Saharan Africa was found to\nbe more cost-effective than separate individual country drought relief funding (Clarke and Hill 2013). Effective drought preparedness\nplans require well-coordinated and integrated government actions &#8211; a key lesson learnt from 2015 to 2017 during drought response\nin Cape Town, South Africa (Visser 2018). Reliable, relevant and timely climate and weather information helps respond to droughts\nappropriately (Sivakumar and Ndiang&#8217;ui 2007). Improved knowledge and integration of weather and climate information can be\nachieved by strengthening drought early warning systems at different scales (Verbist et al. 2016). Every USD invested into strengthening\nhydro-meteorological and early warning services in developing countries was found to yield between 4 and 35 USD (Hallegatte\n2012). Improved access and coverage by drought insurance, including index insurance, can help alleviate the impacts of droughts on\nlivelihoods (Guerrero-Baena et al. 2019; Kath et al. 2019; Osgood et al. 2018; Ruiz et al. 2015; Tadesse et al. 2015).</td>
