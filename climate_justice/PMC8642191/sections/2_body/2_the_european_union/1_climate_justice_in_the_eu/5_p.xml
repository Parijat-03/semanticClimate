The participation of civil society groups has long been important to the crafting of EU climate policy (Derman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>, 28ff). Stakeholder participation is being further institutionalised through the European Climate Pact (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>) and Member State initiatives such as France&#8217;s Citizens&#8217; Convention for the Climate. Moreover, as part of the EGD, the Aarhus Regulation may be revised &#8216;to improve access to administrative and judicial review at EU level for citizens and NGOs&#8217; (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>, 23).</p>
