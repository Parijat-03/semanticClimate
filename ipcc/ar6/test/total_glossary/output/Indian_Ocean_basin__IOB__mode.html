<h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">Indian Ocean basin </h4>
<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A mode of interannual variability characterized by a temporal alternation of basin-wide warming and cooling of the Indian Ocean sea surface. It mostly develops in response to <em>El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO)</em>, but often persists after ENSOâs equatorial eastern Pacific signal has dissipated. The IOB affects atmospheric circulation, temperature, and precipitation in South, South East, and East Asia as well as Africa, and modulates <em>tropical cyclone</em> activity in the north western Pacific. See Section AIV.2.4 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></dd>
