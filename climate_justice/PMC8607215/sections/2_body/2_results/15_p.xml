These features might be seen as a narrow description of the (non-human) environment, and if one seeks to advance the rights of the young generation in this regard, then an overarching interpretation might be needed. Such clarification will encompass a consideration of the cultural, economic, and social interaction of man with the esthetic, chemical, and physical properties of the natural environment. In light of the country&#8217;s oppressive past and its vision for the future, this interpretation is appropriate as the environment does not merely shape one&#8217;s perception about life, but affects one&#8217;s health and mortality, particularly in the context of pollution. An almost identical position was adopted by Ngcobo J when he noted that economic development and ecological stresses are inexorably linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. He further avers that since socio-economic development is vital for the realization of basic rights, any development which is detrimental to the environment ultimately impacts these rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To that end, section&#160;24(b)(iii) highlights the inextricable link between ecological protection and human development when it underscores that the state ought to pursue 'ecologically sustainable development&#8217; as a conduit for 'promoting justifiable economic and social development'. To a great extent, the Constitution could be said to be far-sighted when it drew from the Brundtland Commission and acknowledged SD, which was later rebranded as sustainable development goals nearly two decades later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The notion of SD, as set out under section&#160;24 of the Constitution, therefore, highlights the interrelationship between ecological conservation, social needs, and economic advancement.</p>
