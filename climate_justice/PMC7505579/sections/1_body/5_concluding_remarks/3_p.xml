In the case of human behaviour and the purpose of understanding it, science can benefit from insights from the agents themselves. Society can also gain from such an agenda: not only can citizens have some grasp of science by gaining access to how knowledge is produced <xref rid="b0960" ref-type="bibr">[192]</xref>, but they can also be a part of the knowledge production (or &#8220;co-construction&#8221; <xref rid="b0965" ref-type="bibr">[193]</xref>) and help co-define the policy agenda, thereby gaining greater control over the decisions that affect their lives <xref rid="b0970" ref-type="bibr">[194]</xref>. And the policy perspective can take on a political ecology agenda, committed to big changes with citizens and ecology at the heart, with hope and imagination fuelling new forms of governance.</p>
