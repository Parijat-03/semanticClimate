Indeed, during the post-Lushan earthquake reconstruction, social workers collaborated with architects and urban planners, promoting the local skilled workers&#8217; engagement in the post-earthquake reconstruction of housing and communities [<xref rid="B33-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These micro- and macro-level interdisciplinary collaborations accelerated the post-earthquake recovery and stimulated the grassroots efforts to support the post-earthquake trauma relief and protect community-based cultural heritage [<xref rid="B34-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After the EF4 tornado in Alabama (2019), Holmes and colleagues reported that social workers collaborated with anthropologists to employ an interdisciplinary policy analysis and political-economic critique approach, stimulate the macro-level dialogue, and identify the deep-seated causes of human and economic loss caused by the tornado [<xref rid="B35-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although these GSW practices powerfully demonstrate the need for social workers to engage with multidisciplinary professionals in disaster settings, GSW training to raise the students&#8217; interdisciplinary awareness remains under-researched.</p>
