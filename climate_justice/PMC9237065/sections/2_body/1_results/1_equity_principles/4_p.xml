The expansion of renewables could indicate increased ability to reduce emissions relative to other countries, whether due to circumstances such as advantageous natural resources or technological know-how resulting from early adoption and the consequent ability to efficiently expand the use of renewable energy sources (RES) in the future (first-mover advantage). In that sense, RES expansion could be interpreted as an indicator of capability; when countries have succeeded in improving emission efficiency by means of implementing renewables, they could be considered more capable of further reducing emissions and, thus, should be allocated a smaller share of the remaining budget. We thus include an interpretation placing greater emission reductions on countries most likely able to meet such demands, as represented by recent development of RES (<italic>C4-RES-cap</italic>).</p>
