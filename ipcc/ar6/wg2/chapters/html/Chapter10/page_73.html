In Asia, climate-related disasters have become more recurrent and destructive in terms of both economic and social impacts (Bhatt et&#160;al., 2015; Aich et&#160;al., 2017; Vij et&#160;al., 2017). Projections of increasing frequency, intensity and severity of climate-related disasters call for better integration of CCA and DRR (Sapountzaki, 2018) in policy development to address risks efficiently (Rahman et&#160;al., 2018) and to promote sustainable development pathways for reduced vulnerability and increased resilience (Seidler et&#160;al., 2018). Connecting CCA and DRR efforts in both policy and practice continue to be a challenge, however, because the convergence of national policy and planning processes on CCA and DRR within Asia is in its early stages (Cousins, 2014) and structural barriers persist (Mall et&#160;al., 2019). Both CCA and DRR have developed as separate policy domains because of the different temporal and spatial scales considered, the diversity of actors involved, the policies and institutional frameworks adopted and the differences in tools and methodological approaches used. This has resulted in the CCA and DRR communities, and the knowledge and research they produce to support planning and decision making, not always being well connected (Street et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="125.12" top="402.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="402.48" x1="125.12" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.2 Findings</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.71" top="378.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="378.6" x1="307.71" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.24; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate risk management in Asia is approached by focusing on hazards that are associated with extremes (i.e., extreme weather events with increased frequency and severity) as well as climate- and weather-related events. For example, farming has been affected by climatic variability and change in a wide variety of ways that include an increase in drought periods and intensity, a shortage of irrigation water availability, an increase in flooding and landslides, pest infestation of crops, a rising number of crop diseases, the introduction of invasive species and crop weeds, land degradation and an overall reduction in crop yields (Khanal et&#160;al., 2019). Estimation of the number of daily patients of heat-related illness based on the weather data and newly introduced metrics shows that the effects of age, successive days and heat adaptation are key variables (Kodera et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.68" top="210.62"><span x0="54.14" y0="210.62" x1="307.68" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.07; y0: 210.62; y1: 220.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Because most developing countries in Asia are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to a number of factors, many studies have focused on understanding vulnerability, for instance, gendered vulnerability at the micro scale, which limits capacity to respond to both climatic and socioeconomic stressors (Ferdous and Mallick, 2019); vulnerability of urban poor communities due to the interaction of environmental and social factors (e.g., low incomes, gender, migrant status) and heightens the impacts of climate change on the poor (Porio, 2014); social&#8211;ecological vulnerability where a degraded environment influences hazard patterns and vulnerability of people (Depietri, 2020); and livelihood vulnerability due to perceived climate risks and adaptation constraints (Fahad and Wang, 2018; Hossain et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.73" top="714.64"><span x0="318.18" y0="714.64" x1="571.73" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.93; y0: 714.64; y1: 724.14; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">flood (Al Saud, 2015; Al-Amin et&#160;al., 2019; Jha and Gundimeda, 2019; Mahmood et&#160;al., 2019; Zhang et&#160;al., 2019e), drought (Guo et&#160;al., 2019; Mainali et&#160;al., 2019), rainfall-induced landslide (Li et&#160;al., 2019b), SLR (Imaduddina and Subagyo, 2014; Suroso and Firman, 2018) and heat stress (Onosuka et&#160;al., 2019), among others, as well as environmental assessment, for example, in coastal zones (Islam and Zhang, 2019).

For example, Filho et&#160;al. (2019) assessed adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change based on urban poverty, infrastructure and community facilities; Mabon et&#160;al. (2019) looked at adaptation via the built environment, green roofs, and citizen and private-sector involvement in smaller-scale greening actions; Lama and Becker (2019) focused on adaptation to reduce risk in conflicts; Banwell et&#160;al. (2018) studied the link between health, CCA and DRR; and Izumi et&#160;al. (2019) surveyed science, technology and innovation for DRR. Vulnerable groups have been given much attention, such as farmers (Afroz, 2017; Gupta et&#160;al., 2019; Jawid and Khadjavi, 2019; Khanal et&#160;al., 2019; Shi et&#160;al., 2019a), women (Goodrich et&#160;al., 2019; Hossain et&#160;al., 2019; Udas et&#160;al., 2019), and children, elderly and refugees (Asia, 2017). Finally, issues identified include water resource management (Bhatta et&#160;al., 2019; Sen et&#160;al., 2019; Zhang et&#160;al., 2019a); food security (Aleksandrova et&#160;al., 2016; Le, 2016); disaster governance (Blanco, 2015); climate boundary shifting wherein impacts of climate change are significant for crop production, soil management and DRR (Talchabhadel and Karki, 2019); and institutional dimensions of CCA (Cuevas, 2018; Islam et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="222.71"><span x0="318.18" y0="222.71" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.29; y0: 222.71; y1: 232.21; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Case studies on climate risk management and integrated CCA and DRR actions highlight some key lessons including: an integrated and transformative approach to CCA, which focuses on long-term changes in addressing climate impacts (Filho et&#160;al., 2019); adoption of an adaptive flood risk management framework incorporating both risk observation and public perceptions (Al-Amin et&#160;al., 2019); a holistic approach and non-structural and technological measures in flood control management (Chan, 2014); monitoring of changes in urban surface water in relation to changes in seasons, land covers, anthropogenic activities and topographic characteristics for managing watersheds and urban planning (Faridatul et&#160;al., 2019); removing &#8216;gender blindness&#8217; in agrobiodiversity conservation and adaptation policies (Ravera et&#160;al., 2019); understanding uncertainties in CCA and DRR at the local level (van der Keur et&#160;al., 2016; Djalante and Lassa, 2019); promoting the use of IKLK alongside scientific knowledge </span></div></body></html>
