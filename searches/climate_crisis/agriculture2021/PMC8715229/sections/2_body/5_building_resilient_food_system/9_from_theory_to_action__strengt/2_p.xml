Our interconnected world is confronted with complex, intricate problems, multiple shocks playing out simultaneously, compounding vulnerabilities, and non-linear dynamics. This has implications not only decision-making processes, but also for the way that underlying scientific knowledge constructed. As the pandemic illustrates, the barriers between scientific disciplines must be broken down if we are to arrive at a more integrated understanding of the challenges that confront us and the solutions we need as society (<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Moradian et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Leach et al., 2021</xref>). Not only is greater collaboration across scientific disciplines called for; so too is strengthening the involvement of stakeholders, including decision makers, the private sector, civil society, and citizens at large. The challenge will be to make the scientific process more transparent and accessible at a time when it also becoming more complex.</p>
