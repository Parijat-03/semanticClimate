      <td>and projected changes. (a) Global surface temperature over the Holocene divided into three time scales: (i) 12,000 to 1000 years ago (10,000 BCE to 1000 CE)\nin 100-year time steps, (ii) 1000 to 1900 CE, 10-year smooth, and (iii) 1900 to 2020 CE (mean of four datasets in panel c). Bold lines show the median of the\nmulti-method reconstruction, with 5% and 95% percentiles of the ensemble members (thin lines). Vertical bars are 5&#8211;95th percentile ranges of estimated global\nsurface temperature for the Last Interglacial and mid-Holocene (medium confidence) (Section 2.3.1.1). All temperatures are relative to 1850&#8211;1900. (b) Spatially\nresolved trends (&#176;C per decade) for (upper map) HadCRUTv5 over 1981&#8211;2020, and (lower map, total change) multi-model mean projected changes from 1995&#8211;2014\nto 2081&#8211;2010 in the SST3-7.0 scenario. Observed trends have been calculated where data are present in both the first and last decade and for at least 70% of all\nyears within the period using ordinary least squares. Significance is assessed with autoregressive AR(1) model correction and denoted by stippling. Hatched areas\nin the lower map show areas of conflicting model evidence on significance of changes. (c) Temperature from instrumental data for 1850&#8211;2020, including annually\nresolved averages for the four global surface temperature datasets assessed in Section 2.3.1.1.3 (see text for references). The grey shading shows the uncertainty\nassociated with the HadCRUTv5 estimate. All temperatures are relative to the 1850&#8211;1900 reference period. (d) Recent past and 2015&#8211;2050 evolution of annual mean\nglobal surface temperature change relative to 1850&#8211;1900, from HadCRUTv5 (black), Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical simulations\n(up to 2014, in grey, ensemble mean solid, 5% and 95% percentiles dashed, individual models thin), and CMIP6 projections under scenario SSP2-4.5, from four\nmodels that have an equilibrium climate sensitivity near the assessed central value (thick yellow). Solid thin coloured lines show the assessed central estimate of\n20-year change in global surface temperature for 2015&#8211;2050 under three scenarios, and dashed thin coloured lines the corresponding 5% and 95% quantiles. (e)\nAssessed projected change in 20-year running mean global surface temperature for five scenarios (central estimate solid, very likely range shaded for SSP1-2.6 and\nSSP3-7.0), relative to 1995&#8211;2014 (left y-axis) and 1850&#8211;1900 (right y-axis). The y-axis on the right-hand side is shifted upward by 0.85&#176;C, the central estimate of the\nobserved warming for 1995&#8211;2014, relative to 1850&#8211;1900. The right y-axis in (e) is the same as the y-axis in (d). {2.3, 4.3, 4.4}</td>

      <td>During the near term (2021&#8211;2040), a 1.5&#176;C increase in global surface temperature, relative to 1850&#8211;1900, is very likely to occur\nin scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely than not to occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and\nSSP1-2.6. The time of crossing a warming level is defined here as the midpoint of the first 20-year period during which the average\nglobal surface temperature exceeds the level. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of crossing the 1.5&#176;C\nlevel lies in the early 2030s. This is in the early part of the likely range (2030&#8211;2052) assessed in SR1.5, which assumed continuation of\nthe then-current warming rate; this rate has been confirmed in the AR6. Roughly half of this difference arises from a larger historical\nwarming diagnosed in AR6. The other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger\nwarming over the near term than was estimated as &#8216;current&#8217; in SR1.5 (medium confidence). When considering scenarios similar to SSP1-\n1.9 instead of linear extrapolation, the SR1.5 estimate of when 1.5&#176;C global warming is crossed is close to the central estimate reported\nhere.

      <td>It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, global surface temperature relative to 1850&#8211;1900 will remain below 1.6&#176;C throughout\nthe 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot of 1.5&#176;C global warming of no more than 0.1&#176;C. If climate sensitivity lies\nnear the lower end of the assessed very likely range, crossing the 1.5&#176;C warming level is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6\n(medium confidence). Global surface temperature in any individual year, in contrast to the 20-year average, could by 2030 exceed\n1.5&#176;C relative to 1850&#8211;1900 with a likelihood between 40% and 60%, across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence).\n(Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1) {4.3.4, 4.4.1, Box 4.1, 7.5}</td>
