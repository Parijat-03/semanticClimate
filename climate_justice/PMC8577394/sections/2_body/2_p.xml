The East Side Coastal Resilience (ESCR) Project, one of the world&#8217;s largest and most expensive coastal protection projects, aims to rebuild a climate-resilient version of East River Park, a long, narrow, green stretch between FDR Drive and the East River in lower Manhattan. The goal, at the price of $1.45 billion, is to raze and lift the current park by eight or ten feet to form a protective flood barrier. The new park would insulate the neighborhood from future sea level rise while remodeling the public amenity, and would represent the first phase of a planned total remake of Manhattan&#8217;s coastline in the wake of 2012&#8217;s Superstorm Sandy. Owing to the desires of high-profile architects to experiment with novel ways of designing flood infrastructure, and later, Mayor de Blasio&#8217;s expressed commitment to public participation in city policy, the process of imagining the infrastructure project was to be &#8220;radically inclusive.&#8221; During the first phase of the project&#8217;s planning &#8211; the design phase &#8211; residents participated in intensive rounds of workshops, design charettes, and public hearings, and reported being satisfied with the process. Indeed, through what architects called an &#8220;iterative design process,&#8221; participants continuously recognized their inputs reflected in the evolution of visual renderings and sketches for the infrastructure project.</p>
