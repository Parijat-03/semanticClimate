      <td>In flood-prone cities, such as Mumbai, access\nto flood shelters is pivotal to ensure the safety\nof lives, effective evacuation and emergency\nresponse measures.\nUnderserved populations living far from flood\nshelters are more vulnerable during flood events\nwhen road access is compromised. The\npopulation having a flood shelter within 1km\nof walking distance potentially declines, from\n75.9% on a regular day to 46.5% during a flood\nevent. People living in temporary structures in\ndense informal settlements are more vulnerable\nowing to the high likelihood of the structure\ncollapsing, giving lesser time to react.</td>
