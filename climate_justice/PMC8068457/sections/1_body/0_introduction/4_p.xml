The justice and equity discussion has always been present in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), often articulated under the &#8220;common, but differentiated, responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR&amp;RC)&#8221; (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1992</xref>). The text of the PA, Article 2.2, establishes that the agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the CBDR&amp;RC principle. The mitigation section, in Article 4.1, clearly states that the long-term temperature goal should be achieved on the basis of equity (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>).</p>
