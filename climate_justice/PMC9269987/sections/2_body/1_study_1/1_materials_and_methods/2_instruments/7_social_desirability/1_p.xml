<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To detect test falsification due to positive self-presentation and socially desirable response tendencies, the short version of social desirability scale (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Satow, 2012</xref>) was used. The participants answered two items on a 4-point scale and thus the sum score ranged from 2 to 8. A value of 7 or higher indicated a high tendency to distort self-presentation and it is thus recommended to exclude participants scoring 7 or higher. Based on this criterion, we had to exclude 12 participants prior to the analysis. The final sample consisted of <italic>N</italic> = 174 participants, as described above.</p>
