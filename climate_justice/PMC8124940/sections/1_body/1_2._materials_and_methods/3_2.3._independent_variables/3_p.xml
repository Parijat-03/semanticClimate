<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We utilized four additional variables from the 2011 Houselisting and Housing Census. These included the proportion of households having availability of assets (television, computer/laptop, telephone/mobile phone, or scooter/car), those with electricity as the main lighting source, those living in a house they own, and those with household size of nine persons or higher. The availability of specified assets and electricity in the household can be expected to reflect both higher economic status and ability to mitigate heat exposure [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although home ownership has been linked to greater wealth or assets in U.S. urban areas, its interpretation in India has to be nuanced to accommodate the contextual specificities of housing markets [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Owning houses in the NCT of Delhi is potentially associated with households involved in agricultural occupations which can include low and middle income households. New migrants with well-paying jobs can reside in rental housing units in economically affluent wards with lower heat exposure and greater proximity to greenspace. Finally, households with nine or more persons potentially reflected higher levels of crowding and lower economic affluence. However, the possible presence of higher income households residing in large family owned compounds could influence the relationship between larger household sizes and lower socioeconomic status.</p>
