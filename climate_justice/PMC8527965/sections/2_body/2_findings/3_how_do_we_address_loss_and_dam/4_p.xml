Particular attention to the interactions within the socio-ecological system, and flow-on effects to Pasifika wellbeing, livelihoods and culture, among other elements need to be embedded into both biodiversity and ecosystem services assessments as well as research around loss in the Pacific, which is lacking to date (McNamara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>). These assessments need to incorporate social science expertise, appreciating that biodiversity loss has direct links to other cascading losses that need to be captured and focused on. Only through holistic assessments of loss can the true picture of direct impacts, losses and damages be accounted for and the opportunity costs of action and notions of triage be considered. In order to be holistic, these assessments must also gain understandings at a grassroots scale through incorporating local perspectives and using bottom-up approaches.</p>
