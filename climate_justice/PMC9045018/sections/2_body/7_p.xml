Melissa is an eminent and prolific scholar-researcher-practitioner who maintains an abiding belief in the efficacy of clinical social work. As my leg of the race concludes, I am excited for the next chapter of the <italic>CSWJ</italic>, and confident that Melissa will be dedicated to the task at hand. I am also confident that Melissa can count on you to support her vision for the <italic>CSWJ.</italic></p>
