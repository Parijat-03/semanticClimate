The fourth-generation science museum is, in our view, bold, innovative, and forward thinking, and carries possibilities for promoting civic engagement, activism, and change. We recognize that fourth-generation science museums, alongside their critical and agential practices (whether they be exhibitions or other curatorial displays, programs, forums, science caf&#233;s, outreach, coalitions, and community work), carry their own set of challenges and narratives, particularly when approaching controversy. However, the time for change has come.</p>
