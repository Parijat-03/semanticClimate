<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Liu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) found that both the surface and canopy UHI were reduced during the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown. This was initially counterintuitive to me because our study (Jin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) found that aerosols can reduce urban surface temperature. That finding would suggest that reduced human&#8208;caused aerosols in the atmosphere because of the lockdown might lead to an enhanced UHI. Liu et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) has renewed my thinking about the particular role of aerosols in surface temperature, and that topic should be examined perhaps using the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown perspective. It would be particularly interesting to understand the relative changes and distribution of scattering aerosols in the urban &#8211; rural environment during the lockdown periods.</p>
