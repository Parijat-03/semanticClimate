This is not to say that progress has not been made in keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement, as more major corporations, financial institutions, cities, and even countries throughout the world see the urgent need for increased climate action and mitigation strategies. Even if it is too late to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, there is still plenty of work to be done to make sure that warming levels do not rise even further, approaching 3 and 4 degrees Celsius, which would put not only human civilization at extreme risk but also, more fundamentally, the general sustainability of human life.</p>
