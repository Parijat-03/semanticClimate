One study in Indonesia found that thenet present value of an oil palm plantation is between&#160;3,835 and&#160;9,630&#160;USD per ha to land owners (Butler et al. 2009). High &#64257;nancial returns are creating incentives for the expansion of smallholder production in peatlands. Smallholder plantations extend over 22% of the peatlands in insular Southeast Asia compared to 27% for industrial plantations (Miettinen et al. 2016).

Experience from northern latitudes suggests that extensive damage and changes in hydrological conditions mean that restoration in many cases is unachievable (Andersen et al. 2017). In the case of Southeast Asia, where peatlands form as raised bogs, drainage leads to collapse of the dome, and this collapse cannot be reversed by rewetting. Nevertheless, efforts are underway to develop solutions, or at least partial solutions in Southeast Asia, for example, by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency. The &#64257;rst step is to restore the hydrological regime in drained peatlands, but so far experiences with canal blocking and re&#64258;ooding of the peat have been only partially successful (Ritzema et al. 2014). Market incentives with certi&#64257;cation through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil have also not been particularly successful as many concessions seek certi&#64257;cation only after signi&#64257;cant environmental degradation has occurred (Carlson et al. 2017). Certi&#64257;cation had no discernible effect on forest loss or &#64257;re detection in peatlands in Indonesia. To date there is no documentation of restoration methods or successes in many other parts of the tropics. However, in situations where degradation does not involve drainage, ecological restoration may be possible. In South America, for example, there is growing interest in restoration of palm swamps, and as experiences are gained it will be important to document success factors to inform successive efforts (Virapongse et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="267.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 267.58; y1: 277.08; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="267.58" x1="307.6">In higher latitudes where degraded peatlands have been drained, the most effective option to reduce losses from these large organic carbon stocks is to change hydrological conditions and increase soil moisture and surface wetness (Regina et al. 2015). Long-term GHG monitoring in boreal sites has demonstrated that rewetting and restoration noticeably reduce emissions compared to degraded drained sites and can restore the carbon sink function when vegetation is re-established (Wilson et al. 2016; IPCC 2014a; Nugent et al. 2018) although, restored ecosystems may not yet be as resilient as their undisturbed counterparts (Wilson et al. 2016). Several studies have demonstrated the co-bene&#64257;ts of rewetting speci&#64257;c degraded peatlands for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, (Parry et al. 2014; Ramchunder et al. 2012; Renou-Wilson et al. 2018) and other ecosystem services, such as improvement of water storage and quality (Martin-Ortega et al. 2014) with bene&#64257;cial consequences for human well-being (Bonn et al. 2016; Parry et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="391.84" top="735.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 735.42; y1: 745.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="735.42" x1="391.84">1.9.5 Biochar </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="711.52" x1="566.12">Biochar is organic matter that is carbonised by heating in an oxygen-limited environment, and used as a&#160;soil amendment.
