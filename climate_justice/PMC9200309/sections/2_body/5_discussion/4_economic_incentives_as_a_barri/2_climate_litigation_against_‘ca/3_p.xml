<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In <italic toggle="yes">City and County of Honolulu v Sunoco oil</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], the claim is that not only have &#8220;Native Hawaiian cultural sites, built structures, natural resources, and infrastructure including roads, sewerage, and beach parks, and other resources been more frequently flooded and, in some cases, inundated&#8221;, but oil companies knew the climate science, and impending harm to public health since the 1950&#8217;s. The state is thus seeking financial compensation for losses, which illustrates how the courts are asked to price the impacts of climate change.</p>
