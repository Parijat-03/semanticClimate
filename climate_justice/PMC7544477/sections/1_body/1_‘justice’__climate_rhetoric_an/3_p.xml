political and judicial institutions in Canada have robust records of legitimising and protecting fossil fuel projects that are heavily opposed. Regimes for &#8216;recognizing&#8217; the rights of Indigenous people are circumscribed by entrenched forms of settler-colonialism that perpetuate institutional racism, ongoing dispossession and narrow visions of environmental justice that tend to keep extractive interests prioritised (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">McCreary &amp; Milligan, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Preston, 2017</xref>). Alberta's Premier has celebrated and championed aggressive tough punishment for those who seek to oppose and disrupt oil development, arguing that Canada should find Russian President Vladimir Putin's approach to crackdowns &#8220;very instructive&#8221; (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">PressProgress, 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, while subsidies for oil interests persist, legal &#8216;injunctions&#8217;&#8211; tools courts use to stop what they label as &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; &#8211; have been used widely by corporations against Indigenous groups. A study released in 2019 by scholars at Yellowhead Institute gives ground-breaking analysis of how skewed injunctions are as legal tools in Canada, enabling fossil fuel projects and systemic bias in determining who can block whom from land; it found corporations succeeded in 76 per cent of injunctions filed against First Nations, while First Nations were denied in 81 per cent of injunctions against corporations (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Pasternak &amp; King, 2019</xref>, p. 68).</p>
