Trade affects emissions through its influence on consumption and investment patterns, relocation of production (often to LMICs) and international transport but also on transfer of technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. China ranks as the highest global contributor to pollution by total emissions per annum, however as a net exporter of emissions, a large amount of China&#8217;s emissions is embedded in produced goods exported and consumed by developed countries such as the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
