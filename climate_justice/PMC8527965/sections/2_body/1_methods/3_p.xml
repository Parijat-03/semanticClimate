There were slightly more male than female participants, with the youngest participant being 19, oldest being 63 and mean age of participants being 42.6. Fiji was the most common country of origin and residence for respondents, followed by the Cook Islands and Australia. There was representation of participants (as country of origin) from Fiji, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Vanuatu, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, American Samoa and New Caledonia, however, several other Pacific Island countries were not represented by participants in this study, which remains a limitation. The questions and methods for this study were also designed to ascertain the views of professional &#8216;expert&#8217; groups rather than laypeople&#8217;s views, primarily due to fieldwork restrictions due to COVID-19. A future study on laypeople&#8217;s views will be critical for further building upon, unpacking and refining the findings of this paper.</p>
