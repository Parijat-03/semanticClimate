<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Regarding our strengths and limitations, this is the first study in Chile that seeks to find an association between COVID-19 and long-term exposure to pollution, while adjusting for potential social and climatic confounders. Even when several confounders were included, residual confounding was possible. Likewise, the data on climatic parameters correspond to the 30-year average and likely differ from the specific conditions observed during 2020. Like all ecological studies, these results do not establish relationships at the individual level. Chile has 346 communes, and our analyses were based on 188; if we had data regarding air pollutants for the total number of communes, perhaps we could have reduced random error and the potential selection bias and achieved better statistical power.</p>
