SHPs are poorly understood, especially since the impacts of clusters of small dams are just becoming evident (Mantel et al. 2010; Fencl et al. 2015; Kibler and Tullos 2013). SHPs (&lt;25/30 MW) are labelled &#8216;green&#8217; and are often exempt from environmental scrutiny (Abbasi and Abbasi 2011; Pinho et al. 2007; Premalatha et al. 2014b; Era Consultancy 2006). Being promoted in mountainous global biodiversity hotspots, SHPs have changed the hydrology, water quality and ecology of headwater streams and neighbouring forests signi&#64257;cantly. SHPs have created dewatered stretches of stream immediately downstream and introduced sub-daily to sub-weekly hydro-pulses that have transformed the natural dry-season &#64258;ow regime. Hydrologic and ecological connectivity have been impacted, especially for endemic &#64257;sh communities and forests in some sites of signi&#64257;cant biodiversity values (</span><span style="x0: 385.42; x1: 392.28; y0: 531.54; y1: 541.04; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="385.42" y0="531.54" x1="522.32">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 522.32; x1: 524.96; y0: 531.54; y1: 541.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="522.32" y0="531.54" x1="557.6">) (Jumani et al. 2017, 2018; Chhatre and Lakhanpal 2018; Anderson et al. 2006; Grumbine and Pandit 2013).

Bhosale 2018). The loss of habitat for these species over the decades has been largely due to agricultural intensi&#64257;cation driven by irrigation and bad management in designated reserves (Collar et al. 2015; Ledec, George C.; Rapp, Kennan W.; Aiello 2011) but intrusion of power lines is a major worry for highly endangered species such as the Great Indian Bustard (Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and conservation and mitigation efforts are being planned to address such concerns (Government of India 2012).

India&#8217;s National Waterways seeks to cut transportation time and costs and reduce carbon emissions from road transport (Admin 2017). There is some evidence that dredging and under-water noise could impact the water quality, human health and habitat of &#64257;sh species (Junior et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2012), disrupt artisanal &#64257;sheries and potentially impact species that rely on echo-location (</span><span style="x0: 430.38; x1: 432.49; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="430.38" y0="315.57" x1="552.68">low evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 552.68; x1: 555.32; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="552.68" y0="315.57" x1="557.6">) (Dey&#160;Mayukh 2018).

These include mandatory environmental impact assessments, conserving remaining undammed headwater streams in regulated basins, maintaining adequate environmental &#64258;ows, and implementing other adaptation measures based on experiments with active management of &#64257;sh communities in impacted zones (Jumani et al. 2018). Location of large solar farms needs to be carefully scrutinised (Sindhu et al. 2017). For mitigating negative impacts of power lines associated with solar and wind farms in bustard habitats, suggested measures include diversion structures to prevent collision, underground cables and avoidance in core wildlife habitat, as well as incentives for maintaining low-intensity rainfed agriculture and pasture around existing reserves, and curtailing harmful infrastructure in priority areas (Collar et al. 2015). Mitigation for minimising the ecological impact of inland waterways on biodiversity and &#64257;sheries is more complicated, but may involve improved boat technology to reduce underwater noise, maintaining ecological &#64258;ows and thus reduced dredging, and avoidance in key habitats (Dey&#160;Mayukh&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="555.25" top="123.59"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 123.59; y1: 133.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="123.59" x1="555.25">The management of ecological trade-offs of green energy and green infrastructure and transportation projects may be crucial for&#160;long- term sustainability and acceptance of emerging low-carbon economies.</span></div></body></html>
