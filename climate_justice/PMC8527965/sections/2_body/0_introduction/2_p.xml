(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) illustrated one thousand ways to experience loss from over 100 case studies from around the world. It showcased &#8220;numerous lived experiences with climate-related harm&#8221;, such as losses to culture and traditions, physical and mental health, sense of place and social fabric as well as identity and dignity, among others (Tschakert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>, p. 69). McNamara et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021a</xref>) conducted a systematic review to understand what was already known about non-economic loss and damage (NELD) (i.e. those irreducible to economic terms) in the Pacific Islands region and concluded that: &#8220;[n]on-economic loss and damage induced by climate change in the Pacific Islands region has been reported as fears of cultural loss, deterioration of vital ecosystem services, and dislocation from ancestral lands, among others&#8221;. NELD is a critical area of focus, as loss and damage research and practice has tended to prioritise identifying and addressing economic losses and damages that are easier to quantify and monetise (McNamara and Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). There are, therefore, still limited in-depth understandings of NELD and how they can be addressed, rebuilt and worked through, which can discount certain experiences and distort or skew constructions of climate change and associated decision-making (Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2016</xref>; McShane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2017</xref>; Thomas and Benjamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2020</xref>).</p>
