<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The year 2020 saw the confluence of two major crises, that is, the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and the extensive, severe wildfires in August&#8211;September, impacting people's health and wellbeing in western and central United States. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), commonly known as COVID&#8208;19, was initially detected in Wuhan, China, and has widely spread across the globe (Zhu et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, due to its rapid and hazardous spread and the need for a coordinated response among countries worldwide (World Health Organization,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the United States (US), there were about 20 million confirmed cases and 344,227 deaths as of December 31, 2020. Given that there was no effective vaccines and treatment available for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, non&#8208;pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been used as the key weapon against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Multiple NPI strategies and policies have been conducted across the US since February 2, 2020 (NAFSA,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), including travel bans, lockdowns, school/business closures, movement restrictions, and social distancing policies (Perra,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>
