Much of this knowledge, produced and evaluated through decision support interfaces steeped in GIS-based climate impact visualization platforms and policy simulation models, digitize the governance of nature and create a &#8220;digital environmental politics,&#8221; wielded and managed through mathematical algorithms (Machen and Nost, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2021</xref>). Such processes echo the fears of &#8220;objective&#8221; science in a &#8220;post-truth&#8221; era. They depend on scientific algorithms as respected arbitrators of credibility but end up marginalizing the multiplicity of climate knowledges while neglecting critical issues of responsibility and accountability in the science-policy debate.</p>
