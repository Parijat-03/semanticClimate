It was unsuccessful in setting a concrete pathway to deliver the promise of a clean energy transition by 2030 and achieving SDG 7, which calls for &#8216;ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all&#8217;. Although it acknowledges the need for financial flows to the countries that need to adapt to climate change, it fails to mention any concrete commitments. The reality is that if the 2030 goals are to be met, investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency need to be tripled. Mobilizing adequate and predictable finance, shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, and putting a price on carbon are all crucial in accelerating the energy transition and will need to be addressed at the next COP. A number of concrete steps, including funds mobilization, addressinbg the digital divide, harnessing innovation, technology, and data collection and application are still to be taken. The skills necessary to push energy transition forward are still not readily available for young women and men in the developing world. This gap is contributing to a mismatch in the job market and lost potential for economic growth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref></p>
