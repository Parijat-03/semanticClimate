Analysis of historical cumulative emissions by Teng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>) shows that 70% of &#8216;carbon space&#8217; in the atmosphere has been unequally distributed. The remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5&#160;&#176;C relative to pre-industrial levels is approximately 400 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, rising to 1150 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for 2&#160;&#176;C (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2021</xref>). The paper by Alcaraz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>) presents a model for distributing this global carbon budget using climate justice criteria. Applying a Model of Climate Justice per capita (MCJ), countries with large populations and low levels of historical emissions, including for example India, Brazil, Other Latin American and Caribbean (OLAC) countries and Other African (OA) countries would benefit from higher carbon budgets reflective of their low historical emissions. In contrast, countries with historical emission levels above the world average, including for example the EU27 and the USA would be allocated considerably reduced carbon budgets. Applying Alcaraz et al.&#8217;s MCJ model to the UNEP headline figure of 1150 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for 2&#160;&#176;C of warming, carbon budget emissions figures by 2100 include: EU27-63GT, USA-31GT, India-220GT, Brazil-33GT, Other African-219GT. Such budgets would require an extraordinary mobilisation of resources in the advanced economies, for which there is little evidence to date.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref></p>
