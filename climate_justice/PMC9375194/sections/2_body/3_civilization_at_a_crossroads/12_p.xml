Their decisions will almost inevitably make the nation more divided, with those worst off relegated to a nightmare future in which they are left to fend for themselves. Nor will these disruptions wait for the worst environmental changes to occur. The wave begins when individual perception of risk starts to shift, when the environmental threat reaches past the least fortunate and rattles the physical and financial security of broader, wealthier parts of the population. It begins when even places like California&#8217;s suburbs are no longer safe. It has already begun. (Lustgarten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
