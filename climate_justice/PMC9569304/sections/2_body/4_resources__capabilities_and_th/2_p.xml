Each person would be given a fair allocation of nonrenewable resources, access to water, and rights to emit greenhouse gasses. Each person could choose what to do with their resources&#8212;they could consume them or pass them on to the children they would have. All preferences would be treated equally: no distinction would be made between preferences for valuable capabilities, preferences for idiosyncrasies, or excessive amounts of consumption that do not increase valuable capabilities. Given the significant impact on the ecosystem that procreative parenting has, resource egalitarianism in practice implies that parents would only be able to enjoy a fraction of the emissions-weighted consumption of nonparents, since parents would need to allocate part of their emissions entitlement to their children.</p>
