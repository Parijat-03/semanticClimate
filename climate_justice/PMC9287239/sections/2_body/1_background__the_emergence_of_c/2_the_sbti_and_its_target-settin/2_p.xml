<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par9">SBTi currently recommends two target-setting methods, which are integrated in the organization&#8217;s target calculation tool, for scope 1 and 2 emissions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The absolute contraction approach (ACA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] implies that all companies reduce absolute emissions by the same proportion. The sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] assumes that some sectors, based on the cost of mitigation, will reduce emissions faster than others while factoring in company-specific base year emission intensity and growth projections. While SBTi once allowed scope 1 and 2 SBTs to align with a 2&#160;&#176;C temperature goal, companies must now set SBTs aligned with a well-below 2&#160;&#176;C scenario or a more ambitious 1.5&#160;&#176;C scenario. Whereas ACA is broadly applicable, SDA is applicable to a handful of &#8220;homogenous&#8221; sectors and can currently only calculate SBTs aligned with 1.5&#160;&#176;C for the power sector.</p>
