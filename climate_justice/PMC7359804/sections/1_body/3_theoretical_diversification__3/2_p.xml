<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0120">Enright's conception of transit justice edges towards <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Sheller, 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Sheller, 2018b</xref> multi-scalar concept of mobility justice introduced earlier. Both direct attention towards the ways in which power and inequality shape people's movements, motility and immobility, as well as the attempts of states and other actors to govern and control mobility. At the same time, Sheller's more expansive conceptualisation covers a wider range of spatial scales and pays greater attention to the circulation of goods, resources and information. This reflects the grounding of Sheller's conceptualisation in a mobile ontology with three key attributes. She holds, firstly, that spatial and temporal scales are entangled, and secondly that movements, meanings, and values co-evolve with each other and in close connection with difference, subject formation, and embodiment. She finally proposes that transport, environmental, and climate justice are inevitably entwined and co-constituted. In this, she calls for a process of commoning of mobility (see also <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Nikolaeva et al., 2019</xref>) with a view to shifting mobility away from individualised and privatised ownership, as well as from borders and from capitalism. Hers and <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Nikolaeva et al.'s (2019)</xref> are proactive proposals to reconstitute new mobility systems and practices in which the co-produced and cooperative nature of mobility is recognised and nurtured as key to achieving mobility justice.</p>
