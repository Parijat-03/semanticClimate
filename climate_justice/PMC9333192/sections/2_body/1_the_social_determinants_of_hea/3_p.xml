<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A health system that is capable of developing reflective practices that can link diagnoses and contexts more concretely with feasible prescriptions for improving health, will require health workers to adapt their understanding of new knowledge. For instance, they will need to understand the impacts of over-reliance on non-renewable energy resources and the ways in which health equity and planetary health considerations are interlinked. The lack of understanding of these issues has helped create the ideal conditions for the current non-communicable diseases (NCDs) global epidemic. The NCDs themselves are not rooted primarily in individual choices but rather, in the way we plan our cities, promote huge agribusinesses rather than small-scale farmers and encourage the promotion of ultra-processed foods rather than healthy traditional options. Structural determinants behind these factors include weak investments in public education, infrastructure and services, unaccountable market mechanisms with unfair labour practices and promotion of consumerism values at the expense of population health and climate. The health sector can play a major role by promoting action on social determinants of health to enable patients and communities to have the resources and environments to enable healthier behaviours (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Paremoer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
