This process has been applied in relation to coastal sea level rise, starting with low-risk, low-cost measures and working up to measures requiring greater investment after review and reevaluation (Barnett et al. 2014). A &#64257;rst measure was stringent controls of new development, graduating to managed relocation of low-lying critical infrastructure, and eventually movement of habitable dwellings to more elevated parts of town, as &#64258;ooding and inundation triggers are experienced (Haasnoot et al. 2018; Lawrence et al. 2018; Barnett et al. 2014; Stephens et al. 2018). Nanda et al. (2018) apply the concept to a wetland in Australia to identify a mix of short- and long-term decisions, and Prober et al. (2017) develop adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes, also in Australia. Both studies identify that longer-term decisions may involve a&#160;considerable change to institutional arrangements at different scales. Viewing climate mitigation as a series of connected decisions over a long time period and not an isolated decision, reduces the fragmentation and uncertainty endemic of models and effectiveness of policy measures (Roelich and Giesekam 2019).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="96.68" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.56" x1="96.68">There is </span><span style="x0: 98.95; x1: 105.81; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="98.95" y0="447.56" x1="165.3">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 167.57; x1: 171.97; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="167.57" y0="447.56" x1="183.11">and </span><span style="x0: 185.38; x1: 189.96; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="185.38" y0="447.56" x1="245.5">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 247.77; x1: 250.58; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="247.77" y0="447.56" x1="313.22">that participatory processes in adaptive governance within and across policy regimes overcome limitations of polycentric governance, allowing priorities to be set in sustainable development through rural land management and integrated water resource management (Rouillard et al. 2013). Adaptive governance addresses large uncertainties and their social ampli&#64257;cation through differing perceptions of risk (Kasperson 2012; Fra.Paleo 2015) offering an approach to co-evolve with risk by implementing policy mixes and assessing effectiveness in an ongoing process, making mid-point corrections when necessary (Fra.Paleo 2015).

In Alaska, adaptive governance responded to the dynamic risk of extreme weather events and issue of climate migration by providing a continuum of policy from protection in place to community relocation, integrating across levels and actors in a more effective and less costly response option than other governance systems (Bronen and Chapin 2013). In comparison to other governance initiatives of ecosystem management aimed at conservation and sustainable use of natural capital, adaptive governance has visible effects on natural capital by monitoring, communicating and responding to ecosystem-wide changes at the landscape level (Schultz et al. 2015). Adaptive governance can be applied to manage drought assistance as a common property resource. Adaptive governance can manage complex, interacting goals to create innovative policy options, facilitated through nested and polycentric systems of governance, effected by watershed or catchment management groups in areas of natural resource management (Nelson et al. 2008).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="353.44" top="519.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 519.6; y1: 529.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="519.6" x1="353.44">There is </span><span style="x0: 353.28; x1: 360.14; y0: 519.6; y1: 529.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="353.28" y0="519.6" x1="418.52">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 418.36; x1: 422.76; y0: 519.6; y1: 529.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="418.36" y0="519.6" x1="434.19">and </span><span style="x0: 434.03; x1: 438.6; y0: 519.6; y1: 529.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="434.03" y0="519.6" x1="492.94">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 492.78; x1: 495.6; y0: 519.6; y1: 529.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="492.78" y0="519.6" x1="571.78">that transformational change is a necessary societal response option to manage climate risks which is uniquely characterised by the depth of change needed to reframe problems and change dominant mindsets, the scope of change needed (that is larger than just a few people) and the speed of change required to reduce emissions (O&#8217;Brien et al. 2012; Termeer et al. 2017). Transformation of governance occurs with changes in values to re&#64258;ect an understanding that the environmental crisis occurs in the context of our relation with the earth (Hordijk et al. 2014; Pelling 2010). Transformation can happen by intervention strategies that enable small in-depth wins, amplify these small wins through integration into existing practices, and unblock stagnations (locked in structures) preventing transformation by confronting social and cognitive &#64257;xations with counterintuitive interventions (Termeer et al. 2017). Iterative consideration of issues and reformulation of policy instruments and response options facilitates transformation by allowing experimentation (Monkelbaan 2019).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="515.1" top="267.01"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.04; y0: 267.01; y1: 279.01; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="267.01" x1="515.1">Box&#160;7.2 |  Adaptive governance and interlinkages of food, &#64257;bre, water, energy and land</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.53" top="243.52"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.77; y0: 243.52; y1: 253.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="243.52" x1="557.53">Emerging literature and case studies recognise the connectedness of the environment and human activities, and the interrelationships of multiple resource-use practices in an attempt to understand synergies and trade-offs (Albrecht et al. 2018).
