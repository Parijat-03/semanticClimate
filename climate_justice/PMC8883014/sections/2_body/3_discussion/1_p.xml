While both the CCA functional impairment and cognitive emotional impairment subscales were significantly associated with GAD symptoms, only CCA functional impairment was associated with higher MDD symptoms. Climate&#160;activism moderated the association between CCA cognitive emotional impairment and MDD symptoms, with a significant association between CCA and MDD emerging for those with low levels of activism, but no significant association for those with high levels of activism. Additionally, engagement in individual action was significantly associated with lower levels of GAD symptoms, but no moderation effects were detected for individual action. Qualitative data provided a deeper understanding of emerging adults&#8217; worries and actions, indicating the severity of worries related to climate change among the majority of&#160;participants but particularly striking among those with higher levels of CCA and mental health distress.</p>
