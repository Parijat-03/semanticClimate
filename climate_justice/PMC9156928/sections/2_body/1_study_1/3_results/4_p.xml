<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For <bold>H2</bold>, our prediction was that each behavioural outcome would increase from baseline to follow-up: (a) climate activism events attended (objective), (b) environmental education and leadership behaviours (self-report) and (c) emissions-reduction behaviours (self-report). However, there was scarcely any change in behavioural outcomes. For objective attendance of activism events, only two participants joined during the intervention (one participant joined five events, and the other participant joined one event); self-reported environmental education and leadership had no change (&#8722;0.02 out of 7), and self-reported emissions reduction also had no change (+0.01 out of 7, all <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>s (95) &lt; 1.00, all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>s &gt; 0.99 all <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>s &lt; 0.10).</p>
