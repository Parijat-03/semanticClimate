Yet, this measure does not cover the full gamut of climate-related challenges that tribes might face. Specifically, these declarations do not cover drought. The reason is bureaucratic: funding to address drought comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Thus, we include the average consecutive weeks of drought per year at levels that impose mandatory water use restrictions from 1980 to 2019. Data are reported in the EPA Climate Indicators study and gathered from the U.S. Drought Monitor. As the indicators frequently do not cover tribal areas, we used data for the nearest county. We ran a model that included drought and found the key results unchanged (Model 3). <xref rid="pone.0261752.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the key results from our robustness checks.</p>
