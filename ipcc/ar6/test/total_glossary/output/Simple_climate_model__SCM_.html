<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A broad class of lower-dimensional models of the <em>energy balance</em>, radiative transfer, <em>carbon cycle,</em> or a combination of such physical components. SCMs are also suitable for performing <em>emulations</em> of climate-mean variables of <em>Earth system models (ESMs)</em>, given that their structural flexibility can capture both the parametric and structural uncertainties across process-oriented ESM responses. They can also be used to test consistency across multiple lines of evidence with regard to <em>climate sensitivity</em> ranges, <em>transient climate responses (TCRs)</em>, <em>transient climate response to cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (TCREs)</em> and carbon cycle <em>feedbacks</em>.</p></dd>
