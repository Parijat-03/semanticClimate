For instance, at its peak of cases, Imperial County, California, an agricultural community on the border of Mexico and Arizona, had the highest per capita rate of cases in the entire state (Bottemiller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). The farmworkers there faced a dystopian reality in which smoke from climate-change-fueled wildfires and a respiratory pandemic inhibited their ability to breathe. This isn&#8217;t even mentioning the constant fear these farmworkers, many undocumented, live with due to our militarized and brutal immigration system. Such intersections&#8212;between the climate, coronavirus, Indigenous, criminal and immigrant justice&#8212;show why climate change cannot be separated from the other injustices affecting our world.</p>
