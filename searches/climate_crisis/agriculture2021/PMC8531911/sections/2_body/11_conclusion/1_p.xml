Even as the WEF claims multilateralism is dead, leaving a vacuum to be filled by corporate infrastructure and know-how, this is likely to be a short-term private &#8216;solution,&#8217; lacking substantive public stability. As Giovanni Arrighi noted with respect to such conjunctural quandaries: &#8216;A dominant state exercises a hegemonic function if it leads the system of states in a desired direction and, in so doing, is perceived as pursuing a universal interest. It is this kind of leadership that makes the dominant state hegemonic. <italic>But a dominant state may lead also in the sense that it draws other states into its path of development&#8217;</italic> (Arrighi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1990</xref>: 367, emphasis added). China could be that dominant state as this century unfolds, with public health and planetary well-being facing staggering challenges.</p>
