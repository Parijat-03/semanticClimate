Integrated assessment modeling illustrates that better use of food, particularly through reduction of food wastage and losses, would allow a significant part of food access issues to be reduced. Better food access should also improve the redistribution of food within society, as access to food remains deeply uneven, mostly for reasons of economic inequality (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
