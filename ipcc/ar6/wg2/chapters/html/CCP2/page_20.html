Coastal C&amp;S range from small settlements along waterways and estuaries, to small island states with maritime populations and/or beaches and atolls that are major tourist attractions, large cities that are major transport and financial hubs in coastal deltas, to megacities and even megaregions with several coastal megacities.</span></div><div left="60.94" right="543.05" top="439.07"><span x0="60.94" y0="439.07" x1="543.05" style="x0: 60.94; x1: 65.95; y0: 439.07; y1: 448.07; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The concentration of people, economic activity and infrastructure dynamically interacts with coast-specific hazards to magnify the exposure of these C&amp;S to climate risks. While large inland cities and coastal settlements can be exposed to climate-driven hazards, such as urban heat islands and air pollution, the latter are also subject to distinctive ocean-driven hazards, such as sea level rise (SLR), exposure to tropical cyclones and storm surges, flooding from extreme tides and land subsidence from decreased sediment deposition along coastal deltas and estuaries. With climate change increasing, the intensity and frequency of hazards under all future warming levels and thus the risks to lives, livelihoods and property are especially acute in C&amp;S by the sea.</span></div><div left="60.94" right="543.08" top="349.09"><span x0="60.94" y0="349.09" x1="543.08" style="x0: 60.94; x1: 66.44; y0: 349.09; y1: 358.09; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Coastal cities are diverse in shape, size, growth patterns and trajectories, and in terms of access to cultural, financial and ecosystem resources and services. Along deltaic and estuarine archetypes, cities most vulnerable to a changing climate have relatively high levels of poverty and inequality in terms of access to resources and ecosystem services, with large populations and dense built environments translating into higher exposure to coastal climate risks.</span></div><div left="60.94" right="543.12" top="295.1"><span x0="60.94" y0="295.1" x1="543.12" style="x0: 60.94; x1: 65.95; y0: 295.1; y1: 304.1; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">These climate risks at the coast can also be magnified by compounding and cascading effects due to non-climate drivers directly affecting vulnerable peri- and ex-urban areas inland. These risks include disruption to transport supply chains and energy infrastructure from airports and power plants sited along the coastline, as occurred in New York City, USA, during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The impacts can be felt around the world through globalised economic and geopolitical linkages, for example through maritime trade and port linkages.</span></div><div left="60.94" right="543.07" top="229.11"><span x0="60.94" y0="229.11" x1="543.07" style="x0: 60.94; x1: 65.44; y0: 229.11; y1: 238.11; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">For open coasts, settlements on low-lying small island states and the Arctic are especially vulnerable to climate change, and SLR impacts in particular, well before 2100. While the economic risks may not compare to the scale of those faced in coastal megacities with high per capita GDP, the existential risks to some nations and an array of distinctive livelihoods, cultural heritage and ways of life in these settlements are great, even with modest SLR.</span></div></body></html>
