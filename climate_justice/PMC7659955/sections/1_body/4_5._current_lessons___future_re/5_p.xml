<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As a result of some of the aforementioned challenges of CSA, future studies might look at the challenges posed by the adoption of &#8220;climate-smart&#8221; agriculture, prior to the full adoption of its fundamental aspects, as described in this study. This is because research by Taylor [<xref rid="B86-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] pointed out certain foundation faults in the description of CSA by the World Bank group. There is also a fundamental problem in how CSA handles climate justice [<xref rid="B87-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Another aspect opened to future research is the development of the climate-smart villages, as used in some studies [<xref rid="B69-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. While this has been achieved in some parts of the world today [<xref rid="B13-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it might be the case that smart-village research is yet to reach a maturity level as to warrant even more terms to be coined from it. </p>
