First, one can understand ceilings as limitations on use of luxury items (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 417). That they are <italic>luxury</italic> items means that they are contributing to capabilities that are already well above the threshold that justice requires securing for each person. Forfeiting them, or taxing them or limiting their use, would not entail a morally relevant sacrifice if it does not push the agent utilising them below the threshold. This is similar to Henry Shue&#8217;s distinction between luxury and subsistence emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]), while luxury emissions are not morally relevant subsistence emissions are. Yet, he leaves it quite open as to where the difference is (Shue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref> [1993]: 66). The CA applied to energy is instructive given that it establishes what energy availability should enable. Second, celings would, as suggested above, divert resources that could go to more fundamental capability protections (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 417).</p>
