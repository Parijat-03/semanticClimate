      <td>Global land monsoon precipitation decreased from the 1950s to the 1980s, partly due to anthropogenic aerosols, but\nhas increased since then in response to GHG forcing and large-scale multi-decadal variability (medium confidence).\nNorthern Hemispheric anthropogenic aerosols weakened the regional monsoon circulations in South Asia, East Asia\nand West Africa during the second half of the 20th century, thereby offsetting the expected strengthening of monsoon\nprecipitation in response to GHG-induced warming (high confidence).\nDuring the 21st century, global land monsoon precipitation is projected to increase in response to GHG warming in\nall time horizons and scenarios (high confidence). Over South and South East Asia, East Asia and the central Sahel,\nmonsoon precipitation is projected to increase, whereas over North America and the far western Sahel it is projected\nto decrease (medium confidence). There is low confidence in projected precipitation changes in the South American\nand Australian-Maritime Continent monsoons. At global and regional scales, near-term monsoon changes will be\ndominated by the effects of internal variability (medium confidence). {2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 3.3, 4.4, 4.5, 8.2,\n8.3, 8.4, 8.5, Box 8.1, Box 8.2, 10.6}</td>

      <td>(medium confidence). In the instrumental records, global summer monsoon precipitation intensity has likely increased since the\n1980s, dominated by Northern Hemisphere summer trends and large multi-decadal variability. Contrary to the expected increase of\nprecipitation under global warming, the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions experienced declining precipitation from the 1950s\nto 1980s, which is partly attributable to the influence of anthropogenic aerosols (medium confidence) (Box TS.13, Figure 1). {2.3.1,\nCross-Chapter Box 2.4, 3.3.2, 3.3.3}</td>

      <td>With continued global warming, it is likely that global land monsoon precipitation will increase during this century (Box TS.13, Figure 1),\nparticularly in the Northern Hemisphere, although the monsoon circulation is projected to weaken. A slowdown of the tropical circulation\nwith global warming can partly offset the warming-induced strengthening of precipitation in monsoon regions (high confidence). In the\nnear term, global monsoon changes are likely to be dominated by the effects of internal variability and model uncertainties (medium\nconfidence). In the long term, global monsoon rainfall change will feature a robust north&#8211;south asymmetry characterized by a greater\nincrease in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere and an east&#8211;west asymmetry characterized by enhanced Asian&#8211;\nAfrican monsoons and a weakened North American monsoon (medium confidence). {4.4.1, 4.5.1, 8.4.1}</td>
