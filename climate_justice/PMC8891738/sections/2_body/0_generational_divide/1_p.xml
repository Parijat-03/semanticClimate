In his opening remarks, he called on world leaders to bridge the divide among generations. He continued that the past generations failed to respond adequatly to many of the global challenges we are facing today. Young women and men, however, are taking the steering wheel in an effort to make a real change in the fight for human rights and dignity for all, gender equality and climate action. Guterres underlined the need to harness young people&#8217;s talent, energy, and ideas and expand opportunities for today&#8217;s and future generations. Support is not enough; they need a seat at the table.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> The SG could sense a growing gap in how we see the world and how we want to work for our shared future.</p>
