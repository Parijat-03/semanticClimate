<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0355">The transformation of food and land-use systems has a central role to play in reaching the SDGs and meeting other key international policy objectives, such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (<xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015b</xref>). Changes in land use practices and dietary shifts are needed to improve food security and human health, meet environmental objectives, and strengthen the resilience of livelihoods and economic sectors. The impacts of COVID-19, explored in Section 3, further reinforce the need for transformation of food systems. The pandemic cannot be used as an argument for delaying action, as the key sustainable development challenges remain and are fundamental to long-term human well-being. Instead, the COVID-19 crisis calls for a recovery that is fully embedded in the ambition of the SDGs (see <xref rid="bb0570" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2015a</xref>).</p>
