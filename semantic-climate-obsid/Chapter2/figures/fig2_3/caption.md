![[fig2_3.png]]Figure 2.3 Comparison between top-down estimates and bottom-up EDGAR inventory data on GHG emissions for 1980-2016 

Left panel: Total GWP-100-weighted emissions based on IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021a) of F-gases in Olivier & Peters (2020) [EDGARv5FT] (red dashed line, excluding C4F10, C5F12, C6F14 and C7F16) and EDGARv6 (purple dashed line) compared to top-down estimates based on AGAGE and NOAA data from WMO (2018) (blue lines; Engel and Rigby (2018); Montzka and Velders (2018)). 

Right panel: Top-down aggregated emissions for the three most abundant CFCs (-11, -12 and -113) and HCFCs (-22, -141b, -12 142b) not covered in bottom-up emissions inventories are shown in green and orange. For top-down estimates the shaded areas between two respective lines represent 1Ïƒ uncertainties.
