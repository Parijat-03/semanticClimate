The recent proliferation of national mid-century net zero GHG targets can be attributed in part to the Paris Agreement. Moreover, its processes and commitments will enhance countries&#8217; abilities to achieve their stated level of ambition, particularly among developing countries. Arguments against the Paris Agreement are that it lacks a&#160;mechanism to review the adequacy of individual Parties&#8217; Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that collectively current NDCs are inconsistent in their level of ambition with achieving the Paris Agreement&#8217;s long-term temperature goal, that its processes will not lead to sufficiently rising levels of ambition in the NDCs, and that NDCs will not be achieved because the targets, policies and measures they contain are not legally binding at the international level. To some extent, arguments on both sides are aligned with different analytic frameworks, including assumptions about the main barriers to mitigation that international cooperation can help overcome. The extent to which countries increase the ambition of their NDCs and ensure they are effectively implemented will depend in part on the successful implementation of the support mechanisms in the Paris Agreement, and in turn will determine whether the goals of the Paris&#160;Agreement are met (</span><span style="x0: 402.72; x1: 407.3; y0: 462.7; y1: 472.2; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="402.72" y0="462.7" x1="459.72">high confidence</span><span x0="459.72" y0="462.7" x1="530.43" style="x0: 459.72; x1: 462.36; y0: 462.7; y1: 472.2; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). {14.2, 14.3, 14.4} </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.79" top="438.71"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 312.19; y0: 438.71; y1: 448.21; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.55" y0="438.71" x1="557.79">International cooperation outside the UNFCCC processes and agreements provides critical support for mitigation in particular regions, sectors and industries, for particular types of emissions, and at the sub- and trans-national levels (</span><span style="x0: 537.87; x1: 542.8; y0: 402.71; y1: 412.21; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCnIta;" x0="537.87" y0="402.71" x1="557.77">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 352.66; x1: 355.47; y0: 390.71; y1: 400.21; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="352.66" y0="390.71" x1="360.06">). </span><span x0="358.91" y0="390.71" x1="557.6" style="x0: 358.91; x1: 364.36; y0: 390.71; y1: 400.21; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Agreements addressing ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution, and release of mercury are all leading to reductions in the emissions of specific greenhouse gases.
