It is up to international organizations, governments, and the private sector to realize this and provide them with the support and spotlight they deserve. The shift from looking at youth as beneficiaries to youth as innovators and creators is yet to happen in many places, both in the public and private spheres. There are some compelling examples, however, emerging. The Youth Sustainable Energy Hub is one of these. A team of enthusiastic volunteers showcases how young women and men are at the forefront of working toward the achievement of SDG7 in their communities through implementing renewable energy projects. They organize capacity-building workshops and collect lessons learned to inspire youth worldwide. I met Norah Magero, a bright-eyed Kenyan, during her online interview to become a Youth Champion for the Youth for VEF. She was in the field, working on the initiative she co-founded&#8212;Drop Access. This non-profit has redefined off-grid energy access in rural areas, provides financing and trains rural communities in renewable energy technologies. It champions energy for productive uses and cold storage solutions. The latter being a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
