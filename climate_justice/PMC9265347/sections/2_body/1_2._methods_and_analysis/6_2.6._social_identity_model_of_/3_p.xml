<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This recursive model has recently been applied in the context of protests for climate justice [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and it has become a useful framework for explaining social and psychological determinants of climate action (e.g., pro-environmental behaviour directed towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions) [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Applying this model to the PCS would therefore suggest effects on increased intentions to engage in climate action by, inter alia, (1) increasing identification with civil society groups involved in climate action, (2) affecting emotions related to the climate crisis and (3) improving individual and collective efficacy beliefs. </p>
