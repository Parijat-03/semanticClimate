First, that environmental damage is something that is, was or could be included in the market; second, that the solution to market failure is more markets. Such market logic is encapsulated by the infamous memo written by Larry Summers, then chief economist at the World Bank: &#8220;the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that&#8221;. Such a conclusion rests purely on market logic whereby health or the environment can be accurately priced and hence traded: &#8220;The measurements of the costs of health impairing pollution depend on the foregone earnings from increased morbidity and mortality&#8221; (Summers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1991</xref>: unpaginated). If one defines everything else out of the equation then such spurious logic becomes possible; once it is repeated often enough, it becomes the logic of society, as we now see with carbon markets, which are rarely compared with alternatives.</p>
