As a whole, Mediterranean basin countries have a historical responsibility, evaluated as cumulative emissions per capita, similar to the world average. This is the reason why the MCJ allocates in the future for this region, a global emissions percentage similar to the population percentage represented by this region with respect to the world.</p>
