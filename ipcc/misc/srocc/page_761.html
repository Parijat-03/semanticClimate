Social learning is de&#64257;ned as a&#160;change in understanding measured by a change in behaviour, and perhaps worldview, by individuals and wider social units, communities of practice and social networks (Reed et al. 2010; Gupta 2014). Social learning is an important factor contributing to long-term climate adaptation whereby individuals and organisations engage in a multi-step social process, managing different framings of issues while raising awareness of climate and land risks and opportunities, exploring policy options and institutionalising new&#160;rights, responsibilities, feedback and learning processes (T&#224;bara et&#160;al. 2010). It is important for engaging with uncertainty (Newig&#160;et&#160;al. 2010) and addressing the increasing unequal geography of food security (Sonnino et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="435.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 435.56; y1: 445.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="435.56" x1="313.25">Social learning is achieved through re&#64258;exivity or the ability of a social structure, process, or set of ideas to recon&#64257;gure itself after re&#64258;ection on performance through open-minded people interacting iteratively to produce reasonable and well-informed opinions (Dryzek and Pickering 2017). These processes develop through skilled facilitation attending to social differences and power, resulting in a shared view of how change might happen (Harvey et al. 2012; Ensor and Harvey 2015). When combined with collective action, social learning can make transformative change, measured by a change in worldviews (beliefs about the world and reality) and understanding of power dynamics (Gupta 2014; Bamberg et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="154.81" top="279.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 279.42; y1: 289.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="279.42" x1="154.81">7.6.5 Land tenure</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.28" top="255.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.06; y0: 255.52; y1: 265.02; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="255.52" x1="313.28">Land tenure, de&#64257;ned as &#8216;the terms under which land and natural resources are held by individuals, households or social groups&#8217;, is a key dimension in any discussion of land&#8211;climate interactions, including the prospects for both adaptation and land-based mitigation, and possible impacts on tenure and thus land security of both climate change and climate action (Quan and Dyer 2008) (</span><span style="x0: 245.69; x1: 252.55; y0: 195.53; y1: 205.03; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="245.69" y0="195.53" x1="308.68">medium evidence</span><span style="x0: 308.67; x1: 310.95; y0: 195.53; y1: 205.03; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="308.67" y0="195.53" x1="313.23">, </span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.78; y0: 183.54; y1: 193.04; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="65.2" y0="183.54" x1="122.0">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 122.0; x1: 124.64; y0: 183.54; y1: 193.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="122.0" y0="183.54" x1="126.92">).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="159.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 159.54; y1: 169.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="159.54" x1="313.25">Discussion of land tenure in the context of land&#8211;climate interactions in developing countries needs to consider the prevalence of informal, customary and modi&#64257;ed customary systems of land tenure: estimates range widely, but perhaps as much as 65% of the world&#8217;s total land area is managed under some form of these local, customary or communal tenure systems, and only a small fraction of this (around 15%) is formally recognised by governments (Rights and Resources Initiative 2015a).

However, in India approximately 40&#160;million ha of forest land is managed under customary rights not recognised by the government (Rights and Resources Initiative 2015b).

These lands are estimated to hold at least 293 GtC of carbon, of which around one-third (72 GtC) is located in areas where indigenous peoples and local communities lack formal recognition of their tenure rights (Frechette et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="495.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.34; y0: 495.58; y1: 505.08; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="495.58" x1="571.77">Understanding the interactions between land tenure and climate change has to be based on underlying understanding of land tenure and land policy and how they relate to sustainable development, especially in low- and middle-income countries: such understandings have changed considerably over the last three decades, and now show that informal or customary systems can provide secure tenure (Toulmin and Quan 2000). For smallholder systems, Bruce and Migot-Adholla (1994) (among other authors) established that African customary tenure can provide the necessary security for long-term investments in farm fertility such as tree-planting. For pastoral systems, Behnke (1994), Lane and Moorehead (1995) and other authors showed the rationality of communal tenure in situations of environmental variability and herd mobility. However, where customary systems are unrecognised or weakened by governments, or the rights from them are undocumented or unenforced, tenure insecurity may result (Lane 1998; Toulmin and Quan 2000). There is strong empirical evidence of the links between secure communal tenure and lower deforestation rates, particularly for intact forests (Nepstad et al. 2006; Persha et al. 2011; Vergara-Asenjo and Potvin 2014). Securing and recognising tenure for indigenous communities (such as through revisions to legal or policy frameworks) has been shown to be highly cost effective in reducing deforestation and improving land management in certain contexts, and is therefore also apt to help improve indigenous communities&#8217; ability to adapt to climate changes (Suzuki 2012; Balooni et al. 2008; Ceddia et al. 2015; Pacheco et al. 2012; Holland et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="171.62"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.65; y0: 171.62; y1: 181.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="171.62" x1="571.78">Rights to water for agriculture or livestock are linked to land tenure in complex ways still little understood and neglected by policymakers and planners (Cotula 2006a). Provision of water infrastructure tends to increase land values, but irrigation schemes often entail reallocation of land rights (Cotula 2006b) and new inequalities based on water availability such as the creation of a category of tailenders (farmers at the downstream end of distribution channels) in large-scale irrigation (Chambers 1988) and disruption of pastoral grazing patterns through use of riverine land (Behnke and Kerven 2013).</span></div></body></html>
