<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Data were collected in both intervention and control classes one week before and one week after the PCS (<xref rid="ijerph-19-08039-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Students accessed and completed an online survey (Unipark Version 21.2, QuestBack GmbH, Oslo, Norway) at both time points via a link/QR code provided in the invitation leaflet, using their private devices during school hours. A paper-and-pencil version with the same content was also offered. To minimise loss to follow-up, we sent two reminders to encourage participation. Teachers were invited to complete a teacher protocol sheet assessing the number of eligible students and problems during the evaluation process.</p>
