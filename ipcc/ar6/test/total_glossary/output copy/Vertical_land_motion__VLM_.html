<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The change in height of the land surface or the sea floor and can have several causes in addition to elastic deformation associated with contemporary changes in <em>gravity, rotation and viscoelastic solid Earth deformation (GRD)</em> and viscoelastic deformation associated with <em>glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)</em>.</p>
<p>Subsidence (sinking of the land surface or sea floor) can, for instance, occur through compaction of alluvial sediments in deltaic regions, removal of fluids such as gas, oil, and water, or drainage of peatlands. Tectonic deformation of the Earthâs crust can occur as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
