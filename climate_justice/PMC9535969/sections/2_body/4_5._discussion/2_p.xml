<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As we have seen in the literature review, public engagement with geoengineering often elicits four main topics dealing with unfamiliarity, its risky dimension, the moral hazard hypothesis, and a preference for political solutions (<xref rid="bibr7-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Buck, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Corner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Merk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2017</xref>). The first two main themes we have identified are common while debating this topic and they were also shared within Group VI, the &#8216;control group&#8217;. However, the other five themes we identified emphasize the social and political dimensions of geoengineering, and were often framed by resorting to concerns with environmental, climate and intergenerational justice, deep ecology, ecofeminism, North/South imbalances and socioeconomic inequalities. Some of these topics are the flagship concerns of each situated group, indicating that their group identity and situationality mediated the emergence of sociopolitical concerns with geoengineering, entwining these technologies with issues such as global inequalities, extractivist capitalism, climate justice and the Portuguese context.</p>
