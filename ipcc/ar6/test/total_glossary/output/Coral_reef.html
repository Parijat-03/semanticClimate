<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">An underwater <em>ecosystem</em> characterised by structure-building stony corals.</p>
<p>Warm-water coral reefs occur in shallow seas, mostly in the tropics, with the corals (animals) containing algae (plants) that depend on light and relatively stable temperature conditions. Cold-water coral reefs occur throughout the world, mostly at water depths of 50–500 m. In both kinds of reef, living corals frequently grow on older, dead material, predominantly made of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Both warm and cold-water coral reefs support high biodiversity of fish and other groups, and are considered to be especially vulnerable to <em>climate change</em>.</p>
