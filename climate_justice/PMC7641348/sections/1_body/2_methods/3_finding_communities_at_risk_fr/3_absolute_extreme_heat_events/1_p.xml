Previous work has questioned the efficacy of a 105&#176;F heat index threshold for the state of California [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240841.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given that health impacts have been shown to emerge at temperatures as low as 73&#176;F for the coastal region of San Diego County, we used the lower bound of the heat index &#8220;extreme caution&#8221; classification, 91&#176;F, as a mid-range, health-relevant definition for the state [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast to the relative heat events, a single temperature threshold was used for the entire state rather than thresholds derived from local historical data. To find the number of absolute extreme heat events, the number of heat index days for each model, April 1<sup>st</sup> through October 31<sup>st</sup> over the projected period, was counted, averaged, and divided by the number of years in the period to get the average number of heat index events per year per tract. Heat index days were calculated using the &#8220;weathermetrics&#8221; R package [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Change in the number of extreme heat days between the projected period and the current period was calculated.</p>
