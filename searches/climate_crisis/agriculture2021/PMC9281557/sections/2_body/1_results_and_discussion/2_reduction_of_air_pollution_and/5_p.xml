The governors-general were told that the facilities available in past years should not be used this year. Many tourists, leisure, and religious centers have been closed. Schools and universities were closed. The government's guidance was well received by the public. Train travel was reduced by 94%, bus travel by 75%, and air travel by 70%. About 80% of Nowruz's trips were forgone in the first week of the New Year.</p>
