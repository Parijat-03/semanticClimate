As mentioned, design choices activate and allow behaviours. Thorson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>), for example, has argued that there are important differences in the value of new media associated with how the technologies are employed, with &#8220;active&#8221; use (i.e. search over sociability) correlated with more challenging modes of citizenship, or seeking divergent opinion exposure. Matei and Britt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>) provide a useful analysis of Wikipedia as an example of a platform that uses advocacy, creates a social hierarchy in production, but sustains openness to new entrants, accountability, and has sustained itself in the face of attacks on its primary function of knowledge production.</p>
