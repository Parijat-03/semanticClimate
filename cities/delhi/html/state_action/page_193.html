According to the service level benchmarking data book, about 20 percent of the waste generated in the city remains uncollected. The collection and transport of waste may be hurt further with climate change induced fuel price rises. The waste management systems may also be susceptible to high intensity rainfall, as the uncollected waste may clog uncovered drains as well as contaminate groundwater (US EPA, 2013). This could cause an increase in incidences of vector borne diseases in addition to degradation of aesthetic quality of the city of Delhi. Treatment of waste through bacteria may also be affected with increasing temperatures and humidity in the atmosphere. This may cause sub-optimal results in composting and bio-methanation units throughout the city (Patel, 2002) </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="585.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="585.72" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 585.72; y1: 597.72; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="132.62" y0="585.72" x1="526.11" style="x0: 132.62; x1: 139.95; y0: 585.72; y1: 597.72; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Low-lying areas that are more vulnerable to flash floods may be more vulnerable to failures in solid waste management systems. These areas would be at higher risk of increased incidence of infectious diseases. The waste treatment facilities in these areas may also get flooded and therefore cause breakdown of the solid waste management services (Talyan, et al., 2008).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="176.06" top="494.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="494.28" x1="176.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 494.28; y1: 506.28; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity: </span><span x0="177.62" y0="494.28" x1="526.12" style="x0: 177.62; x1: 184.95; y0: 494.28; y1: 506.28; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There have been efforts to streamline collection and transportation of solid waste, through privatization of these services in Delhi. There are now two functioning waste to energy plants in the city of Delhi. These help augment energy supply and reduce waste in the landfill. The privatization programs also include awareness campaigns for waste segregation and suitable waste management practices in the capital. There are also national policies like the National Sustainable Habitat Mission in place that aim at increasing the spread of sustainable solid waste management practices. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="371.26"><span x0="72.02" y0="371.26" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 371.26; y1: 383.26; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Solid waste management services would be impacted by climate change. Low income households and low lying areas would be disproportionately impacted by these changes. The government plans to implement integrated solid waste management services, including basic services and promotion of waste to energy projects in all cities across India as per the National Mission on Sustainable Habitat. Widespread implementation of the aforementioned interventions in a climate resilient manner would help better adapt to these impacts. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="172.7" top="264.88"><span x0="72.02" y0="264.88" x1="172.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 264.88; y1: 275.92; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2.5 Transport </span><span x0="72.02" y0="249.43" x1="526.37" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 249.43; y1: 261.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The transport sector in Delhi is responsible for 30.05 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. The rate of increase in the number of vehicles exceeds the rate of population growth by four times. This number is set to increase with the increase in population and the standards of living.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="127.7" top="185.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="185.95" x1="127.7" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 185.95; y1: 197.95; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Exposure: </span><span x0="129.26" y0="185.95" x1="526.41" style="x0: 129.26; x1: 136.59; y0: 185.95; y1: 197.95; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The increase in the number of vehicles has led to the construction of transport infrastructure, including public transport. Delhi also has the most extensive transport network of any Indian city with about 21 % of its geographical area covered by motorways (City Development Plan, 2010).The change in climate, i.e. rise in temperature and increased intensity of rainfall can lead to a reduction in the lifespan of these systems. High temperature and rainfall can affect sensitive materials that may lose its stability rendering the systems unsafe for use. This can lead to huge losses in public expenditure. There is therefore a need to plan for the </span></div></body></html>
