This is due to the specific situation of Turkey among the Annex I countries, which will be discussed throughout this paper. When Turkey is excluded from the Annex I country group or, in other words, when Mediterranean countries that are part of the EU27 and those that are not are analyzed separately, a vision complementary to the previous one is obtained.</p>
