<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We calculated mean composites from the items within each of the 11 psychological factors. However, we note that factor 11 (theory of change) was novel, and Cronbach's <italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic> = 0.56 for this factor, at both time points. To reach the minimum reliability score of <italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic> = 0.6, one item was dropped, which led to <italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic> = 0.64. All other composites were <italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic> &gt; 0.6 (see electronic supplementary materials for all alphas).</p>
