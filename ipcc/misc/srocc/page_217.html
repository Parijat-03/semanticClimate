Land and land use change therefore alter the state (e.g., chemical composition and air quality, temperature and humidity) and the dynamics (e.g., strength of horizontal and vertical winds) of the atmosphere, which, in turn, can dampen or amplify local climate change. Land-induced changes in energy, moisture and wind can affect neighbouring, and sometimes more distant, areas. For example, deforestation in Brazil warms the surface, in addition to global warming, and enhances convection which increases the relative temperature difference between the land and the ocean, boosting moisture advection from the ocean and thus rainfall further inland.

Terrestrial ecosystems are both sources and sinks of chemical compounds such as nitrogen and ozone. BVOCs contribute to forming tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosols, which respectively effect surface warming and cloud formation. Semi-arid and arid regions release dust, as do cropland areas after harvest. Increasing the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere impacts temperature in both positive and negative ways depending on the particle size, altitude and nature (carbonaceous or mineral, for example). Although global warming will impact the functioning and state of the land (FAQ 2.1), this is not a one-way interaction as changes in land and land use can also affect climate and thus modulate climate change. Understanding this two-way interaction can help improve adaptation and mitigation strategies, as well as manage landscapes.</span></div><div left="83.2" right="381.88" top="327.36"><span style="x0: 83.2; x1: 88.29; y0: 327.36; y1: 338.36; width: 5.09; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="83.2" y0="327.36" x1="381.88">FAQ 2.3 | How does climate change affect water resources?</span></div><div left="83.2" right="553.78" top="312.83"><span style="x0: 83.2; x1: 88.13; y0: 312.83; y1: 322.33; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="83.2" y0="312.83" x1="553.78">Renewable freshwater resources are essential for the survival of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for human use in agriculture, industry and in domestic contexts. As increased water vapour concentrations are expected in a warmer atmosphere, climate change will alter the hydrological cycle and therefore regional freshwater resources. In general, wet regions are projected to get wetter and dry regions drier, although there are regional exceptions to this. The consequent impacts vary regionally; where rainfall is projected to be lower in the future (many arid subtropical regions and those with a Mediterranean climate), a reduction of water resources is expected. Here increased temperatures and decreased rainfall will reduce surface and groundwater resources, increase plant evapotranspiration and increase evaporation rates from open water (rivers, lakes, wetlands) and water supply infrastructure (canals, reservoirs). In regions where rainfall is projected to be higher in the future (many high latitude regions and the wet tropics), an increase in water resources can be expected to bene&#64257;t terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, agriculture and domestic use, however, these bene&#64257;ts may be limited due to increased temperatures. An increase in extreme rainfall events is also expected which will lead to increases in surface runoff, regional &#64258;ooding and nutrient removal as well as a reduction in soil water and groundwater recharge in many places. Anthropogenic land use change may amplify or moderate the climate change effect on water resources, therefore informed land management strategies need to be developed. A warming climate will exacerbate the existing pressures on renewable freshwater resources in water-stressed regions of the Earth and result in increased competition for water between human and natural systems.</span></div></body></html>
