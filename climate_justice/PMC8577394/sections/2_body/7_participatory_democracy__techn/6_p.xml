Callon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>), for example, propose that &#8220;hybrid forums&#8221; composed of experts and laypeople can be productive sites of collaborative decision-making for complex environmental problems, such as decisions about&#160;nuclear waste disposal in France. Schudson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2006</xref>) alternatively suggests that experts can live up to democratic ideals when they use their technical judgement to support the public&#8217;s interests and stand up to governments in the case of controversies. And Futrell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>) found, in his study of chemical weapons disposal, that publicly-accepted and technically-safe decisions can be reached when the government collaborates with citizens, rather than when they lock them out of the process. Less hopeful scholars, however, argue that participatory approaches, if they are too open-ended and loosely formatted, will never produce a decision, let alone consensus. Legitimacy depends on the ability of bringing a controversy to an end, and participatory measures lack mechanisms for doing so (Eyal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). Deliberation can go on forever, and in a participatory forum nobody has the authority to make a decision if consensus is not reached.</p>
