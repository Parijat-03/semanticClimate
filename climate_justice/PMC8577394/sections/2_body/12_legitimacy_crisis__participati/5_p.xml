On the first request, the city restated that no such document existed. Upon insistence, the city released a report titled &#8220;Value Engineering Report,&#8221; which purported to explain the engineering rationale for the change. However, the document was almost entirely redacted with black ink obscuring the substantive text and images, purportedly due to national security reasons. Finally, after further public uproar and pressure from local councilwoman Carlina Rivera, the city published a mostly unredacted engineering study in early 2021. The document reported on a series of meetings held by various city engineering agencies along with outside engineering consultants. The report summarized how engineers pored over technical challenges in closed-door conference rooms to optimize cost-benefit calculations, and concluded to abandon the public plan and produce a simpler design. With the new plan, the cumbersome ConEd utility lines would not have to be moved (corroborating Torres-Springer&#8217;s story) and the project would end up being cheaper. In a section of the report outlining next steps, engineers recommended only one public-facing action: &#8220;Public updates will be needed&#8221; (City of New York Office of Budget and Management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). The experts, then, not only severely underestimated the strong public response to their actions, but in documentation they barely considered how the public would react at all.</p>
