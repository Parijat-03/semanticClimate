Poverty and socioeconomic factors are key determinants of health, affecting nutrition, stress, toxic environmental exposure, access to the outdoors, access to education, and an increased chance of risky behaviour [<xref rid="B38-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Black, indigenous, and other people of colour are disproportionately affected. Human-caused ecological degradation of the natural world has a multitude of detrimental effects on human health [<xref rid="B42-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Children are particularly vulnerable, due to the immaturity and plasticity of tissues and organ systems, as well as their disproportionately greater uptake due to normal physiology and behaviour [<xref rid="B43-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They will also be most impacted in the future by widespread ecological and societal breakdown due to climate devastation [<xref rid="B45-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Vulnerable and marginalized populations are the first and most significantly affected by environmental impacts [<xref rid="B46-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
