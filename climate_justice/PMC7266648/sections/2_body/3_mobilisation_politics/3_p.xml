Bennett&#8217;s model emphasises a focus on concern for specific issues as a primary driver for the &#8220;hit-and-run&#8221; participation of everyday making, combined with modes of participation that are more informal and expressive. This not only sits within a post-modern/post-war notion of justice as including recognition as well as other &#8220;rightscentric&#8221; motivators, but also recognises that the large participation rates in political organisations in the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century might have less to do with their political functions, as much as their provision of social services, recreational opportunities and networking resources.</p>
