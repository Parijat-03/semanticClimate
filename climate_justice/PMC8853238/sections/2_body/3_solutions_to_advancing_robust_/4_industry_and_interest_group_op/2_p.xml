In addition, there are pathways available to reduce their power, if they cannot be won over. Basseches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>) finds that in states like California and Massachusetts, with restructured electricity sectors in which IOUs no longer own fossil fuel generation, a suite of policies rewarding IOUs financially for promoting energy efficiency can neutralize opposition to economy-wide GHG reduction policies. IOUs have supported ambitious RPS policies in other states, like Oregon, as well (Basseches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). States where IOUs support climate policy are likely to be &#8220;blue states&#8221; (Adua and Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>), consistent with the literature on the role of partisanship in climate policymaking (e.g., Coley and Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Fowler and Breen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2013</xref>; Vasseur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2014</xref>). Unfortunately, this strategy of leveraging IOUs&#8217; political power does not work for net metering policies, which IOUs oppose, even in the blue states (Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2016</xref>). Still, Smith et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2021</xref>) suggest that IOUs&#8217; opposition to net metering can be mitigated by policy designs that give utilities credit toward their RPS requirements when their customers install solar panels.</p>
