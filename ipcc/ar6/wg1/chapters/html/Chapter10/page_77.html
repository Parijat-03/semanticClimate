The multiple lines of evidence for the climate information may conflict, thus requiring distillation of the evidence (Section&#160;10.5) to arrive at climate-change statements. When moving from global climate information to climate information at the regional scale, following the structure above provides a&#160;basis for arriving at relevant and credible climate information. The comprehensive examples of distilling climate information thus show the value of working with multiple lines of evidence to develop robust climate change information for a&#160;region.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="582.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="582.6" x1="304.72" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 58.99; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In addition to the three comprehensive examples, this section contains two additional examples analysing multiple sources of regional climate information.

Problems with water supply in many large cities in developing countries are endemic and rarely reported internationally. The water crisis in Cape Town attracted considerable international attention to a&#160;city with functional government structures, well-developed services (compared to other urban centres in Africa), a&#160;centre of international tourism, and an economic hub with GDP of 22&#160;billion USD (about 7,500 USD per capita, Gallie et&#160;al., 2018). Economic and social impacts of the crisis were significant. Loss of revenue for companies of all sizes resulted not only from the scaling down of water-dependent activities, but also from the need to invest in water-efficient technologies and processes. Tourism was affected through reduced arrivals and&#160;bookings, although only temporarily (CTT, 2018). In the agricultural sector, 30,000 people were laid-off and production dropped by 20% (Piennaar and Boonzaaier, 2018). The crisis initially polarized society, with conflict emerging between various water users and erosion of trust in the government, but eventually social cohesion and an acute awareness of limited water resources emerged (Robins, 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.07; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">multi-year meteorological drought (Figure&#160;10.18), estimated at 1 in 300 years (Wolski, 2018), and factors related to the nature of the water supply system, operational water management and water resource policies. Cape Town was very successful in implementing water-saving actions after the previous drought of 2000&#8211;2003, reducing water losses from over 22% to 15% (Frame and Killick, 2007; DWA, 2013), breaking the previous coupling of growth in water demand with growth in population. As a&#160;consequence, Cape Town won a&#160;Water Smart City award from the C40 Cities program only three years prior to the crisis. However, the water-saving actions, together with changing priorities in water resource provision from infrastructure-oriented towards resource and demand management, may well have led to delays in implementation of the expansion of water supply infrastructure (Muller, 2018). The expansion plan, formulated a&#160;decade prior to the crisis, included an expectation of long-term climate-change drying in the region (DWAF, 2007). The crisis also exposed structural deficiencies of water management and inadequacy of a&#160;policy process in which decisions about local water resources are taken at a&#160;national level, particularly in a&#160;situation of political tension (Visser, 2018). The crisis was widely seen as a&#160;harbinger of future problems to be faced by the city, and a&#160;highlight of vulnerability of many cities in the world resulting from the interplay of three factors: (i) the fast urban-population growth, (ii)&#160;the economic, policy, infrastructural and water resource paradigms and constraints, and (iii) anthropogenic climate change.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="434.12" top="414.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="414.48" x1="434.12" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.2 The Region&#8217;s Climate</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="390.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="390.6" x1="563.23" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 390.6; y1: 400.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An evaluation of the relative role of rainfall and temperature signal in the 2015&#8211;2017 hydrological drought gives a&#160;strong indication that lack of rainfall was the primary driver (Otto et&#160;al., 2018) leading to the 2018 water crisis. Thus, the remainder of this section focuses on rainfall. Section&#160;11.6 offers a&#160;discussion of African drought over broader areas, including mechanisms relevant to them.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="306.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="306.6" x1="563.23" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.31; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Cape Town is located at the south-western tip of Africa, within an approximately 100 km &#215; 300 km region that receives 80% of its rainfall during the austral winter (March to October), with the largest portion in June to August. In the vicinity of Cape Town, rainfall is strongly heterogeneous, ranging from about 300&#160;mm/year on coastal plains to &gt;2,000&#160;mm/year in mountain ranges. The Cape Town water supply relies on surface water reservoirs located in a&#160;few small mountain catchments (about 800 km</span><span x0="446.88" y0="226.76" x1="449.54" style="x0: 446.88; x1: 449.54; y0: 226.76; y1: 232.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2</span><span x0="451.46" y0="222.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 451.46; x1: 453.57; y0: 222.6; y1: 232.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">in total). The Cape Town region receives 85% of its rainfall from a&#160;series of cold fronts forming within mid-latitude cyclones. The remainder is brought in by infrequent cut-off lows that occur throughout the year (Favre et&#160;al., 2013). This creates a&#160;very strong water resource dependency on a&#160;single rainfall delivery mechanism that may be strongly affected by anthropogenic climate change (Chapter&#160;4 and Section&#160;10.6.2.6).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="126.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The 2015&#8211;2017 drought had strong low-rainfall anomalies in shoulder seasons (March to May and September to November, though weaker in the latter), and average rainfall in June and July (Sousa et&#160;al., 2018a; Mahlalela et&#160;al., 2019). The anomaly resulted from fewer rainfall events and lower average intensity of events. The anomaly was strongest in the mountainous region where the water supply system&#8217;s catchments are located (Wolski et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div></body></html>
