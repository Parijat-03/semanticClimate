In this work, referring to adaptation and transformation properties, resilience is considered as the capacity to react, recover and bounce forward (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aldieri et&#160;al., 2022</xref>). It emerges a clear role for microfinance instruments in terms of resilience policy due to their long-run development action. Allowing for improved financial inclusion, microfinance contributes to empowering the vulnerable, acting on all spheres of sustainability. The contribution of microfinance to boosting micro-entrepreneurship and alleviating poverty is of utmost importance. Its possible socioeconomic impact has been widely discussed within the academic and policymaking communities, especially when addressing development problems existing in the Global South (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Churchill, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">van Rooyen et&#160;al., 2012</xref>).</p>
