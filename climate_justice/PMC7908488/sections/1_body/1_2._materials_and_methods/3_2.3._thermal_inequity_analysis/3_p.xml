However, certain influences from biophysical variables could not be removed. Differences in elevation and proximity to water bodies, for example, may affect neighborhood temperatures. Literature related to socioeconomic inequities often compares population subsets such as the top and bottom deciles [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For our study, using these relatively large subsets of census block groups meant that the effect of such biophysical variables would be minimized. This method also helps convey the extent of disparities between the poorest and wealthiest in society and the wide gaps found today among different demographic groups.</p>
