Before the Copenhagen Summit, for example, China&#8217;s Special Envoy for climate change&#8212;Yu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2009a</xref>) emphasized that &#8216;no matter China or Bahamas, as the developing countries, we are both victims&#8217; and it is unfair to require developing countries to &#8216;undertake similar obligations with those of developed countries&#8217;. Yu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2009b</xref>) also argued that China &#8216;will never accept the idea that the Chinese people should only enjoy one third, one fourth or even one fifth of the rights and interests of the people of developed countries&#8217;. At the Summit, China&#8217;s Premier Wen Jiabao stated:<disp-quote><p id="Par27">Developing countries only started industrialization a few decades ago and many of their people still live in abject poverty today. It is totally unjustified to ask them to undertake emission reduction targets beyond their due obligations and capabilities in disregard of historical responsibilities, per capita emissions and different levels of development. Developed countries, which are already leading an affluent life, still maintain a level of per capita emissions that is far higher than that of developing countries, and most of their emissions are attributed to consumption. In comparison, emissions from developing countries are primarily survival emissions and international transfer emissions (Wen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2009</xref>).</p></disp-quote></p>
