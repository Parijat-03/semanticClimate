Although angry about what they perceived as the city&#8217;s switch to a technocratic decision-making style, these residents preferred a flawed plan to no flood protection. They prioritized security over other issues such as keeping the park open for recreation during the construction period. Residents emphasized their spatial location in the neighborhood and self-identified low-status as residents of waterfront public housing to anchor their priorities, often narrating their experiences during Sandy and invoking their current exposure to storms.
