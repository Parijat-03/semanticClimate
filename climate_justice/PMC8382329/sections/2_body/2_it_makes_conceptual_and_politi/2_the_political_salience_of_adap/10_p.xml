Being &#8220;green&#8221; is a response by companies to increasing green consumerism, and it is also a matter of corporate prestige. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development in a recent policy paper (WBCSD,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2019</xref>) strongly supports introducing carbon pricing, which they see as providing policy certainty and enhancing competitiveness. An increasingly informed public, more climate-friendly businesses, the growth of transnational civil society, and increasing public-private partnerships are facts of a globalized world. Given intensely growing pressure at all levels, the possibility of extra-budgetary resources for climate finance does not appear far-fetched.</p>
