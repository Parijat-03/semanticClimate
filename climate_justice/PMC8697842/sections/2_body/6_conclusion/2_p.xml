However, if a country targets CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and environmental sustainability, other factors such as energy intensity, carbon intensity, and fuel structure should have decreasing effects on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the present study, however, the researcher has proven that only the energy intensity contributed significantly to Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> reduction goals. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the energy intensity curbed the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of Australia cumulatively by 165,163 ktons. The carbon intensity accelerated the country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy structure reduced them only by a minimal amount. Empirical findings revealed that Australia should decrease oil and coal use in total energy consumption. Additionally, it should increase the renewable energy share, especially in electricity generation.</p>
