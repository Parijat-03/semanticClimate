      <td>often criticized for the lack of statistical significance and the inability to disentangle cause and effect (Barnes, 2013; Barnes and\nPolvani, 2013; Screen and Simmonds, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Barnes and Screen, 2015; Sorokina et al.,\n2016; Douville et al., 2017; Gastineau et al., 2017; Blackport and Screen, 2020a; Oudar et al., 2020; Riboldi et al., 2020). The role of the\nBarents-Kara sea ice loss is challenged by Blackport et al. (2019) who find a minimal influence of reduced sea ice on severe mid-latitude\nwinters, and by Warner et al. (2020) who suggest that the apparent winter NAO response to the Barents-Kara sea ice variability is\nmainly an artefact of the Aleutian Low internal variability and of the co-variability between sea ice and the Aleutian Low originating\nfrom tropical-extratropical teleconnections. Also Gong et al. (2020) do not find a link between Rossby wave propagation into the\nmid-latitudes and Arctic sea ice loss. Mori et al. (2019) argue that models underestimate the influence of the Barents-Kara Sea ice\nloss on the atmosphere, which is disputed by Screen and Blackport (2019). Other studies have stressed the importance of atmospheric\nvariability as a driver of Arctic variability (Lee, 2014; Woods and Caballero, 2016; Praetorius et al., 2018; Olonscheck et al., 2019).\nAnalysing observed key variables of mid-latitude climate for 1980&#8211;2020, Blackport and Screen (2020b) and Riboldi et al. (2020) argue\nthat the Arctic influence on mid-latitudes is small compared to other aspects of climate variability, and that observed periods of strong\ncorrelation are an artefact of internal variability or intermittency (Kolstad and Screen, 2019; Siew et al., 2020; Warner et al., 2020).</td>

      <td>An additional argument in the criticism is the inability of climate models to simulate a significant response to Arctic sea ice loss, larger\nthan the natural variability (Screen et al., 2014; Walsh, 2014; H.W. Chen et al., 2016; Peings et al., 2017; Dai and Song, 2020), or that\na very large multi-model ensemble is needed (Liang et al., 2020), although some studies find a significant response in summer, because\nthen the internal variability is weaker (Petrie et al., 2015).</td>

      <td>Finally, a warmer Arctic climate can, without any additional changes in atmospheric dynamics, reduce cold extremes in winter\ndue to advection of increasingly warmer air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes (Screen, 2014; Ayarzag&#252;ena and Screen, 2016;\nAyarzag&#252;ena et al., 2018).</td>

      <td>Summarizing, different hypotheses have been developed about the influence of recent Arctic warming on the mid-latitudes in both\nwinter and summer. Although some of the proposed mechanisms seem to be supported by various studies, the underlying mechanisms\nand relative strength compared to internal climate variability have been questioned. A recent review (Cohen et al., 2020) states that\ndivergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and also between different model studies, continue to obfuscate\na clear understanding of how Arctic warming is influencing mid-latitude weather. In this context, Shepherd (2016b) stresses the need\nfor collaboration between scientists with different viewpoints for further understanding that could be achieved by carefully designed,\nmulti-investigator, coordinated, multi-model simulations, data analyses and diagnostics (Overland et al., 2016). In agreement with\nBox 3.2 of SROCC, there is low to medium confidence in the exact role and quantitative effect of historical Arctic warming and sea ice\nloss on mid-latitude atmospheric variability.</td>

      <td>Regarding future climate, it is important to note that mid-latitude variability is also affected by many drivers other than the Arctic\nchanges and that those drivers as well as the linkages to mid-latitude variability might change in a warmer world. The AMV, PDV,\nENSO (see Annex IV), upper tropospheric tropical heating, polar stratospheric vortex, and land surface processes associated with soil\nmoisture (Miralles et al., 2014; Hauser et al., 2016) and snow cover (Nakamura et al., 2019; Sato and Nakamura, 2019) are a few\nexamples. A considerable body of literature has shown that changes to the NAO/AO on seasonal and climate change time scales\ncan be driven by variations in the wavelength and amplitude of Rossby waves, mainly of tropical origin (Fletcher and Kushner, 2011;\nCattiaux and Cassou, 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Goss et al., 2016). The influence of future Arctic warming on mid-latitude circulation\nis difficult to disentangle from the effect of such a plethora of drivers (Blackport and Kushner, 2017; F. Li et al., 2018). One of the\nconsequences of climate change is a poleward shift of the jet induced by the tropical warming (Barnes and Polvani, 2013), which is\nless obvious in winter especially over the North Atlantic (Peings et al., 2018; Oudar et al., 2020), and the increase of the meridional\ntemperature gradient in the upper troposphere, which increases storm track activity (Barnes and Screen, 2015; Parding et al., 2019).\nAlthough climate models indicate that future Arctic warming and the associated equator&#8211;pole temperature gradient decrease could\naffect mid-latitude climate and variability (Haarsma et al., 2013a; McCusker et al., 2017; Zappa et al., 2018), and even the tropics and\nsubtropics (Deser et al., 2015; Cvijanovic et al., 2017; K. Wang et al., 2018; England et al., 2020; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020), they do\nnot reveal a strong influence on extreme weather (Woollings et al., 2014).</td>

      <td>In conclusion, there is low confidence in the relative contribution of Arctic warming to mid-latitude atmospheric changes compared to\nother drivers. Future climate change could affect mid-latitude variability in a number of ways that are still to be clarified, and which\nmay also include the influence of Arctic warming. The linkages between the Arctic warming and the mid-latitude circulation are an\nexample of contrasting lines of evidence that cannot yet be reconciled (Section 10.5).</td>
