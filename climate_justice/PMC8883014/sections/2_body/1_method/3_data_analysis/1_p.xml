First, a series of preliminary analyses were conducted, including computation of descriptive statistics for all variables in the analysis and a correlation matrix. Independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and chi-square analysis were used to compare the 284 participants in the analytic sample and the 39 participants who were dropped due to missing data. Second, two multivariable linear regression models were run to examine the CCA subscales and individual action and climate activism as predictors of MDD and GAD symptoms, respectively, controlling for demographic covariates and direct climate change experience. Third, we examined individual climate action and climate activism as moderators of the two CCA subscales using Model 1 of the PROCESS macro (Hayes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>). A total of eight moderation models were run, four for MDD symptoms and four for GAD symptoms, and each with one interaction term. Variables comprising interaction terms were mean-centered, and interactions were then computed as their product. Centered variables, interactions, and covariates were entered as predictors of the dependent variable. In cases of significant interaction terms, the conditional effects of CCA at low (1 standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] below the mean), mean, and high (1 SD above the mean) levels of the moderator were recorded, and predicted values were plotted in Microsoft Excel.</p>
