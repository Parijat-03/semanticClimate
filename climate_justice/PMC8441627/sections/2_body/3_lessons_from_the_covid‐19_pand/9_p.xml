<p>How do we go forward? Hexagram 42, &#8216;Increase&#8217;, in the Chinese book of wisdom, the <italic toggle="yes">I Ching</italic>, offers us an archetypal framework for the future. The message of the hexagram, an archetypal image, is that those with power in whatever form, come down to help the less fortunate. The Wilhelm/Baynes translation declares:
<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="joap12675-blkfxd-0001"><p>This conception &#8230; expresses the fundamental idea on which the <italic toggle="yes">Book of Changes</italic> is based. To rule truly is to serve.</p><p>A sacrifice of the higher element that produces an increase of the lower is called an out&#8208;and&#8208;out increase: <italic toggle="yes">it indicates the spirit that alone has power to help the world</italic>.</p><attrib>(Wilhelm&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>, p. 162; italics added)</attrib></disp-quote>As with any archetype, it is a pattern that can be seen across many levels. It relates to income inequality and the increasing gap between the haves and the have&#8208;nots; racism and sexism; political and social inequalities; and to people with no or inadequate health care coverage.</p>
