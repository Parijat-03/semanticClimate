For instance, the Berlin Landscape Programme includes &#64257;ve plans, one of which covers adapting to climate change through the recognition of the role of UGI (Green Surge 2016). Major climate-related challenges facing Durban, South Africa, include sea level rise, urban heat island, water runoff and conservation (Roberts and&#160;O&#8217;Donoghue 2013). Now considered a&#160;global leader in climate adaptation planning (Roberts 2010), Durban&#8217;s Climate Change Adaptation plan includes the retention and maintenance of natural ecosystems, in particular those that are important for mitigating &#64258;ooding, coastal erosion, water pollution, wetland siltation and climate change (eThekwini Municipal Council 2014).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="300.35" top="567.42"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.11; y0: 567.42; y1: 577.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="567.42" x1="300.35">1.9.2 Perennial grains and soil organic carbon (SOC) </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="543.52"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 543.52; y1: 553.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="543.52" x1="312.98">The severe ecological perturbation that is inherent in the conversion of native perennial vegetation to annual crops, and the subsequent high frequency of perturbation required to maintain annual crops, results in at least four forms of soil degradation that will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change (Crews et al. 2016). First, soil erosion is a&#160;very serious consequence of annual cropping, with median losses exceeding rates of formation by one to two orders of magnitude in conventionally plowed agroecosystems, and while erosion is reduced with conservation tillage, median losses still exceed formation by several fold (Montgomery 2007). More severe storm intensity associated with climate change is expected to cause even greater losses to wind and water erosion (Nearing et al. 2004). Second, the periods of time in which live roots are reduced or altogether absent from soils in annual cropping systems allow for substantial losses of nitrogen from fertilised croplands, averaging 50% globally (Ladha et al. 2005). This low retention of nitrogen is also expected to worsen with more intense weather events (Bowles et al. 2018). A&#160;third impact of annual cropping is the degradation of soil structure caused by tillage, which can reduce in&#64257;ltration of precipitation, and increase surface runoff. It is predicted that the percentage of precipitation that in&#64257;ltrates into agricultural soils will decrease further under climate-change scenarios (Basche and DeLonge 2017; Wuest et al. 2006). The fourth form of soil degradation that results from annual cropping is the reduction of soil organic matter (SOM), a&#160;topic of particular relevance to climate change mitigation and adaptation. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.98" top="231.56"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.54; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="231.56" x1="312.98">Undegraded cropland soils can theoretically hold far more SOM (which is about 58% carbon) than they currently do (Soussana et al. 2006). We know this de&#64257;ciency because, with few exceptions, comparisons between cropland soils and those of proximate mature native ecosystems commonly show a&#160;40&#8211;75% decline in soil carbon attributable to agricultural practices. What happens when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture that induces such signi&#64257;cant losses of SOM? Wind and water erosion commonly results in preferential removal of light organic matter fractions that can accumulate on or near the soil surface (Lal 2003). In addition to the effects of erosion, the fundamental practices of growing annual food and &#64257;bre crops alters both inputs and outputs of organic matter from most agroecosystems, resulting in net reductions in soil carbon equilibria (Soussana et al. 2006; McLauchlan 2006; Crews et al. 2016).

When perennial vegetation is replaced by annual crops, inputs of root-associated carbon (roots, exudates, mycorrhizae) decline substantially. For example, perennial grassland species allocate around 67% of productivity to roots, whereas annual crops allocate between 13&#8211;30% (Saugier 2001; Johnson et al. 2006). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.46" top="627.6"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 627.6; y1: 637.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="627.6" x1="571.46">At the same time, inputs of SOC are reduced in annual cropping systems, and losses are increased because of tillage, compared to native perennial vegetation. Tillage breaks apart soil aggregates which, among other functions, are thought to inhibit soil bacteria, fungi and other microbes from consuming and decomposing SOM (Grandy and Neff 2008). Aggregates reduce microbial access to organic matter by restricting physical access to mineral-stabilised organic compounds as well as reducing oxygen availability (Cotrufo et al. 2015; Lehmann and Kleber 2015).

The menu of approaches being investigated focuses either on increasing below-ground carbon inputs, usually through increases in total crop productivity, or by decreasing microbial activity, usually through reduced soil disturbance (Crews and Rumsey 2017). However, the basic biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems managed for production of annual crops presents serious challenges to achieving the standing stocks of SOC accumulated by native ecosystems that preceded agriculture. A&#160;novel new approach that is just starting to receive signi&#64257;cant attention is the development of perennial cereal, legume and oilseed crops (Glover et al. 2010; Baker 2017). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.46" top="291.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 291.54; y1: 301.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="291.54" x1="571.46">There are two basic strategies that plant breeders and geneticists are using to develop new perennial grain crop species.
