<bold>Major Depression Disorder symptoms</bold> were measured using the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009b</xref>). The PHQ-8 assesses eight of the nine criteria for MDD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), excluding symptoms of suicidality (American Psychiatric Association, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1994</xref>). Participants were asked to report how often during the past two weeks they were bothered by each of the eight symptoms described. Response options ranged from 0&#8201;=&#8201;Not at all to 3&#8201;=&#8201;Nearly every day. Sum scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating greater severity of MDD symptoms, and scores of 10 or above considered indicative of a probable MDD diagnosis (Kroenke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009b</xref>). Reliability in the current sample was good (total score &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.88).</p>
