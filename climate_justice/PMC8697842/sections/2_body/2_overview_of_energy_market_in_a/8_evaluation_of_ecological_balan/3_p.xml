Additionally, the ecological footprint per person was 8 gha in 1990, and 8 gha, 8.3 gha, and 7.3 gha in the years 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively (GFN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). The ecological reserve per person was calculated as 10.3 gha for the year 1990. However, as the biocapacity in Australia declined and the ecological footprint increased, per person ecological reserve was therefore calculated as 9.4 gha, 5.5 gha, and 5.3 gha for the years 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively.</p>
