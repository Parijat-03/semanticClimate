<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0145">In most, if not all cases, successful CM or MR requires institutional or community support in relocation sites and from the receiving communities. There are very few examples of &#8216;successful resettlement&#8217; in the current literature. This is, partly, because it is unclear what &#8220;success&#8221; means for different stakeholders and how this is measured especially by CDPs, receiving communities, those left behind, NGOs, local authorities, national government, and the international community. This gap in knowledge represents an opportunity for future empirical studies.</p>
