<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0070">In this study, we compiled a unique spatial&#8211;temporal data-set that captures the main drivers and risk factors of WNV infections in Europe, based on findings from the conceptual framework. Since WNV infection data is only available at the European NUTS 3 level (aggregated areal health data), our empirical strategy relies on aggregated areal health data. We selected regions for the study where autochthonous virus transmission had occurred at least once over the reporting period in the selected countries. By applying this criteria, we were left with 166 regions in total for the analysis. We assumed that all regions included in the study could be influenced by migratory birds that form part of the African and European flyways <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
