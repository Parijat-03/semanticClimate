<bold>Open-ended questions</bold> were included at the end of the survey&#160;including: 1) &#8220;What, if anything, worries you most about climate change?&#8221; and 2) &#8220;What, if anything, do you do on a regular basis to address climate change?&#8221; We used written open-ended accounts to allow participants to take their time, reflect independently without researcher presence, and focus on experiences most salient to them. Anonymity also may reduce social desirability and facilitate candor (Braun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p>
