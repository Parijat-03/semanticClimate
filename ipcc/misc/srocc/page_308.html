Launched in 2007, this regional project aims to restore Africa&#8217;s degraded arid landscapes, reduce the loss of biodiversity and support local communities to sustainable use of forests and rangelands. The Great Green Wall focuses on establishing plantations and neighbouring projects, covering a&#160;distance of 7775 km from Senegal on the Atlantic coast to Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, with a&#160;width of 15 km (Figure&#160;3.13). The wall passes through Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal. </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.26" top="111.55"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 111.55; y1: 121.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="111.55" x1="307.26">The choice of woody and herbaceous species that will be used to restore degraded ecosystems is based on biophysical and socio-economic criteria, including socio-economic value (food, pastoral, commercial, energetic, medicinal, cultural); ecological importance (carbon sequestration, soil cover, water in&#64257;ltration); </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.82" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.17; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="387.56" x1="565.82">and resilience to climate change and variability. The Pan-African Agency of the Great Green Wall (PAGGW) was created in 2010 under the auspices of the African Union and CEN-SAD to manage the project.

Today, countries have changed their strategies and opted for rural development projects that can be more easily funded. Examples of scalable practices for land restoration include managing water bodies for livestock and crop production, and promoting fodder trees to reduce runoff (Mbow 2017).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.84" top="183.58"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 321.99; y0: 183.58; y1: 193.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="183.58" x1="565.84">The implementation of the initiative has already started in several countries. For example, the FAO&#8217;s Action Against Deserti&#64257;cation project was restoring 18,000 hectares of land in 2018 through planting native tree species in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal (Sacande 2018). Berrahmouni et al. (2016) estimated that 166 Mha can be restored in the Sahel, requiring the restoration of 10 Mha per year to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality targets by 2030. Despite these early implementation actions on the ground, the achievement of the planned targets is questionable, and will be challenging without signi&#64257;cant additional funding. </span></div><div left="59.6" right="231.6" top="414.38"><span style="x0: 59.6; x1: 63.3; y0: 414.38; y1: 422.38; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.6" y0="414.38" x1="231.6">Figure&#160;3.12 |  Location of the Green Dam in Algeria </span><span style="x0: 231.59; x1: 233.67; y0: 414.31; y1: 422.31; width: 2.07; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="231.59" y0="414.31" x1="497.78">(Sai&#64257; et al. 2015).
