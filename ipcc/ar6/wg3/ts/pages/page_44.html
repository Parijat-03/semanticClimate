Climate policies, other policies and regulations, innovation in competing technologies, and shifts in fuel prices could all lead to stranded assets. The loss of wealth from stranded assets would create risks for financial market stabilityand reduce fiscal revenue for hydrocarbon-dependent economies, which&#160;in turn could affect macroeconomic stability and the prospects for a&#160;Just Transition.

About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will remain unburnable&#160;if warming is limited to 2&#176;C. {6.7, Box&#160;6.11} </span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.46" top="582.61"><span x0="65.2" y0="582.61" x1="543.46" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 582.61; y1: 592.11; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Practically all&#160;long-lived technologies and investments that cannot be adapted to low-carbon and zero-emission modes could face stranding&#160;under climate policy&#160;&#8211; depending on their current age and expected lifetimes. Scenario evidence suggests that without carbon capture, the worldwide fleet of&#160;coal- and gas power plants&#160;would&#160;need to retire about 23 and 17 years earlier&#160;than expected lifetimes, respectively,&#160;in order&#160;to&#160;limit global warming to 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C {2.7}.&#160;Blast furnaces and cement factories without CCS {11.4}, new fleets of airplanes and internal combustion engine vehicles {10.4, 10.5}, and new urban infrastructures adapted to sprawl and motorisation may also be stranded. {Chapter&#160;8; Box&#160;10.1}</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.45" top="498.63"><span x0="65.2" y0="498.63" x1="543.45" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.59; y0: 498.63; y1: 508.13; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Many countries, businesses, and individuals stand to lose wealth from stranded assets. Countries, businesses, and individuals may therefore desire to keep assets in operation even if financial, social, or environmental concerns call for retirement. This creates political economic risks, including actions by asset owners to hinder climate policy reform {6.7; Box&#160;6.11}. It will be easier to retire these assets if&#160;the&#160;risks are communicated, if sustainability reporting is mandated and enforced, and if corporations&#160;are protected&#160;with arrangements that shield them from short-term shareholder value maximisation.&#160;</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.46" top="426.63"><span x0="65.2" y0="426.63" x1="543.46" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.76; y0: 426.63; y1: 436.13; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Without early retirements, or reductions in utilisation, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C {2.7}. Including the pipeline of planned investments would push these future emissions into the uncertainty range of 2&#176;C carbon budgets {2.7}. Continuing to build new coal-fired power plants and other fossil infrastructure will increase future transition costs and may jeopardise efforts to limit warming to 2&#176;C (&gt;67%) or 1.5&#176;C with no or limited overshoot. One study has estimated that USD11.8 trillion in current assets will need to be stranded by 2050 for a&#160;2&#176;C world; further delaying action for another 10 years would result in an additional USD7.7 trillion in stranded assets by 2050. {15.5.2}&#160;&#160;</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.38" top="342.64"><span x0="65.2" y0="342.64" x1="543.38" style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.6; y0: 342.64; y1: 352.14; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Experience from past stranding&#160;indicates&#160;that compensation for the devaluation costs of private-sector stakeholders by the public sector is common.&#160;Limiting new investments in fossil technologies hence also reduces public finance risks in the long term. {15.6.3}</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.26" top="294.65"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.83; y0: 294.65; y1: 304.15; width: 5.8; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="294.65" x1="299.26">A low-carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic opportunities (</span><span style="x0: 210.47; x1: 215.4; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCnIta;" x0="210.47" y0="282.65" x1="272.72">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 272.72; x1: 275.54; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="272.72" y0="282.65" x1="280.12">). </span><span x0="279.37" y0="282.65" x1="299.07" style="x0: 279.37; x1: 283.59; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if warming is limited to 2&#176;C or lower (&gt;67%), or if warming is limited to 1.5&#176;C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot.
