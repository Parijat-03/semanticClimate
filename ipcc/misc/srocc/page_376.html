They are legitimate metrics when used appropriately, but in many cases they involve oversimpli&#64257;cations and yield misleading results (Fensholt et al. 2015; Prince et al. 1998). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.56" top="663.53"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.57; y0: 663.53; y1: 673.03; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="663.53" x1="307.56">Furthermore, increases in NPP do not always indicate improvement in land condition/reversal of land degradation, since this does not account for changes in vegetation composition. It could, for example, result from conversion of native forest to plantation, or due to bush encroachment, which many consider to be a&#160;form of land degradation (Ward 2005). Also, NPP may be increased by irrigation, which can enhance productivity in the short to medium term while increasing risk of soil salinisation in the long term (Niedertscheider et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="555.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="555.55" x1="307.58">Recent progress and expanding time series of canopy characterisations based on passive microwave satellite sensors have offered rapid progress in regional and global descriptions of forest degradation and recovery trends (Tian et al. 2017). The most common proxy is vertical optical depth (VOD) and has already been used to describe global forest/savannah carbon stock shifts over two decades, highlighting strong continental contrasts (Liu et al. 2015a) and demonstrating the value of this approach to monitor forest degradation at large scales. Contrasting with NDVI, which is only sensitive to vegetation &#8216;greenness&#8217;, from which primary production can be modelled, VOD is also sensitive to water in woody parts of the vegetation and hence provides a&#160;view of vegetation dynamics that can be complementary to NDVI. As well as the NDVI, VOD also needs to be corrected to take into account the rainfall variation (Andela et al. 2013).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="375.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.93; y0: 375.57; y1: 385.07; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="375.57" x1="307.6">Even though remote sensing offers much potential, its application to land degradation and recovery remains challenging as structural changes often occur at scales below the detection capabilities of most remote-sensing technologies. Additionally, if the remote sensing is based on vegetation index data, other forms of land degradation, such as nutrient depletion, changes of soil physical or biological properties, loss of values for humans, among others, cannot be inferred directly by remote sensing. The combination of remotely sensed images and &#64257;eld-based approach can give improved estimates of carbon stocks and tree biodiversity (Imai et al. 2012; Fujiki et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="231.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 231.58; y1: 241.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="231.58" x1="307.55">Additionally, the majority of trend techniques employed would be capable of detecting only the most severe of degradation processes, and would therefore not be useful as a&#160;degradation early-warning system (Higginbottom et al. 2014; Wessels et al. 2012). However, additional analyses using higher-resolution imagery, such as the Landsat and SPOT satellites, would be well suited to providing further localised information on trends observed (Higginbottom et al. 2014). New approaches to assess land degradation using high spatial resolution are developing, but the need for time series makes progress slow. The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been shown to be advantageous for the estimation of soil surface characteristics, in particular, surface roughness and soil moisture (Gao et al. 2017; Bousbih et al. 2017), and detecting and quantifying selective logging (Lei et al. 2018). Continued research effort is required to enable full assessment of land degradation using remote sensing.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.62"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 735.62; y1: 745.12; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.62" x1="566.12">Computer simulation models can be used alone or combined with the remote sensing observations to assess land degradation. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) can be used, to some extent, to predict the long-term average annual soil loss by water erosion. RUSLE has been constantly revisited to estimate soil loss based on the product of rainfall&#8211;runoff erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness factor, conservation factor, and support practice parameter (Nampak et al. 2018). Inherent limitations of RUSLE include data-sparse regions, inability to account for soil loss from gully erosion or mass wasting events, and that it does not predict sediment pathways from hillslopes to water bodies (Benavidez et al. 2018). Since RUSLE models only provide gross erosion, the integration of a&#160;further module in the RUSLE scheme to estimate the sediment yield from the modelled hillslopes is needed. The spatially distributed sediment delivery model, WaTEM/SEDEM, has been widely tested in Europe (Borrelli et al. 2018). Wind erosion is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the modelling of soil erosion (Webb et al. 2017a, 2016). Additional models need to be developed to include the limitations of the RUSLE models.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="495.65"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 495.65; y1: 505.15; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="495.65" x1="566.08">Regarding the &#64257;eld-based approach to assess land degradation, there are multiple indicators that re&#64258;ect functional ecosystem processes linked to ecosystem services and thus to the value for humans. These indicators are a&#160;composite set of measurable attributes from different factors, such as climate, soil, vegetation, biomass, management, among others, that can be used together or separately to develop indexes to better assess land degradation (Allen et al. 2011; Kosmas et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="387.66"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 387.66; y1: 397.16; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="387.66" x1="566.13">Declines in vegetation cover, changes in vegetation structure, decline in mean species abundances, decline in habitat diversity, changes in abundance of speci&#64257;c indicator species, reduced vegetation health and productivity, and vegetation management intensity and use, are the most common indicators in the vegetation condition of forest and woodlands (Stocking et al. 2001; Wiesmair et al. 2017; Ghazoul and Chazdon 2017; Alkemade et al. 2009). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="291.67"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 291.67; y1: 301.17; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="291.67" x1="566.11">Several indicators of the soil quality (SOM, depth, structure, compaction, texture, pH,&#160;C:N ratio, aggregate size distribution and stability, microbial respiration, soil organic carbon, salinisation, among others) have been proposed (Schoenholtz et al. 2000) (Section&#160;2.2). Among these, SOM directly and indirectly drives the majority of soil functions. Decreases in SOM can lead to a&#160;decrease in fertility and biodiversity, as well as a&#160;loss of soil structure, causing reductions in water-holding capacity, increased risk of erosion (both wind and water) and increased bulk density and hence soil compaction (Allen et al. 2011; Certini 2005; Conant et al. 2011a). Thus, indicators related with the quantity and quality of the SOM are necessary to identify land degradation (Pulido et al. 2017; Dumanski and Pieri 2000).

These indicators might be used as a&#160;set of site-dependent indicators, and in a&#160;plant-soil system (Ehrenfeld et al. 2005).</span></div></body></html>
