<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0090">In 2007/08, the world experienced a major food crisis which saw a drastic rise in global food prices. It is reported that women were among the hardest hit by the crisis (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Botreau and Cohen, 2020</xref>). Accordingly, in the year following the crisis (2009), &#8216;women and girls accounted for 60% of chronically hungry people around the world&#8217; (<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Oxfam, 2019</xref>). The dramatic rise in food prices affected women both as food producers by increasing the cost of production which in turn reduced food availability, and as consumers and home food managers - by weakening consumer purchasing power (<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Oxfam, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal, 2011</xref>). Literature indicates that rural households spend a higher proportion of their income on food, they lack credit and savings, and they don't have social protection systems to fall back on (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Compton et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it has been found that even in the context where smallholders (women therein) experience an increase in income, due to impoverished positions, a better food intake is not guaranteed given competing non-food needs (<xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Wangu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Wangu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">van Westen et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
