(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>) contain expanded interpretations of GPGs. They argue that a globalized world with both goods and bads, demands a new understanding of GPGs, different from the neoclassical, national territory-bounded framing. Kaul et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1999</xref>: 16) defined GPGs as &#8220;goods whose benefits are strongly universal in terms of countries (i.e., covering more than one group of countries), people (i.e., accruing to several, preferably all, population groups), and generations &#8230;&#8221; Further, they classified GPGs into three groups (p.453): (a) global natural commons, such as high seas and the atmosphere; (b) global human-made commons, such as global networks, knowledge, and international regimes; and (c) global policy outcomes and conditions, such as peace, security, and financial stability. Thus, restored climate stability, the increased number of knowledge networks, multi-disciplinary IPCC science, adaptation actions benefitting the majority of countries and populations, which contribute to poverty reduction, resilient development and peace building fully qualify as GPGs. Magnan and Ribera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>) view adaptation as a GPG, as climate change has potential to displace peoples or create new global public health challenges, and these can only be addressed through international cooperation.</p>
