Reanalyses are also noted to significantly underestimate the Saharan warming (Zhou and Wang, 2016). Saharan warming causes a&#160;stronger thermal low and more intense monsoon flow, providing more moisture to the central and eastern Sahel, supported by CMIP5 models (Lavaysse et&#160;al., 2016), although not all models capture the observed rainfall&#8211;heat&#8211;low relationship. Sahel rainfall is also incorrectly located in prototype versions of a&#160;few CMIP6 models, related to tropospheric temperature biases (Martin et&#160;al., 2017). Amplified Saharan warming has increased the wind shear, leading to a&#160;tripling of extreme storms since 1982, which may partially explain the recovery (Taylor et&#160;al., 2017). Instead, observations, multiple models and SST-sensitivity experiments with AGCMs have suggested that stronger Mediterranean Sea evaporation enhances low-level moisture convergence to the Sahel, increasing rainfall (Park et&#160;al., 2016). Meanwhile, an AGCM study suggested that GHGs alone (in the absence of SST warming) could cause Sahel rainfall recovery, with an additional role for anthropogenic aerosol (Dong and Sutton, 2015); recent changes in North Atlantic SSTs, although substantial, did not exert a&#160;significant impact on the recovery. Large spread in the recovery in a&#160;five-member AGCM ensemble suggests that atmospheric internal variability cannot be discounted (Roehrig et&#160;al., 2013).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="306.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="306.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.84; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Consistent timing of the southward ITCZ shift during the decline period in CMIP3 and CMIP5 historical simulations supports the role of external forcing, chiefly anthropogenic aerosol (Hwang et&#160;al., 2013). The evolution of the observed decline and recovery is largely followed by the CMIP5 multi-model mean, further supporting the role of external drivers (Giannini and Kaplan, 2019). Updated results from CMIP6 for historical simulations with all and single forcings are represented in Figure&#160;10.11d,e showing smaller trends than those observed. Giannini and Kaplan (2019) attempted to unify the driving mechanisms for decline and recovery based on singular-value decomposition of observed and modelled SSTs. Since the 1950s, tropical warming arising from GHGs and North Atlantic cooling from aerosol led to regional stabilization, suppressing Sahel rainfall. The subsequent reduction in aerosol emissions then led to North Atlantic warming and recovery of Sahel rainfall. Such mechanisms continue into the near-term future in idealized and modified RCP experiments, with scenarios featuring more aggressive reductions in aerosol emissions, or including aerosol&#8211;cloud interactions, favouring a&#160;greater northward shift of rainfall (Allen, 2015; Westervelt et&#160;al., 2017, 2018; Scannell et&#160;al., 2019). There is paleoclimate evidence of changes to Sahel rainfall in the past, in particular with enhancement of the West African monsoon during the mid-Holocene.

Zhang et&#160;al., 2016; D&#237;az and Vera, 2017; Saurral et&#160;al., 2017). Sedimentary records from the Mar Chiquita lake indicate that the last quarter of the 20th&#160;century was wetter than any period during the last 200&#160;years (Piovano et&#160;al., 2004). In this attribution example the drivers contributing to the positive trend for the period 1951&#8211;2014 are discussed (Figure&#160;10.12a). Precipitation anomalies of Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) as well as for the two members of a&#160;SMILE with the most negative and positive trends for 1951&#8211;2014 are displayed in Figure&#160;10.12b. The trend for 1951&#8211;2014 using CRU TS and GPCC is illustrated in Figure&#160;10.12c, and for the region defined by the black quadrilateral, it amounts to 2.8 (CRU TS)&#160;&#8211; 3.5 (GPCC)&#160;mm per month and decade (see black crosses in Figure&#160;10.12d) while the mean summer monthly precipitation for the same period is 104&#160;(CRU TS) &#8211;109 (GPCC)&#160;mm. The trend is also detectable in daily and monthly extremes (Re and Barros, 2009; Marengo et&#160;al., 2010; Penalba and Robledo, 2010; Doyle et&#160;al., 2012; Donat et&#160;al., 2013; Lorenz et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.28" top="222.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="222.6" x1="557.28" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 222.6; y1: 232.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The influence of SST anomalies on south-eastern South America precipitation have been studied extensively on interannual to multi-decadal time scales (Paegle and Mo, 2002). The positive phase of El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Annex IV.2.3) is related to stronger mean and extreme rainfall over south-eastern South America (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Grimm and Tedeschi, 2009; Robledo et&#160;al., 2016). The ENSO influence may be modulated by the PDV (Kayano and Andreoli, 2007; Fernandes and Rodrigues, 2018) and the AMV (Kayano and Capistrano, 2014). PDV and AMV also influence the south-eastern South American climate independently of ENSO (Barreiro et&#160;al., 2014; Grimm and Saboia, 2015; Robledo et&#160;al., 2020). While Pacific SSTs dominate the overall influence of oceanic variability in the region, the Atlantic variability seems to&#160;dominate on multi-decadal time scales and has been proposed as a&#160;driver for the long-term positive trend (Seager et&#160;al., 2010; </span></div></body></html>
