Nye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>) suggests that while the USA led in production of GPGs since WWII, now, cooperation of other powerful states is needed, because power has become a positive-sum game for achieving global goals. The GCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>) strongly urges all countries to initiate three revolutions: (a) a revolution in understanding of climate risks, making them visible; (b) a revolution in planning based on long term vision; and (c) a revolution in financing for adaptation. For all these revolutions to happen, a new kind of cooperative arrangement is needed, where the proposed norm of adaptation as a GPG can be the organizing principle.</p>
