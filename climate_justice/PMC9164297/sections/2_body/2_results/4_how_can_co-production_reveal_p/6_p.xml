<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0100">Empowerment in marginalized communities in developing countries, fostered by strengthened social relationships and knowledge sharing, could also potentially increase the use of climate information services (CIS), which again bolster food security (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">McKune et al., 2018</xref>). In a project in rural communities in Senegal and Kenya, researchers made an effort to better understand access to and uptake of CIS. The project revealed that while men control decision making on food storage, women consider this issue more important than men. Women have the responsibility of using the storage more often and adapting it for new types of use, revealing how gendered discrepancies were embedded within the social structures of these agrarian communities (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">McKune et al., 2018</xref>). Here, empowerment refers to access to frequent and good information, but also to social connectedness with the potential for training and exchange. This example also highlights social structures where power asymmetries must be understood to facilitate usable adaptation knowledge.</p>
