<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate justice is a concept that aims to understand the unequal burden of the effects of climate change on health [<xref rid="B96-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="B101-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. It is, therefore, intimately linked with social inequalities in health and the approach to this problem, since it reveals how the most socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are those with the highest risk of suffering from adverse health effects due to climate change. In this regard, climate justice seeks to ensure that mitigation and adaptation policies generate co-benefits for the most disadvantaged populations with the aim of not widening social inequalities even more [<xref rid="B102-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Definitions of climate justice vary, but the concept has three outstanding features: (1) it recognizes the imbalance between responsibilities and harms; (2) it defends the need to implement policies and interventions to correct these imbalances; and (3) it highlights the importance of these policies and interventions to promote human rights, help empower the population and to foster community alliances and self-sufficiency in order to improve the population&#8217;s health and wellbeing [<xref rid="B103-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p>
