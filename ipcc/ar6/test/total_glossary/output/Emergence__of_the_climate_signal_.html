<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Emergence of a <em>climate change</em> signal or trend refers to when a change in <em>climate</em> (the ‘signal’) becomes larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining the ‘noise’), This concept is often expressed as a ‘signal-to-noise’ ratio and emergence occurs at a defined threshold of this ratio (e.g., S/N &gt; 1 or 2). Emergence can refer to changes relative to a historical or modern baseline (usually at least 20 years long) and can also be expressed in terms of time (<em>time of emergence</em>) or in terms of a global warming level. Emergence is also used to refer to a time when we can expect to see a response to reducing <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions (emergence with respect to <em>mitigation</em>). Emergence can be estimated using observations and/or model simulations.</p></dd>
