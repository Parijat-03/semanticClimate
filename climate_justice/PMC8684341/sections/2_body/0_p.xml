We cannot read every book, so we need to know where to spend the time and effort. There is an element of sorting&#8212;or curation&#8212;that we get from book reviews. Where does the book fit in the literature? What is it saying that is different from other books? For people who write on the same topic, the point about reviews is to know what is going on elsewhere. How does this book connect with your own work? How is it distinguishable from your own work? But reading reviews of your own book is a daunting prospect. It is hard to even begin to read them. They can go either way. If we are honest, vanity is the main reason authors eventually get around to reading reviews of their own work. Yet, perhaps the most important function of book reviews is not &#8220;curation&#8221; or &#8220;vanity,&#8221; it is that they represent the antithesis in the Hegelian dialectic. Book reviews are a good way to develop the critical, dissenting and opposing positions that allow us to reach a synthesis of ideas. If the arguments set out in books are not discussed and reflected on, they remain in a kind of paralysis, fixed in the time they were written. Book reviews allow the ideas and arguments contained within the book to be discarded or picked up in a different form; they allow the book to move on, or move aside, for the next set of ideas and arguments. I will try to move my book on&#8212;to bring it out of its fixed state&#8212;by surveying and responding to the criticisms set forth in the five reviews in this issue.</p>
