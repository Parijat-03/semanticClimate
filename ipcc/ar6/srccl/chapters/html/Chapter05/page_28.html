Contaminated water and diarrheal diseases are acute threats to food security (Bond et al. 2018). Whilst there is little direct evidence (in terms of modelled projections) the results of a&#160;range of reviews, as well as expert groups, suggest that risks from foodborne pathogens are likely to increase through multiple mechanisms (Tirado et al. 2010; van der Spiegel et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013; Kirezieva et al. 2015; Hellberg and Chu 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="639.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 639.12; y1: 648.62; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="639.12" x1="307.55">An additional route to climate change impacts on human health can arise from the changing biology of plants altering human exposure levels.

Changing these processes can change growth rates, and therefore yields, but can also cause organisms to change relative investments in growth vs reproduction, and therefore change the nutrients assimilated. This may decrease protein and mineral nutrient concentrations, as well as alter lipid composition (DaMatta et al. 2010). For example, apples in Japan have been exposed to higher temperatures over&#160;3&#8211;4 decades and have responded by blooming earlier. This has led to changes in acidity, firmness, and water content, reducing quality (Sugiura et al. 2013). In other fruit, such as grapes, warming-induced changes in sugar composition affect both colour and aroma (Mira de Ordu&#241;a 2010). Changing heat stress in poultry can affect yield as well as meat quality (by altering fat deposition and chemical constituents), shell quality of eggs,&#160;and immune systems (Lara and Rostagno 2013). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="399.9" top="735.13"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.8; y0: 735.13; y1: 744.63; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="735.13" x1="399.9">Effects of rising CO</span><span style="x0: 399.9; x1: 403.36; y0: 734.92; y1: 741.57; width: 3.46; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="399.9" y0="734.92" x1="403.36">2</span><span style="x0: 407.66; x1: 411.7; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="407.66" y0="735.11" x1="470.91">concentrations. </span><span style="x0: 472.6; x1: 477.7; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="472.6" y0="735.11" x1="566.08">Climate change is being driven by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other GHG&#8217;s in the atmosphere.
