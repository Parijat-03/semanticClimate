A total of 30 CWT members and 9 Review Editors were selected and accepted by the IPCC Bureau at its 58th Session on 19 May 2020. In the process of developing the SYR, 7 Extended Writing Team (EWT) authors were selected by the CWT and approved by the Chair and the IPCC Bureau, and 28 Contributing Authors were selected by the CWT with the approval of the Chair. These additional authors were to enhance and deepen the expertise required for the preparation of the Report. The Chair established at the 58th Session of the Bureau an SYR Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) with a mandate to advise the development of the SYR. The SYR SSC comprised the members of the IPCC Bureau, excluding those members who served as Review Editors for the SYR.</span></div><div left="39.69" right="296.56" top="425.41"><span style="x0: 39.69; x1: 45.14; y0: 425.41; y1: 434.91; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="39.69" y0="425.41" x1="296.56">Due to the covid pandemic, the first two meetings of the CWT were held virtually from 25 to 29 January 2021 and from 16 to 20 August 2021. The First Order Draft (FOD) was released to experts and governments for review on 10 January 2022 with comments due on 20 March 2022. The CWT met in Dublin from 25 to 28 March 2022 to discuss how best to revise the FOD to address the more than 10,000 comments received. The Review Editors monitored the review process to ensure that all comments received appropriate consideration. The IPCC circulated a final draft of the Summary for Policymakers and a longer report of the SYR to governments for review from 21 November 2022 to 15 January 2023 which resulted in over 6,000 comments. A final SYR draft for approval incorporating the comments from the final government distribution was submitted to the IPCC member governments on 8 March 2023.</span></div><div left="39.69" right="296.63" top="229.2"><span style="x0: 39.69; x1: 43.9; y0: 229.2; y1: 238.7; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="39.69" y0="229.2" x1="296.63">The Panel at its 58th Session, held from 13 to 17 March 2023 in Interlaken, Switzerland, approved the SPM line by line and adopted the longer report section by section. </span></div><div left="39.69" right="138.37" top="142.16"><span style="x0: 39.69; x1: 47.02; y0: 142.16; y1: 154.16; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AAAABF+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="39.69" y0="142.16" x1="138.37">Acknowledgements</span></div><div left="39.69" right="296.59" top="112.98"><span style="x0: 39.69; x1: 43.9; y0: 112.98; y1: 122.48; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BKSOJG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="39.69" y0="112.98" x1="296.59">The SYR was made possible thanks to the hard work and commitment to excellence shown by the Section Facilitators, members of CWT and EWT, and Contributing Authors.
