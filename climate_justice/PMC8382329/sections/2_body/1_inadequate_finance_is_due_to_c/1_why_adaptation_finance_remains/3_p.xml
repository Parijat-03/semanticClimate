Unlike in mitigation, there are no measurable indicators or offset benefits from adaptation. As indicated, the conventional conceptualization looks at adaptation as local, national, or at best as a regional public good (Tigre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2019</xref>). However, the private sector is active in promoting renewable energy both in developed and developing countries, which brings in mostly mitigation benefits and avoided fossil fuel energy costs, but decentralized renewable energy systems also have adaptation benefits. As mitigation anywhere brings in direct global benefits, there is a significant bias for supporting it by public, private, multilateral funding, and even by NGOs in developing countries (OECD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>; Chan and Amling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>).</p>
