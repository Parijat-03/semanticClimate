The paper builds upon evidence from AR5 (Wong et&#160;al., 2014), the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; Magnan et&#160;al., 2019; Oppenheimer et&#160;al., 2019) and draws material from across WGII AR6 (especially Chapters 3, 6, 9&#8211;15). It differs from the SLR-focused analysis of urban areas in SROCC (Section&#160;4.3) through a more integrated assessment that distinguishes between archetypal coastal C&amp;S (Section CCP2.1.2), sectoral risks to C&amp;S by the sea (Section CCP2.2), responses to address these risks (Section CCP2.3) and enabling conditions and lessons learned (Section CCP2.4).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.74" top="510.62"><span x0="54.0" y0="510.62" x1="307.74" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 61.56; y0: 510.62; y1: 520.12; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">We define C&amp;S as concentrated human habitation centres, whether small or large, rural or urban (Section&#160;6.1.3). We highlight the unique exposure and vulnerability of coastal C&amp;S resulting from rapid urbanisation at the narrow land&#8211;sea interface, and a high concentration of economic activity and at-risk people, many with long-standing cultural ties to the coast and dependence on coastal ecosystems that are prone to climate change impacts (</span><span style="x0: 187.65; x1: 192.22; y0: 438.63; y1: 448.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: DGKZFC+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="187.65" y0="438.63" x1="244.24">high confidence</span><span x0="244.24" y0="438.63" x1="307.7" style="x0: 244.24; x1: 246.52; y0: 438.63; y1: 448.13; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">; He and Silliman, 2019; Lau et&#160;al., 2019; Oppenheimer et&#160;al., 2019; Sterzel et&#160;al., 2020)</span><span style="x0: 299.89; x1: 302.17; y0: 426.63; y1: 436.13; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: DGKZFC+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="299.89" y0="426.63" x1="302.17">.</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.74" top="402.63"><span x0="54.0" y0="402.63" x1="307.74" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.57; y0: 402.63; y1: 412.13; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Presently, the coastal C&amp;S population exposure to ocean-driven impacts from SLR and other climate-driven impacts is considerable by any measure (Buddemeier et&#160;al., 2008; Barrag&#225;n and de Andr&#233;s, 2015; Kay and Alder, 2017; Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2019; McMichael et&#160;al., 2020; Sterzel et&#160;al., 2020). In 2020, almost 11% of the global population&#8212;896&#160;million people&#8212;resided in C&amp;S within the low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ; coastal areas below 10 m of elevation above sea level that are hydrologically connected to the sea; Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2021b), a figure which will potentially increase beyond 1&#160;billion by 2050 (Oppenheimer et&#160;al., 2019). Infrastructural and economic assets worth USD&#160;6,500&#8211;11,000&#160;billion are also exposed in the 1-in-100-year floodplain for C&amp;S of all sizes (Neumann et&#160;al., 2015; Muis et&#160;al., 2016; Brown et&#160;al., 2018; Andrew et&#160;al., 2019; Kulp and Strauss, 2019; Kirezci et&#160;al., 2020; Thomas et&#160;al., 2020; Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2021b; Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.75" top="210.66"><span x0="54.0" y0="210.66" x1="307.75" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.05; y0: 210.66; y1: 220.16; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Further, coastal cities located at higher elevations (e.g., S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) or distantly located inland along tidally influenced rivers (e.g., the Recife Metropolitan Region, Brazil) also have populations and infrastructure exposed to climate impacts. As such, the inclusion of C&amp;S beyond the LECZ is warranted when assessing climate impacts and associated exposure, vulnerabilities and risks. The coastal zone includes some of the world&#8217;s largest, most densely populated megacities, as well as the fastest-growing urban areas. However, vast coastal areas are sparsely populated, with populations in these regions concentrated in smaller C&amp;S, including along subsiding shorelines and in deltas (Nicholls and Small, 2002; McGranahan et&#160;al., 2007; Merkens et&#160;al., 2018; Edmonds et&#160;al., 2020; Nicholls et&#160;al., 2021). From this wider perspective, climate change impacts on the coast directly or indirectly affect a large portion of the global population, economic activity </span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.89" top="714.68"><span x0="318.19" y0="714.68" x1="571.89" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.75; y0: 714.68; y1: 724.18; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">23&#8211;37% of the global population lives within 100 km of the shoreline (Nicholls and Small, 2002; Shi and Singh, 2003; Christopher&#160;Small and Joel&#160;E.&#160;Cohen, 2004; McMichael et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.94" top="666.69"><span x0="318.19" y0="666.69" x1="571.94" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.29; y0: 666.69; y1: 676.19; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">C&amp;S by the sea are thus on the frontline of action to adapt to climate change, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and chart CRD pathways for several distinct reasons. First, home to a concentrated (and growing) portion of the world&#8217;s population, many coastal C&amp;S are simultaneously exposed and vulnerable to climate-compounded hazards as well as being centres of creativity and innovation (Glavovic, 2013; Crescenzi and Rodr&#237;guez-Pose, 2017; Druzhinin et&#160;al., 2021; Mariano et&#160;al., 2021; Storbj&#246;rk and Hjerpe, 2021). Second, people in C&amp;S by the sea rely on coastal ecosystems, many of which are highly sensitive to climate change impacts that compound non-climatic risks and increase the precarity of coastal livelihoods (Lu et&#160;al., 2018; He and Silliman, 2019; Thrush et&#160;al., 2021). Third, coastal C&amp;S are linked together through a network of ports and harbours that underpin global trade and exchange, but which are prone to climate change impacts, especially SLR, with significant implications for global CRD prospects (Becker et&#160;al., 2018; Christodoulou et&#160;al., 2019; Walsh et&#160;al., 2019; Hanson and Nicholls, 2020). For these reasons, this paper assesses responses, enabling conditions and lessons learned for addressing climate change in C&amp;S by the sea.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="560.99" top="414.48"><span style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.75; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: QIIWJC+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.19" y0="414.48" x1="560.99">CCP2.1.2 Urbanisation in Coastal Systems: Coastal City and Settlement Archetypes</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.89" top="378.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="378.6" x1="571.89" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.41; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">This assessment uses an archetype framework categorizing coastal C&amp;S according to geomorphological characteristics, urban growth, economic resources and inequalities (Figure&#160;CCP2.1). Three broadly defined coastal settlement geomorphologies are used in each row: open coasts (a coast with sediment without river mouths) and two transitional coastal zones with river mouths, distinguishing between estuaries (a wetland receiving sediment from both fluvial and marine sources, which is affected by tide, wave and river processes) and deltas (a wetland where fluvial sediment is supplied and deposited more rapidly than it can be redistributed by basin processes such as waves and tides; Bhattacharya, 1978; Barrag&#225;n and de Andr&#233;s, 2015; Kay and Alder, 2017; Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2019; Sterzel et&#160;al., 2020). Small island C&amp;S are not singled out in this typology, because their coastlines often include the geomorphic features listed above, or require a different adaptation approach at larger spatial scales (Haasnoot et&#160;al., 2019). Several coastal C&amp;S have a combination of two typologies, for example, Maputo-Matola, Mozambique and Mumbai, India, having both open and transitional riverine coasts, and can be classed as mixed. We also acknowledge that several coastal C&amp;S may have areas sited in mountainous topography that abruptly rises from the coast (e.g., along the Mediterranean), but generally these cities have narrow, densely populated coastlines exhibiting these three archetypal categories (Blackburn et&#160;al., 2019). Arctic settlements are addressed separately in this cross-chapter paper.</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.92" top="78.64"><span x0="318.19" y0="78.64" x1="571.92" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.29; y0: 78.64; y1: 88.14; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Coastal C&amp;S within these geomorphological categories are further distinguished according to higher or lower rates of urban growth and inequality, which can be estimated through population growth </span></div></body></html>
