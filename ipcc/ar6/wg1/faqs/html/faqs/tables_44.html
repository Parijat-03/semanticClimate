      <td>For a given future scenario, climate models project a range of changes in global surface temperature. This range\nis closely related to equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS, which measures how climate models respond to\na doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Models with high climate sensitivity project stronger future\nwarming. Some climate models of the new generation are more sensitive than the range assessed in the IPCC\nSixth Assessment Report. This leads to end-of-century global warming in some simulations of up to 2&#176;C&#8211;3&#176;C\nabove the current IPCC best estimate.
