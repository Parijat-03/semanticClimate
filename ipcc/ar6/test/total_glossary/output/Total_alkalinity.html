However, its value is not affected by the exchange of carbon dioxide gas between seawater and the atmosphere. Measurements of total alkalinity can thus be used to help study these biogeochemical processes and can also be used to help calculate the state of the seawater acid–base system. Total alkalinity is most commonly measured using an acidimetric titration technique that determines how much acid is required to titrate a seawater sample to a specified equivalence point.</p></div></dd><div>
