Faced with rising hunger and food riots that peaked in 2007&#8211;2008, and the lack of past effectiveness in attempts to shape regional-global responses, CFS Member States (MSs) agreed in 2009 to an ambitious reform programme for the CFS, giving it a new vision, role and structure. The food sovereignty movement played a significant role in both, the decision to reform the CFS, as well as the shape it took, acting through the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC), a platform of small-scale food producers&#8217; organizations, social movements and support NGOs formed to interface with the global food agencies (McKeon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>). The new CFS aimed to be &#8216;the foremost inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for all human beings&#8217;. And further, &#8216;The CFS will strive for a world free from hunger where countries implement the voluntary guidelines for the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security&#8217;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref></p>
