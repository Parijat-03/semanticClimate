For elevation changes and 8 geodetic mass-balance estimates, a number of new or recently made available data sources are used. This 9 includes archived aerial photographs; declassified satellite photoreconnaissance missions from the 1960&#8211;10 1984 period; Hexagon KH-9 Mapping Camera images (e.g. Bindschadler and Vornberger, 1998; Surazakov 11 and Aizen, 2010); optical stereo-imagery that includes ASTER (Raup et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2017), SPOT 12 (Zheng et al., 2018), CryoSat2 (Foresta et al., 2018), High-Resolution SAR Interferometry, like TanDEM-X 13 (Krieger et al., 2007; Braun et al., 2019); and high-resolution digital elevation models with submeter 14 uncertainty from Lidar, Pleiades (Berthier et al., 2014), Worldview (Shean et al., 2016) and Arctic DEM 15 (Porter et al., 2018). This is a breakthrough in both spatial and temporal resolution that will revolutionize 16 monitoring of glaciers in the coming years. Increase in computational power and the use of large-scale batch 17 processing, like the Ames Stereo Pipeline (Shean et al., 2016), are allowing for the assessment of glacier 18 elevation changes at continental or large mountain range scales (Brun et al., 2017; Braun et al., 2019). 19 20 21 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 507.11; y1: 518.09; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="507.11" x1="287.84">Atlas.5.10.2.2 Glacier volume thus sea level change </span><span x0="27.66" y0="507.11" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 507.11; y1: 518.09; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">22 To estimate the total volume and thus the sea-level equivalent mass of the glaciers in the Arctic and globally, 23 the thickness of all the glaciers needs to be known. A standardised database of glacier thickness (GlaThiDa, 24 containing observations from roughly 1,100 glaciers, (G&#228;rtner-Roer et al., 2014; GlaThiDa Consortium, 25 2019) is used to validate the global estimation approaches which come with large uncertainties (median 26 relative absolute deviation of around 30%) and a tendency to overestimate the glacier thickness. Since AR5, 27 a coordinated effort to assess the quality of glacier thickness estimates has been made in the framework of 28 the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison Experiment (ITMIX; Farinotti et al., 2017). Only a few models 29 are currently capable of operating on an Arctic and global scale, and the differences in the results of the 17 30 models assessed in ITMIX highlight the importance for an internationally consistent database against which 31 models can be calibrated and validated (Farinotti et al., 2017). A consensus estimate of world&#8217;s glaciers 32 thicknesses made from five models of variable spatial extent  (Huss and Farinotti, 2012; Frey et al., 2014; 33 F&#252;rst et al., 2017; Ramsankaran et al., 2018; Maussion et al., 2019) indicates that there still remains a large 34 uncertainty in the estimated thickness and subsequent sea-level contribution, due to both model uncertainty 35 and input data (Farinotti et al., 2019). This new estimate of the thickness of all glaciers in the Arctic and the 36 world and thereby their volume is presented in Chapter 9.  37 38 The continued synthesis of ever-longer time series from multi-platform observations and combined datasets 39 is rapidly improving understanding of the present and past cryosphere. Focusing on the Earth&#8217;s ice masses, 40 including glaciers in the Arctic, several studies (e.g., Bamber et al., 2018; Box et al., 2018; Shepherd et al., 41 2018, 2019; Zemp et al., 2019) integrate and assess estimates from gravity, altimetry and mass change 42 measurements. These new syntheses are able to reduce uncertainties and provide clearer insights into 43 interannual and decadal trends. 44 45 46 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 189.89; y1: 200.87; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="189.89" x1="407.39">Atlas.5.10.2.3 Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution </span><span x0="27.66" y0="189.89" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 189.89; y1: 200.87; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">47 While temperatures in the Arctic have warmed considerably, datasets show that Greenland, as well as the 48 ocean south of it, have cooled over the last 15 years (Susskind et al., 2019). This cooling over Greenland is a 49 relatively recent phenomenon. However, McGrath et al. (2013) showed that previous in situ measurements at 50 Greenland Summit suggested that the annual mean near-surface air temperature had increased by 0.9 &#177; 0.1 51 &#176;C per decade from 1982 to 2011. The long-term weather data over west Greenland show that since 1994 52 mean June air temperatures are 2.2&#176;C higher and mean winter precipitation has doubled from 21 to 40 mm; 53 and since 2006, mean July air temperatures are 1.1&#176;C higher (Saros et al., 2019). 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
