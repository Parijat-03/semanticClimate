This definition captures the fact that the CCM is a highly diverse and loosely connected field of actors, which has over time been internally divided over conflicts regarding, among others, reformism and radicalism (Saunders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2012</xref>), climate justice (Hadden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>) and the movement&#8217;s relation to governments (de Moor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2018</xref>). It is thus arguably preferable to refer to CCMs in plural, and it is only possible to assess the potential contribution of part of the CCM within the scope of this paper. By studying the FFF campaign in Australia, Europe and the USA, this paper focuses on a CCM based in the global North and a part of the movement that has been depicted as politically and strategically moderate (Marquardt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; de Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020b</xref>; Buzog&#225;ny and Scherhaufer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2022</xref>). References to climate activism below are made with this focus in mind. Nonetheless, especially during its largest global campaigns, such as the one covered here, FFF mobilized protesters who reflected the movement&#8217;s strategic and political broadness (de Moor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020b</xref>).</p>
