<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">An existing framework with relevance for a post-COVID-19 world is One Welfare, which builds on the more widely known One Health concept. As described in the <italic toggle="yes">Animals&#8217; Manifesto: Preventing COVID-X</italic>, published in December 2020, &#8220;One Welfare further eliminates silos by recognizing that linkages between human wellbeing, animal welfare and the environment affect more than just health, and indeed impact issues as diverse as food security, food safety, livelihoods, climate change, and biodiversity.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> While not specifically rights oriented, by spanning disciplines that still often don&#8217;t work together, One Welfare offers some guidance for envisioning more rights-based strategies as well.</p>
