Reflecting the 1998 Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, framework principle 4 notes, &#8220;States should provide a safe and enabling environment in which individuals, groups and organs of society that work on human rights or environmental issues can operate free from threats, harassment, intimidation and violence.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Civic space also implies access to public space&#8212;both physical, in print and online&#8212;in which to debate, demonstrate, and hold states to account.</p>
