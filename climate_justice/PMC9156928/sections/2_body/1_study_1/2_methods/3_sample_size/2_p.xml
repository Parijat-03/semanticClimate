<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We calculated the required sample based on an effect size of <italic toggle="yes">f</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.15 for the regression analysis of hypothesis H3 (see below). This smallest effect size of interest was determined by aggregating across the literature of the 11 psychological factors. The R package <italic toggle="yes">pwr</italic> was used to perform a power analysis for a linear regression with alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95, effect size <italic toggle="yes">f</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.15 and numerator d.f. = 5. This power analysis yielded <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 143. Based on our earlier experience recruiting student activists through classes and educational materials, we anticipated 30% of participants would join at least one activism event, and half of these participants would develop an enduring commitment. Further, we expected about 10% of participants to drop out during the study. Therefore, we planned to recruit <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 160 for the main experimental group.</p>
