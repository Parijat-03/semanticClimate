<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par18">Nussbaum admits that the CA does not provide a complete account of social justice and that it is &#8216;an account of minimum core social entitlements&#8217; (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 75). Holland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>) has developed a framework that supplements capability thresholds with ceilings. Capability ceilings &#8216;establish maximum levels on the protection and provision of capabilities that can cause harm to others&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 142); namely, they &#8216;impose a limit on the set of basic opportunities available to people&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>). Capability ceilings establish maximum levels and are thus a supplement to capability thresholds, which establish the minimum levels. Accordingly, ceilings impose restrictions as they &#8216;make people unable to do certain things&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 142). A ceiling on capabilities also means a ceiling on functionings, as it constrains what functionings someone can achieve. Because CA emphasizes having freedom of choice, a ceiling on capabilities rather than on functionings is more in line with the approach as a whole.</p>
