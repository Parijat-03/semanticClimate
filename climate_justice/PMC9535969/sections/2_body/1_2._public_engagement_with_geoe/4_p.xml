(2017)</xref>, who organized FGs with 136 participants from Japan, New Zealand, the United States and Sweden, noted that common themes emerged across them all. This is usually the case for technologies like geoengineering because people tend to use similar mind schemes to make sense of novel and emerging technologies, which are not yet subject to entrenched social representations (<xref rid="bibr26-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Rogers-Hayden and Pidgeon, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Wibeck et al., 2017</xref>). Participants often craft their perceptions of geoengineering according to its perceived degree of controllability, although controllability itself is multi-faceted (<xref rid="bibr5-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Bellamy et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
