Although previous studies have found limited evidence of clear relationships between city characteristics and their degree of focus on justice in climate mitigation and adaptation planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we find that several local factors may increase the likelihood of cities incorporating justice into their climate action plans. First, cities with a higher median household income and cities with higher levels of poverty have increased odds of incorporating justice into their climate plans. This suggests that cities with more economic inequities (i.e., high incomes and high poverty rates) are paying more attention to justice. Similar to Hess and Mckane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we find no evidence that higher population diversity positively impacts cities&#8217; level of engagement with justice. However, our model supports the finding by Liao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> that public engagement in climate planning is associated with greater attention to justice. We also find that cities with larger populations are more likely to have higher levels of engagement with justice. This may be due to the higher capacities of large cities to undertake more complex planning efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, but it might also reflect broader trends of big cities increasingly creating climate action plans in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Finally, we find that coastal cities have increased odds of engaging with justice, while legacy cities (i.e., post-industrial cities) have decreased odds. This could be explained by cities&#8217; differential levels of vulnerability to climate change and governance capacities. Case studies in these different types of geographies could help understand and disentangle the complex dynamics of climate action and justice planning in these contexts.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Local factors and climate plan characteristics and their effect on cities&#8217; level of engagement with justice in climate action planning</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Variable</th><th rowspan="2">Variable Description</th><th colspan="5">Regression Results</th></tr><tr><th>Coefficients</th><th>Standard Error</th><th><italic>Z</italic> value</th><th><italic>P</italic>-value</th><th>Odds Ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>After 2017</td><td>Climate plan published after 2017</td><td>2.3984</td><td>0.7317</td><td>3.278</td><td>0.0010 **</td><td>11.0053</td></tr><tr><td>Population</td><td>City population &gt; 500,000</td><td>1.4528</td><td>0.6446</td><td>2.254</td><td>0.0242 *</td><td>4.2749</td></tr><tr><td>Median household income (MHI)</td><td>MHI&#8201;&gt;&#8201;sample mean ($61,532)</td><td>3.2287</td><td>1.0585</td><td>3.050</td><td>0.0023 **</td><td>25.2472</td></tr><tr><td>Poverty</td><td>Percentage of persons in poverty, 2019</td><td>0.3997</td><td>0.1176</td><td>3.399</td><td>0.0007 ***</td><td>1.4914</td></tr><tr><td>People of colour</td><td>Percentage of population who did not identify as &#8220;White alone, not Hispanic or Latino&#8221;&#160;in the US Census.
