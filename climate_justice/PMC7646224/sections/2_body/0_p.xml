In 2019, as the presidential primary kicked off, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said that the Democratic Party would not host a debate centered on climate change, reasoning that it would be unfair to host a debate on a &#8216;single issue&#8217;. Similarly, climate solutions that go beyond the scope of simple decarbonization face stark criticism from both the left and right. In 2019, the <italic>New York Times</italic> editorial board questioned<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> whether addressing the climate crisis was &#8216;merely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?&#8217; Soon after, the <italic>Washington Post</italic> editorial board asserted<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> that policymakers should not &#8216;muddle&#8217; decarbonization with social programmes that &#8216;divert money and attention from the primary mission&#8217;.</p>
