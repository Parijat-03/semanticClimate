<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0140">Different implications of pervasive technological change can be considered in models, including negative effects and ways to mitigate them <xref rid="b0800" ref-type="bibr">[160]</xref>. These could encompass overall rebound effects linked with the emergence of new energy-expensive services and improved efficiency in digitalisation and future convergence of currently individual services, considering recent past trends, such as data transfer, search engine innovations, streaming needs, cryptocurrency and associated computing demands <xref rid="b0805" ref-type="bibr">[161]</xref>. They can also encompass a broader consideration of emerging social trends, such as the increased substitution of artificial intelligence and robotics for labour, or mega-trends emerging from movements (with implications) for climate action, like flight-shaming (&#8216;flygskam&#8217;), train bragging (&#8216;t&#229;gskryt&#8217;) and vegan lifestyles (&#8216;Veganuary&#8217;) <xref rid="b0810" ref-type="bibr">[162]</xref>. Such considerations, along with their positive and negative effects <xref rid="b0815" ref-type="bibr">[163]</xref>, including the arguments regarding individualisation of responsibility <xref rid="b0820" ref-type="bibr">[164]</xref> can affect the employed modelling approaches and scenario building, so that digital capacity and accumulation of human and social capital be considered, and pervasive uncertainties be represented in the scenarios, building upon and augmenting the standardised energy demand, intensity assumptions and flexibility of the SSP framework.</p>
