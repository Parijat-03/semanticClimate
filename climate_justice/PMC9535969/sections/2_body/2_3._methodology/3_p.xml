Hence, the FGs were designed not as an attempt to represent a &#8216;broader public&#8217; but rather to politicize the discussion. Group VI was thought of as a &#8216;control group&#8217;, meant to test our argument, allowing us to reflect on the merits and limitations of our research design. Our research was informed by <xref rid="bibr5-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Bellamy et al.&#8217;s (2017)</xref> experimental approach, which attempted to develop alternatives to mainstream forms of deliberation. By engaging situated publics, we explicitly attempted to bring to the fore concerns directly linked to the situatedness of each group: climate and environmental justice (Group I); intergenerational justice (Group II); social justice (Group III); science, technology and democracy (Group IV) and deep ecology (Group V).</p>
