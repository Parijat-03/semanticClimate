Pigs are sold (88.7% of cases) when the household has many but are most valued as payment for agricultural labor groups. Goats (37.7%) are also raised for selling, but chickens are only sold when people have a pressing need (50.9%). The reception of remittances sent by urban migrants is significantly related to the age of the head of the household (p-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). However, only a small number of households (18.9%) receive remittances and, for most of them, this form of help is merely sent at critical moments (such as illness, lack of rice, and, more frequently, during the rainy season, when they need money to hire labor groups). Indeed, those that migrate to study must also work (women as maids and babysitters and men usually as night guards) to pay for their needs, but salaries are usually low.</p>
