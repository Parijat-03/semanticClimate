This is where we have to keep separate the science of collapse from the doomsday prophecies of religious apocalypticism lest the two become unnecessarily and unhelpfully commingled. The focus of collapsology is first and foremost on what is fast becoming runaway climate change and runaway loss of biodiversity and how geopolitical conflict, economic inequality, and social unrest and racial discord are making the crisis that much worse. &#8220;Can the conjunction and perpetuation of &#8216;crises&#8217; actually drag our civilization into an inescapable whirlpool?&#8221; Servigne and Stevens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>) ask. &#8220;How far can all this go?&#8221; (p. 6). By all indications, we are already in the &#8220;whirlpool,&#8221; so all that remains to be seen is how deep it will take us. Whatever the eventual outcome, &#8220;[O]ne thing is certain: if our &#8216;basic needs&#8217; are affected, it is easy to imagine that the situation <italic>could</italic> become immeasurably catastrophic&#8221; (Servigne &amp; Stevens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>, pp. 2&#8211;3).</p>
