<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0505">Environmental provisions should be integrated into bi- and multilateral trade agreements, accounting for embodied climate and natural resource footprints and environmental health risks. Trade has played an important role in enabling economic growth, but it has also distanced producers and consumers and, in some cases, exported ecological footprints, environmental impacts, and polluting activities (e.g. <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Erb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Kastner et al., 2015</xref>). As discussed, the pandemic has had a heterogeneous impact on supply chains and trade in agricultural commodities and food products. During the recovery, there should be greater emphasis on assessing and, if necessary, restructuring supply chains and trade in terms of their capacity to absorb or adapt to multiple shocks and promote efficient and sustainable use of resources. In general, food trade can either increase or decrease the environmental impact of agriculture. This depends on whether or not the impact of a given agricultural activity is greater in the exporting than in the importing region. Trade may also drive further consumption and hence the associated production of particular food products with knock-on implications for environmental footprints. Building on robust assessment of environmental footprints embodied in supply chains and trade, provisions in bi- and multilateral trade agreements should be strengthened to accelerate the shift to better environmental standards and practices in food systems. The more explicit inclusion of environmental footprint considerations within the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) would help to increase the global environmental sustainability of agricultural production.</p>
