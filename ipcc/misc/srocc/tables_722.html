      <td>REDD+ has stimulated sustainable land-use investments but is also competing with other land uses (e.g., agroindustry) and scarce\ninternational funding (both public and private) (Bastos Lima et al. 2017b; Angelsen et al. 2018b).</td>

      <td>In the Amazon, at the local level, a critical issue has been the incorporation of indigenous people in the planning and distribution\nof benefits of REDD+ projects. While REDD+, in some cases, has enhanced participation of community members in the policy-planning\nprocess, fund management, and carbon baseline establishment, increasing project reliability and equity (West 2016), it is clear that,\nin this region, insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities, are probably\nthe major problems for REDD+ implementation (Loaiza et al. 2017). Despite legal and rhetoric recognition of indigenous land rights,\neffective recognition is still lacking (Aguilar-St&#248;en 2017). The key to the success of REDD+ in the Amazon, has been the application\nof both incentives and disincentives on key safeguard indicators, including land security, participation, and well-being (Duchelle\net al. 2017).</td>

      <td>On the other hand, at the subnational level, REDD+ has been unable to shape land-use dynamics or landscape governance, in areas\nsuffering strong exogenous factors, such as extractive industries, and in the absence of effective regional regulation for sustainable land\nuse (Rodriguez-Ward et al. 2018; Bastos Lima et al. 2017b). Moreover, projects with weak financial incentives, engage households with\nhigh off-farm income, which are already better off than the poorest families (Loaiza et al. 2015). Beyond operational issues, clashing\ninterpretations of results might create conflict between implementing countries or organisations and donor countries, which have\nrevealed concerns over the performance of projects (van der Hoff et al. 2018) REDD+ Amazonian projects often face methodological\nissues, including how to assess the opportunity cost among landholders, and informing REDD+ implementation (Kweka et al. 2016).\nREDD+ based projects depend on consistent environmental monitoring methodologies for measuring, reporting and verification and,\nin the Amazon, land-cover estimates are crucial for environmental monitoring efforts (Ch&#225;vez Michaelsen et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>In India, forests and wildlife concerns are on the concurrent list of the Constitution since an amendment in 1976, thus giving the\ncentral or federal government a strong role in matters related to governance of forests. High rates of deforestation due to development\nprojects led to the Forest (Conservation) Act (1980) which requires central government approval for diversion of forest land in any\nstate or union territory.</td>

      <td>Before 2006, forest diversion for development projects leading to deforestation needed clearance from the Central Government under\nthe provisions of the Forest (Conservation Act) 1980. In order to regulate forest diversion, and as payment for ES, a net present value\n(NPV) frame-work was introduced by the Supreme Court of India, informed by the Kanchan Chopra committee (Chopra 2017). The\nForest (Conservation) Act of 1980 requires compensatory afforestation in lieu of forest diversion, and the Supreme Court established the\nCompensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) which collects funds for compensatory afforestation\nand on account of NPV from project developers.</td>

      <td>As of February 2018, 6825 million USD had accumulated in CAMPA funds in lieu of NPV paid by developers diverting forest land\nthroughout India for non-forest use. Funds are released by the central government to state governments for afforestation and\nconservation-related activities to &#8216;compensate&#8217; for diversion of forests. This is now governed by legislation called the CAMPA Act,\npassed by the Parliament of India in July 2016. The CAMPA mechanism has, however, invited criticism on various counts in terms\nof undervaluation of forest, inequality, lack of participation and environmental justice (Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013).</td>

      <td>The other significant development related to forest land was the landmark legislation called the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional\nForest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 or Forest Rights Act (FRA) passed by the Parliament of India in 2007. This is the\nlargest forest tenure legal instrument in the world and attempted to undo historical injustice to forest dwellers and forest-dependent\ncommunities whose traditional rights and access were legally denied under forest and wildlife conservation laws. The FRA recognises\nthe right to individual land titles on land already cleared, as well as community forest rights such as collection of forest produce.\nA total of 64,328 community forest rights and a total of 17,040,343 individual land titles had been approved and granted up to the\nend of 2017. Current concerns on policy and implementation gaps are about strengths and pitfalls of decentralisation, identifying\ngenuine right holders, verification of land rights using technology and best practices, and curbing illegal claims (Sarap et al. 2013;\nReddy et al. 2011; Aggarwal 2011; Ramnath 2008; Ministry of Environment and Forests and Ministry and Tribal Affairs, Government\nof India 2010).</td>
