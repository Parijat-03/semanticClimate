They also show that ENSO warm phase (El Ni&#241;o) teleconnections are better represented than those for the cold phase (La Ni&#241;a). Individual CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a&#160;good ability to represent the observed teleconnections at aggregated spatial scales (Power and Delage, 2018; Section&#160;3.7.3 and Figure&#160;3.38). The evaluation of the atmospheric dynamical linkages is also an important part of the assessment. Hurwitz et&#160;al. (2014) showed that CMIP5 models broadly simulate the expected (as seen in the MERRA reanalysis) upper-tropospheric responses to central equatorial Pacific or eastern equatorial Pacific ENSO events in boreal autumn and winter. CMIP5 models also simulate the correct sign of the Arctic stratospheric response, consisting of polar vortex weakening during eastern and central Pacific Ni&#241;o events and vortex&#160;strengthening during both types of La Ni&#241;a events. In contrast, most CMIP5 models do not capture the observed weakening of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex in response to central Pacific ENSO events (Brown et&#160;al., 2013).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="498.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="498.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In RCMs, the effects of tropical large-scale modes and teleconnections are inherited through the boundary conditions and influenced by the size of the numerical domain. Done et&#160;al. (2015) and Erfanian and Wang (2018) claim that large domains that include source oceanic regions are required to capture the remote influence of teleconnections, although, without spectral nudging, this can lead to biased synoptic-scale patterns (Prein et&#160;al., 2019). RCMs generally reproduce the regional precipitation responses to ENSO, and can sometimes even improve the representation of these teleconnections compared to the driving reanalysis (Endris et&#160;al., 2013; Fita et&#160;al., 2017), but the overall performance may depend both on the driving reanalysis or GCM (Endris et&#160;al., 2016; Chandrasa and Montenegro, 2020) and on the chosen RCMs (Whan and Zwiers, 2017).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.77" top="318.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="318.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.55; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">New studies since AR5 have shown that model performance assessment regarding ENSO teleconnections remains a&#160;difficult challenge due to the different types of ENSO and model errors in ENSO spatial patterns, as well as the strong influence of atmospheric internal variability at mid- to high latitudes (Coats et&#160;al., 2013; Polade et&#160;al., 2013; Capotondi et&#160;al., 2015; Deser et&#160;al., 2017c; Tedeschi and Collins, 2017; Garcia-Villada et&#160;al., 2020). Another difficulty comes from the non-stationary aspects of teleconnections in both observations and models, raising methodological questions on how best to compare a&#160;given model with another model or observations (Herein et&#160;al., 2017; Perry et&#160;al., 2017; O&#8217;Reilly, 2018; O&#8217;Reilly et&#160;al., 2019; Abram et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="82.31" top="162.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="162.6" x1="82.31" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 84.0; x1: 86.81; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="84.0" y0="162.6" x1="144.77">robust evidence </span><span x0="146.46" y0="162.6" x1="298.78" style="x0: 146.46; x1: 149.28; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that an accurate representation of both atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) variability are key factors for the realistic representation of ENSO teleconnections in climate models. A&#160;robust and thorough evaluation of model performance regarding ENSO teleconnections is a&#160;challenging task with many methodological issues related to asymmetry between the warm and cold phases, non-stationarity and time-varying interaction between the Pacific and other ocean basins, signal-to-noise issues in the mid-latitudes and observational uncertainties, particularly for precipitation (Section&#160;10.2.2.3).</span></div><div left="348.94" right="449.28" top="714.48"><span x0="348.94" y0="714.48" x1="449.28" style="x0: 348.94; x1: 353.75; y0: 714.48; y1: 724.48; width: 4.81; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Phenomena&#160;and&#160;Processes</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.28" top="690.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="690.6" x1="557.28" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.19; y0: 690.6; y1: 700.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Regional climate is shaped by a&#160;wide range of weather phenomena occurring at scales from about 2000 km to 2 km (Figure&#160;10.3). These modulate the influence of large-scale atmospheric phenomena and create the characteristic and potentially severe weather conditions. The climate in different regions will be affected by different mesoscale phenomena, of which several may be relevant. A&#160;skilful representation of these phenomena is a&#160;necessary condition for providing credible and relevant climate information for a&#160;given region and application. Therefore, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different model types in simulating these phenomena. The performance of different dynamical climate model types to simulate a&#160;selection of relevant mesoscale weather phenomena is assessed here.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="486.32" top="534.6"><span style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.82; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="309.26" y0="534.6" x1="486.32">10.3.3.4.1 Convection including tropical cyclones</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="510.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="510.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.36; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Convection is the process of vertical mixing due to atmospheric instability. Deep moist convection is associated with thunderstorms and severe weather such as heavy precipitation and strong wind gusts. Convection may occur in single locations, in spatially extended severe events such as supercells, and organized into larger mesoscale convective systems such as squall lines or tropical cyclones, and embedded in fronts (see below). Shallow and deep convection are not explicitly simulated but parametrized in standard global and regional models. In consequence, these models suffer from several biases. AR5 has stated that many CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate the peak in the diurnal cycle of precipitation too early, but increasing resolution and better parametrizations help to mitigate this problem (Flato et&#160;al., 2014). Similar issues arise for RCMs with parametrized deep convection (Prein et&#160;al., 2015), which also tend to overestimate high cloud cover (Langhans et&#160;al., 2013; Keller et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="318.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="318.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 315.07; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Non-hydrostatic RCMs at convection-permitting resolution (4 km and finer) improve features such as the initiation and diurnal cycle of convection (Zhu et&#160;al., 2012; Prein et&#160;al., 2013a, b; Fosser et&#160;al., 2015; Stratton et&#160;al., 2018; Sugimoto et&#160;al., 2018; Finney et&#160;al.,&#160;2019; Berthou et&#160;al., 2020; Ban et&#160;al., 2021; Pichelli et&#160;al., 2021), the triggering of convection by orographic lifting (Langhans et&#160;al., 2013; Fosser et&#160;al., 2015), and maximum vertical wind speeds in convective cells (Meredith et&#160;al., 2015a). Also spatial patterns of precipitation (Prein et&#160;al., 2013a, b; Stratton et&#160;al., 2018), precipitation intensities (Prein&#160;et&#160;al., 2015; Fumi&#232;re et&#160;al., 2020; Ban et&#160;al., 2021; Pichelli et&#160;al., 2021), the scaling of precipitation with temperature (Ban et&#160;al., 2014), cloud cover (B&#246;hme et&#160;al., 2011; Langhans et&#160;al., 2013) and its resultant radiative effects (Stratton et&#160;al., 2018), as well as the annual cycle of tropical convection (Hart et&#160;al., 2018) are improved. Phenomena such as supercells, mesoscale convective systems, or the local weather associated with squall lines are not captured by global models and standard RCMs. Convection-permitting RCM simulations, however, have been shown to realistically simulate supercells (Trapp et&#160;al., 2011), mesoscale convective systems, their life cycle and motion (Prein et&#160;al., 2017; Crook et&#160;al., 2019), and heavy precipitation associated with a&#160;squall line (Kendon et&#160;al., 2014).
