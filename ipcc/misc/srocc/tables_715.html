      <td>New Zealand has a high proportion of agricultural emissions at 49% (Ministry of the Environment 2018) &#8211; the next-highest developed\ncountry agricultural emitter is Ireland at around 32% (EPA 2018) &#8211; and is considering incorporating agricultural non-CO gases into\n2\nthe existing national ETS. In the original design of the ETS in 2008, agriculture was intended to be included from 2013, but successive\ngovernments deferred the inclusion (Kerr and Sweet 2008) due to concerns about competitiveness, lack of mitigation options and the\nlevel of opposition from those potentially affected (Cooper and Rosin 2014). Now though, as the country&#8217;s agricultural emissions are\n12% above 1990 levels, and the country&#8217;s total gross emissions have increased 19.6% above 1990 levels (New Zealand Ministry for the\nEnvironment 2018), there is a recognition that, without any targeted policy for agriculture, only 52% of the country&#8217;s emissions face\nany substantive incentive to mitigate (Narassimhan et al. 2018). Including agriculture in the ETS is one option to provide incentives for\nemissions reductions in that sector. Other options are discussed in Section 7.4.4. Although some producer groups raise concern that\nincluding agriculture will place New Zealand producers at a disadvantage compared with their international competitors who do not\nface similar mechanisms (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018), there is generally greater acceptance of the need for climate\npolicies for agriculture.</td>

      <td>The inclusion of non-CO emissions from agriculture within an ETS is potentially complex, however, due to the large number of buyers\n2\nand sellers if obligations are placed at farm level, and different choices of how to estimate emissions from biological systems in cost-\neffective ways. New Zealand is currently investigating practical and equitable approaches to include agriculture through advice being\nprovided by the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC 2018). Main questions centre around the point of obligation for buying and\nselling credits, where trade-offs have to be made between providing incentives for behaviour change at farm level and the cost and\ncomplexity of administering the scheme (Agriculture Technical Advisory Group 2009; Kerr and Sweet 2008). The two potential points\nof obligation are at the processor level or at the individual farm level. Setting the point of obligation at the processor level means that\nfarmers would face limited incentive to change their management practices, unless the processors themselves rewarded farmers for\nlowered emissions. Setting it at the individual farm level would provide a direct incentive for farmers to adopt mitigation practices,\nhowever, the reality of having thousands of individual points of obligation would be administratively complex and could result in high\ntransaction costs (Beca Ltd 2018).</td>

      <td>Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of agricultural emissions presents another challenge, especially if emissions have to\nbe estimated at farm level. Again, trade-offs have to be made between accuracy and detail of estimation method and the complexity,\ncost and audit of verification (Agriculture Technical Advisory Group 2009).</td>

      <td>Some discussion in New Zealand also focuses on a differential treatment of methane compared to nitrous oxide. Methane is a short-\nlived gas with a perturbation lifetime of 12 years in the atmosphere; nitrous oxide on the other hand is a long-lived gas and remains\nin the atmosphere for 114 years (Allen et al. 2016). Long-lived gases have a cumulative and essentially irreversible effect on the\nclimate (IPCC 2014b) so their emissions need to reduce to net-zero in order to avoid climate change. Short-lived gases, however, could\npotentially be reduced to a certain level and then stabilised, and would not contribute further to warming, leading to suggestions\nof treating these two gases separately in the ETS or alternative policy instruments, possibly setting different budgets and targets for\neach (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018). Reisinger et al. (2013) demonstrate that different metrics can have important\nimplications globally and potentially at national and regional scales on the costs and levels of abatement.</td>

      <td>Australia&#8217;s Emissions Reduction Fund, and the preceding Carbon Farming Initiative, are examples of baseline-and-credit schemes,\nwhich creates credits for activities that generate emissions below a baseline &#8211; effectively a subsidy (Freebairn 2016). It is a voluntary\nscheme, and has the potential to create real and additional emission reductions through projects reducing emissions and sequestering\ncarbon (Verschuuren 2017) (low evidence, low agreement). Key success factors in the design of such an instrument are policy-\ncertainty for at least 10 to 20years, regulation that focuses on projects and not uniform rules, automated systems for all phases of the\nprojects, and a wider focus of the carbon farming initiative on adaptation, food security, sustainable farm business, and creating jobs\n(Verschuuren 2017). A recent review highlighted the issue of permanence and reversal, and recommended that projects detail how\nthey will maintain carbon in their projects, and deal with the risk of fire.</td>
