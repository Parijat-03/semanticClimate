I pick up three examples of such concepts: temperature threshold, carbon budget and climate deadline. These scientific metaphors (and their iconic graphics) have been widely circulated around different &#8216;cultural circuits&#8217; (Hall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>) of climate change communication. Three metaphors differ on ways in which the risk of climate change is expressed in terms of space and time. But they all constitute what I call the discourse of <italic>climate scarcity</italic>&#8212;the cognitive view of that there is an upper limit to the level of warming that must not be exceeded to avoid dangerous climate change and that we have (too) little space (the allowable amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) and time (the date for reaching a temperature limit) to stay below the prescribed limit.</p>
