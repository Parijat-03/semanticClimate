However, this has definitely not been the case. Hosting the podcast has revealed many things. Clearly, there is a great need for this type of content, to educate the mainstream environmental movement about the many existing DQTBIPOC leaders. As organizations seek to diversify their members and boards, and educate themselves about equity in the environmental field, the BGC podcast can serve as a resource. It can also continue to break stereotypes and implicit bias within the environmental field.</p>
