<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0095">The third part of the book begins with a dispatch from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. While not located on the ocean, the forest is one of twenty-eight Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) centers in the United States. These centers provide scientists with the long-term research opportunities to study things like climate change. It is here that Rush encounters researchers tracking the movements of the Rufous hummingbird, a migratory bird no larger than a spool of thread that travels nearly five-thousand miles to their breeding grounds in the forest from their wintering areas surrounding the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas where Cypress trees meet the marshes that Rush has been reporting. Through these tiny hummingbirds, the interconnectedness and the scope of the crisis crystalizes. It is easy to focus only on the human causes and impacts of climate change, but when thinking about how our actions impact the broader web of life on Earth, it becomes more difficult to justify continuing extractive human behavior.</p>
