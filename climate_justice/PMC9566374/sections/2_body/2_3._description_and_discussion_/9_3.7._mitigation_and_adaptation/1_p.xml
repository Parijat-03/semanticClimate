<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate change prevention measures fall into two main categories: (1) mitigation measures, which aim to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions; and (2) adaptation measures, which aim to prepare for the various effects of climate change, for example, the impact on health. Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches to reducing the risks of the impacts of climate change in various time scales. In the short-term, and throughout this century, mitigation could substantially reduce the effects of climate change in the last decades of the XXI century and beyond. The benefits of adaptation can be obtained both by approaching current risks, given that the effects of climate change are already being felt, and, in the future, by approaching emerging risks [<xref rid="B97-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Many cities with a Mediterranean climate are already implementing various mitigation and adaptation policies. Some examples of good practices include Cape Town&#8217;s water conservation policies, Los Angeles&#8217; heat reduction policies, Seattle&#8217;s equity and environment agenda, or Izmir&#8217;s climate and health surveillance system.</p>
