NDVI is strongly coupled to precipitation in drylands where precipitation has high inter-annual variability. This means that NDVI trend can be dominated by any precipitation trend and is sensitive to wet or dry periods, particularly if they fall near the beginning or end of the time series. Degradation may only occur during part of the time series, while NDVI is stable or even improving during the rest of the time series. This reduces the strength and representativeness of a&#160;linear trend.

De Jong et al. (2013) examined the NDVI time series for major shifts in vegetation activity and found that 74% of drylands experienced such a&#160;shift between 1981 and 2011.

Each of these datasets has been derived to overcome some limitation in existing indices. Studies have compared vegetation indices globally (Zhang et al. 2017) and speci&#64257;cally over drylands (Wu 2014). In general, the data from these vegetation indices are available only since around 2000, while NDVI data is available since 1982. With less than 20 years of data, the trend analysis remains problematic with vegetation indices other than NDVI.

A&#160;recent alternative approach to differentiating woody from herbaceous vegetation&#160;involves the combined use of optical/infrared-based vegetation indices, indicating greenness, with microwave based Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) which is sensitive to both woody and leafy vegetation components (Andela et al. 2013; Tian et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.81" top="591.59"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.87; y0: 591.59; y1: 601.09; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="591.59" x1="565.81">Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) has been available since the 1980s. VOD is based on microwave measurements and is related to total above-ground biomass water content. Unlike NDVI, which is only sensitive to green canopy cover, VOD is also sensitive to water in woody parts of the vegetation and hence provides a&#160;view of vegetation changes that can be complementary to NDVI. Liu et al. (2013) used VOD trends to investigate biomass changes and found that VOD was closely related to precipitation changes in drylands. To complement their work with NDVI, Andela et al. (2013) also applied the RESTREND method to VOD. By interpreting NDVI and VOD trends together they were able to differentiate changes to the herbaceous and woody components of the biomass.
