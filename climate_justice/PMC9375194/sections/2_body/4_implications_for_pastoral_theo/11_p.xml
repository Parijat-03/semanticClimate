To be clear, this is not the platitudinous hope that, unfortunately, we sometimes hear coming from religious pulpits, where we are encouraged to simply have faith in God above who ostensibly has everything, including the climate emergency, under control. De La Torre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) has already warned us convincingly about the overvaluation of hope, particularly the hopeful optimism of progressive Christianity: &#8220;Regardless of the good intentions of those who are privileged by society, or the praxis they employ to paternalistically save the world&#8217;s marginalized, the devastating consequences of neoliberalism and climate change will worsen as the few get wealthier and the many sink deeper into the despair of stomach-wrenching poverty&#8221; (p. 3). This has even prompted LaMothe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2022</xref>) to argue that, given the present climate emergency, a theology of radical care for all people, in particular those who are most vulnerable and at risk, must take precedence over a theology of hope.</p>
