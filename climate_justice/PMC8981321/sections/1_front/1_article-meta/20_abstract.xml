<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Climate change is driving a public mental health crisis that disproportionately, and unjustly, affects the world&#8217;s young people. Despite the growing evidence for harm to the next generation, the medical community has largely been hesitant to take the next step and act on the evidence. We propose that the medical community has a responsibility to do more.</p><p>Drawing from our interdisciplinary experience in paediatrics and psychiatry, we call for our profession to take the &#8216;leap&#8217; beyond the walls of our clinics and laboratories, and take a courageous stance on the topic of climate change. We argue that the medical profession must adopt a broader conception of health and its determinants&#8212;or a &#8216;social lens&#8217;&#8212;if it is to move beyond rhetoric to action.</p><p>Viewing climate change as a clear determinant of mental health opens up potential avenues of action, both as individual clinicians and as a profession as a whole. We offer the beginnings of a framework for action in the context of climate change and youth mental health, before calling for our profession to re-examine its role - and its very purpose - to better address the climate crisis.</p></abstract>
