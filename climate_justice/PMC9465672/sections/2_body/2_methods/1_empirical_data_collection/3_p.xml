The results of the MCA indicate that the first factorial axis explains 80% of the variability of the HHs' characteristics (namely, age, gender, education). This factorial axis discriminated the group of HHs constituting the elderly and women from the group constituting the HHs younger than 69 and having more years of formal education. Following from that, the variables of household composition, workforce, productive structure, and sources of income were analyzed by age group of HH. The Gamma coefficient (for ordinal data) and the Contingency coefficient (for categorical data) were used to find out the level of association between each of the variables and the age of the HH. These values &#8203;&#8203;are presented whenever there are statistically significant differences between the age group of the HH and the variable under analysis (depending on the p-value).</p>
