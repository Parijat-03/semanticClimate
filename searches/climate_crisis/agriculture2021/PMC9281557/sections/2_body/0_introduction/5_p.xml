As oil prices fall, governments have opportunities to implement carbon-emission reduction policies, make direct investments in renewable energy production, and promote a transition to cleaner energy. Coronavirus pandemic's impact on the oil industry have reduced greenhouse gases to some extent. However, reducing employment by destroying industries has never been the preferred approach for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and global warming. The most cost-effective ways to deal with carbon emissions are to maintain vegetation and soil biological resources, use conservation, improved efficiencies, and renewable energy, and reduce energy demand. Global warming has caused a great deal of concern worldwide, and clean energy must be used to solve this problem.<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> If investments in the low-carbon economy increased after the corona crisis, economic progress could be put back on track.<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> According to previous studies, the cost of countermeasures will be lower if the principle of prevention against climate change is implemented, such as the prevention of coronavirus.<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>
