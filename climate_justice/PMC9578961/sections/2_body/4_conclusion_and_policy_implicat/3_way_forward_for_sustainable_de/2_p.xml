The transition towards SDGs granted tailored analyses on such components when examining access to finance, financial innovation and microfinance as a resilience policy bound to empower the vulnerable. Nonetheless, a greater effort toward environmental and governance issues seems to be necessary. Increased importance has been attributed to the issues of access to finance and microfinance and innovative financial instruments. The economic and social components have been largely covered by the pertinent SDGs on access to finance and microfinance, whilst the environmental and institutional dimensions are not sufficiently tackled.</p>
