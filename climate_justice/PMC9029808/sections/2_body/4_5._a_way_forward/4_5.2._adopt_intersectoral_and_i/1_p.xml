Including the voices of young people, who will be most impacted in the long term, is paramount. Adaptation and mitigation measures should be designed and implemented with the participation of affected communities to develop integrated and comprehensive responses to challenges [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. An intersectoral and inclusive governance framework, which aims to encompass the diversity of interests, perspectives, and impacts of climate change at the national, regional, and/or municipal levels, is vital for encouraging ownership, capacity, and consensus around policies, as well as for successful implementation, which can be achieved when every impact of climate change is taken into account [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As demonstrated in the case studies of young people mobilizing for climate action through litigation and grassroots mobilization, youth are already driving intersectoral accountability on governments&#8217; inaction on multiple dimensions. Including youth and their knowledge can spur greater evidence-based policymaking, M&amp;E, and more cost-effective measures in addressing the social consequences of the climate crisis [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This approach also helps to avoid violating protected rights even more so now that participatory rights are part of both human rights law and environmental law as well many national laws [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
