<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Rural African farmers tend to suffer a lot from adverse weather conditions. This further creates a need for cheap and reliable weather forecast system. To attend to such needs in Nigeria [<xref rid="B82-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], a cheap automatic weather station that functions on solar energy was designed. By linking meteorological sensors to microcontrollers, the farmer could gain access to processed information related to weather, through a television screen. A thermometer collects temperature information, while the anemometer and LDR measures wind speed and sunlight, respectively. Embedded temperature sensors within the microcontroller receives analog information gathered by the thermometer and converts it to digital signals [<xref rid="B82-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In some cases, unprocessed data can also be sent to farmer&#8217;s mobile phones. The cheap rate of the unit shows that it can serve as a very good system for crop management and food security, in the least developed nations. </p>
