A grassroots movement refers to an initiative to help individuals engage in community interventions and activities with the mission of instrumenting local and societal change for the collective interest of the community (de Souza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>; Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Rothman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1996</xref>). Grassroots organizations have shown promising results in raising awareness and encouraging community involvement (Christens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; People&#8217;s Association [PA] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>; Paul and Tan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2003</xref>; Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2000</xref>), but the debate over top-down versus bottom-up approaches in climate change education (CCE) has long persisted (Fadeeva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>).&#160;</p>
