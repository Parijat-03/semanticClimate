Climate change presents the greatest market failure (Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2008</xref>), which externalizes the emissions cost. As a result, atmospheric sink capacity has become rival, and this rivalness in public good is argued as a source of power for those who are not willing to replenish it (DeSombre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>). The continued under-pledges of mitigation in the NDCs reflect this, that even 100% compliance of the pledges will push to a 3 &#176;C temperature rise (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>). But nobody questions the basic properties of mitigation as a GPG.</p>
