Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (DMRC) will act as a Coordinating / Managing Entity (CME) for the PoA. The emission reductions under this programme will be calculated. Delhi Metro Project has potential to generate more than 6 lakhs CERS annually just from Phase-3 operations. Project has potential to generate more than 6 lakhs CERS annually just from phase-3 operations. Furthermore, upcoming Metro projects across India can avail benefits of CDM through DMRC&#8217;s MRTS PoA. DMRC will act as umbrella for all other upcoming MRTS projects interested to join MRTS PoA.
