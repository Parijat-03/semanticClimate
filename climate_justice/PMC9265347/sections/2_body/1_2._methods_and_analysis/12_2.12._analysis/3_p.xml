<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In a randomisation check, we will examine the balance of outcomes and sociodemographic measures in the baseline data between the intervention and control arm. The continuous primary outcome (intentions of students to reduce their ecological footprint) will be compared between the intervention and control arm with an intention-to-treat analysis using a linear mixed model containing a dichotomous intervention group variable and a random effect for school classes to account for the nested data structure [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Secondary outcomes will be compared between the two study arms using analogous linear mixed models.</p>
