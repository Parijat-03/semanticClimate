<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0075">Nutrition knowledge is an important element of an effective food system, as a contributor to consumption of healthy diets. Knowledge about healthy diets is central to addressing issues of malnutrition that are associated with various health problems, including overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. Given the above-mentioned barriers that women face with respect to achieving food security, it is reasonable to assume that their access to nutrition knowledge and information is equally limited. Indeed, it is reported that the majority of the world's illiterate people (75%) are women (<xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2012</xref>). Limited nutrition knowledge contributes to food insecurity among women. Additionally, various studies affirm that there is a strong and positive relationship between food insecurity and violence against women (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Diamond-Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Hatcher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">Ricks et al., 2016</xref>). Violence against women and girls has significant negative effects on their ability to participate in social and economic activities as well as discharging their duties relating to household food consumption. The World <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bank (2019)</xref> reports that up to 35% of women in the world &#8216;have experienced &#8216;either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence&#8217;.</p>
