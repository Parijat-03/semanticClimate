We then went through an iterative process to select, organize, and relate the available information into a conceptual framework. As a starting point, we relied mainly on conceptual models of social determinants of health such as that of the World Health Organisation [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and that proposed by the Commission for the Reduction of Social Inequalities in Health in Spain [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as previous work on climate change and health by the Lancet Commission [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and by McMichael [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
