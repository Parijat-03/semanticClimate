This improvement can be measured by comparing climate simulations against historical observations. Both the current and previous generations of models show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming. While past warming is well simulated by the new generation models as a group, some individual models simulate past warming that is either below or above what is observed. The information about how well models simulate past warming, as well as other insights from observations and theory, are used to refine this Report&#8217;s projections of global warming.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.76" top="575.23"><span x0="69.02" y0="575.23" x1="539.76" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 575.23; y1: 584.23; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate models are important tools for understanding past, present and future climate change. They are sophisticated computer programs that are based on fundamental laws of physics of the atmosphere, ocean, ice, and land. Climate models perform their calculations on a three-dimensional grid made of small bricks or &#8216;gridcells&#8217; of about 100 km across. Processes that occur on scales smaller than the model grid cells (such as the transformation of cloud moisture into rain) are treated in a simplified way. This simplification is done differently in different models. Some models include more processes and complexity than others; some represent processes in finer detail (smaller grid cells) than others. Hence the simulated climate and climate change vary between&#160;models.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="473.25"><span x0="69.02" y0="473.25" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 473.25; y1: 482.25; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Climate modelling started in the 1950s and, over the years, models have become increasingly sophisticated as computing power, observations and our understanding of the climate system have advanced. The models used in the IPCC First Assessment Report published in 1990 correctly reproduced many aspects of climate (FAQ 1.1). The actual evolution of the climate since then has confirmed these early projections, when accounting for the differences between the simulated scenarios and actual emissions. Models continue to improve and get better and better at simulating the large variety of important processes that affect climate. For example, many models now simulate complex interactions between different aspects of the Earth system, such as the uptake of carbon dioxide by vegetation on land and by the ocean, and the interaction between clouds and air pollutants. While some models are becoming more comprehensive, others are striving to represent processes at higher resolution, for example to better represent the vortices and swirls in currents responsible for much of the transport of heat in the ocean.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="335.28"><span x0="69.02" y0="335.28" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 335.28; y1: 344.28; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Scientists evaluate the performance of climate models by comparing historical climate model simulations to observations. This evaluation includes comparison of large-scale averages as well as more detailed regional and seasonal variations. There are two important aspects to consider: (i) how models perform individually and (ii) how they perform as a group. The average of many models often compares better against observations than any individual model, since errors in representing detailed processes tend to cancel each other out in multi-model averages.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.82" top="257.3"><span x0="69.02" y0="257.3" x1="539.82" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 257.3; y1: 266.3; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">As an example, FAQ 3.3 Figure&#160;1 compares simulations from the three most recent generations of models (available around 2008, 2013 and 2021) with observations of three climate variables. It shows the correlation between simulated and observed patterns, where a value of 1 represents perfect agreement. Many individual models of the new generation perform significantly better, as indicated by values closer to 1. As a group, each generation out-performs the previous generation: the multi-model average (shown by the longer lines) is progressively closer to 1. The vertical extent of the colored bars indicates the range of model performance across each group. The top of the bar moves up with each generation, indicating improved performance of the best&#160;performing models from one generation to the next. In the case of precipitation, the performance of the worst performing&#160;models is similar in the two most recent model generations, increasing the spread across models.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.8" top="143.32"><span x0="69.02" y0="143.32" x1="539.8" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 143.32; y1: 152.32; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Developments in the latest generation of climate models, including new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, have improved the simulation of many aspects of the Earth system.
