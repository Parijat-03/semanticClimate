Cutter et al. [<xref rid="B53-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] applied their framework to assessing resilience, and Napier et al. [<xref rid="B54-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] were interested in the role of culture as a health determinant. However, since climate change as a &#8220;wicked problem&#8221; [<xref rid="B57-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] systemically affects human-made and natural environments, factors that contribute to risks of illness are also of relevance in the climate change context.</p>
