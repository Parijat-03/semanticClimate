Spatial resolutions vary from 11 world regions to&#160;0.25&#160;degrees gridcells (Bauer et al. 2018). While model projections identify potential areas for CDR implementation (Heck et al. 2018), the interaction with climate-change-induced biome shifts, available land and its vulnerability to degradation are unknown. The crop/forest types and management practices that will be implemented are also unknown, and will be in&#64258;uenced by local incentives and regulations. While it is therefore currently not possible to project the area at risk of degradation from the implementation of land-based CDR, there is a&#160;clear risk that expansion of energy crops at the scale anticipated could put signi&#64257;cant strain on land systems, biosphere integrity, freshwater supply and biogeochemical &#64258;ows (Heck et al. 2018). Similarly, extraction of biomass for energy from existing forests, particularly where stumps are utilised, can impact on soil health (de&#160;Jong et al. 2017). Reforestation and afforestation present a&#160;lower risk of land degradation and may in fact reverse degradation (Section&#160;4.5.3) although potential adverse hydrological and biodiversity impacts will need to be managed (Caldwell et al. 2018; Brinkman et al. 2017). Soil carbon management can deliver negative emissions while reducing or reversing land degradation.

Additionally, large areas are classi&#64257;ed as marginal lands and may be suitable for the implementation of bioenergy and land-based CDR (Woods et al. 2015). The yield per hectare of marginal and degraded lands is lower than on fertile lands, and if CDR will be implemented on marginal and degraded lands, this will increase the area demand and costs per unit area of achieving negative emissions (Fritsche et al. 2017). The selection of lands suitable for CDR must be considered carefully to reduce con&#64258;icts with existing users, to assess the possible trade-offs in biodiversity contributions of the original and the CDR land uses, to quantify the impacts on water budgets, and to ensure sustainability of the CDR land use. </span></div><div left="59.52" right="307.55" top="87.55"><span style="x0: 59.52; x1: 63.39; y0: 87.55; y1: 97.05; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.52" y0="87.55" x1="307.55">Land use and land condition prior to the implementation of CDR affect climate change bene&#64257;ts (Harper et al. 2018).

For example, buffers of Miscanthus and other grasses can enhance soil carbon and reduce water pollution (Cacho et al. 2018; Odgaard et al. 2019), and strip-planting of short-rotation tree crops can reduce the water table where crops are affected by dryland salinity (Robinson et al. 2006). Shifting to perennial grain crops has the potential to combine food production with carbon sequestration at a&#160;higher rate than annual grain crops and avoid the trade-off between food production and climate change mitigation (Crews et al. 2018; de Olivera et al. 2018; Ryan et al. 2018) (Section&#160;4.9.2).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="459.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 459.59; y1: 469.09; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="459.59" x1="566.12">Changes in land cover can affect surface re&#64258;ectance, water balances and emissions of volatile organic compounds and thus the non-GHG impacts on the climate system from afforestation/reforestation or planting energy crops (Anderson et al. 2011; Bala et al. 2007; Betts 2000; Betts et al. 2007) (see Section&#160;4.6 for further details). Some of these impacts reinforce the GHG mitigation bene&#64257;ts, while others offset the bene&#64257;ts, with strong local (slope, aspect) and regional (boreal vs. tropical biomes) differences in the outcomes (Li et al. 2015).
