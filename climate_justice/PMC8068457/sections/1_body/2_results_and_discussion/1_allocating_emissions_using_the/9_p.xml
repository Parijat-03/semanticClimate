<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par36">The RCP1.9 scenario is a very ambitious mitigation scenario that entails a drastic reduction of global emissions. At a global level, the cumulative emissions projected by the RCP1.9 for 83&#160;years, 2018&#8211;2100, reach 53 GtCO<sub>2eq</sub> and are 15.3% lower than the ones emitted in the 24&#160;year period from 1994 to 2017. This implies that, on average, between 2018 and 2100, 15.3% less than the cumulative emissions released into the atmosphere in the period 1994&#8211;2017 will be available to the world. However, based on equity, some countries should make reduction efforts above the world average while others could remain below. Taking this 15.3% as a reference value and looking at the results from Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, two significant groups can be defined (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>):
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par37">Those that would have to address the future with a reduction of cumulative emissions greater than the world average, which means greater than 15.3%: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Libya, Malta, Montenegro, Slovenia, and Spain. Of these Mediterranean countries, eight belong to the EU27, and all of them along with Israel are classified by the WB as high-income countries. The remaining three, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Libya, are classified as upper-middle-income countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are coal producers, and their electricity sector is based on this fuel, and Libya is a great oil and natural gas producer (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019b</xref>). All of these countries have emissions per capita above the Mediterranean region average, even doubling them, as in the case of Libya or almost doubling them as in the case of Israel (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In all of them, a trend in GHG emissions reduction is observed, with the only exception of Bosnia and&#160;Herzegovina, a trend also reflected in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, as their emissions per capita in 2017 are lower than the average in the historical period (1994&#8211;2017) (PIK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>). This group should implement more ambitious mitigation policies and lead the fight against climate change.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Those countries that could address the future carry out mitigation efforts below the world average, which is less than 15.3%: Albania, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey. Two subgroups can be distinguished in this group:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39">Algeria and Turkey have cumulative emissions in 2018&#8211;2100, similar to the ones accumulated in the historical period 1994&#8211;2017. To achieve the target of adjusting their future emissions to the allocated ones and thus adjust to the mitigation pathways compatible with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C goal, these countries should already be in their peak of emissions and start implementing policies to maintain themselves with a very limited budget. The trend of increasing emissions for Turkey, which moves the country away from the possible stabilization and reduction scenarios (PIK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>), is of special concern.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Albania, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia could have clearly higher (30% or more) cumulative emissions compared to the historical period 1994&#8211;2017. All of these countries are non-Annex I and, therefore, under the UNFCCC, are considered developing countries. As observed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the emissions per capita are around 40% below the region&#8217;s average, and based on the results of the MCJ, they could delay reaching their peak of emissions for several years. A key aspect that will be discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> is that all these countries should dedicate their allocated emissions to their development agenda in order to ensure the well-being of their population as well as a low emissions future.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of GHG cumulative emissions in the historical period (1994&#8211;2017) with those allocated by the MCJ for the period (2018&#8211;2100).
