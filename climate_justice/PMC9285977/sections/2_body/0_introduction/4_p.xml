Through a systematic review of the field, we have identified two waves in which the publication of articles on the governance of climate change in urban areas has accelerated. The first wave of <italic toggle="yes">urban optimism</italic>, which dominated the debate between 2011 and 2013, included research that represented urban areas as alternative sites for governance in the face of national disinterest and a collapsing international climate regime. The second wave of <italic toggle="yes">urban pragmatism</italic>, which took shape around 2016 and is still growing, engages with the need to reimagine urban governance to integrate the &#8220;sub&#8208;national&#8221; as a meaningful category within the framework of the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate Action. The analysis of critical narratives emerging from the last decade of research in cities and climate change demonstrates the close relationship between international policy discourses and climate change scholarship.</p>
