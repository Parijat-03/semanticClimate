<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">International Human Rights Law (IHRL), like IEL, features an implicit focus on human health and well-being, albeit through the imposition of protective policies against abusive acts which could threaten any one of its many sub-domains. There are notable areas where IHRL and IEL intersect to promote a policy environment conducive to human health. For example, climate-friendly policies are increasingly being linked to our moral duty to uphold Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which states that &#8220;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person&#8221;&#8212;rights which climate destructive actions explicitly threaten. Yet &#8220;environmental law continues to struggle with the complaint that it re-articulates some of the patterns of colonial exploitation in environmental terms&#8221;, most notably by treating nature&#8217;s resources as mere commodities and by failing to provide an enabling framework for indigenous populations to regain rightful stewardship over their lands [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Hence, reconciling environmental and human rights law remains an ongoing process, one which will arguably be central to creating a health-friendly legislative environment in the years to come.</p>
