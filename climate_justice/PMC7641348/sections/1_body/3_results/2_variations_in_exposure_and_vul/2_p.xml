<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The relationship between future heat exposure and vulnerability varies based on the exposure metric and vulnerability index employed. Compared to the rest of the state, California&#8217;s most vulnerable communities are projected to experience a larger increase in daytime heat waves and heat index days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). This relationship is most pronounced for vulnerability measured with SVI or CES. Vulnerable communities are also projected to experience more nighttime heat waves, but the increase is more pronounced in less vulnerable communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Communities of all levels of vulnerability defined by HHAI are projected to experience similar changes in heat exposure moving forward. One reason for this divergence is that HHAI considers heat adaptive capacity indicators that are not present in the other indices, such as the presence of outdoor workers or tree canopy coverage. These results present general trends for the entire state. However, there remain multiple highly vulnerable communities that face elevated exposure to nighttime events. The choice of index influences how risk is measured across census tracts in California.</p>
