Changes in melt water from ice and snow often dominates the runoff response to climate change at higher elevations, while changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration become increasingly important at lower elevations (Kormann et al., 2015). Permafrost thaw may affect runoff by releasing water from ground ice (Jones et al., 2018) and indirectly by changing hydrological pathways or ground water recharge as permafrost degrades (Lamontagne-Hall&#233; et al., 2018). The relative importance of runoff from thawing permafrost compared to runoff from melting glaciers is expected to be greatest in arid areas where permafrost tends to be more abundant (Gruber et al., 2017). Because glaciers react more rapidly to climate change than permafrost, runoff in some mountain landscapes may become increasingly affected by permafrost thaw in the future (Jones et al., 2018).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="403.35" top="339.65"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 325.74; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.15; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="339.65" x1="403.35">In summary, there is </span><span style="x0: 404.96; x1: 409.0; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.15; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="404.96" y0="339.65" x1="484.68">very high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 486.29; x1: 489.11; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.15; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="486.29" y0="339.65" x1="571.49">that glacier and snow cover decline have affected and will continue to change the amounts and seasonality of river runoff in many snow-dominated and/or glacier-fed river basins.
