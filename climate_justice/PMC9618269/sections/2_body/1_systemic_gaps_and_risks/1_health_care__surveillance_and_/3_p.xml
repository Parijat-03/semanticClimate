One month from the index case, there were 81 cases, 1 death and 3 recoveries spread across 10 States (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). 41% of the cases within the first 30&#160;days have an unknown source of infection. Lagos and Abuja with major international air travel hubs in Nigeria accounted for most of the cases. Ejigbo, the epicentre in Osun State, accounted for about 9% of the cases, this could be attributed to indigenes who had to return to Nigeria from Cote d&#8217;Ivoire and other neighbouring countries due to the pandemic (Amzat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). The gaps in Nigeria&#8217;s surveillance and slow response led to the situation she has had to grapple with today. Similarly, if climate change is still taken with levity, this will be like walking literarily towards the abyss.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of coronavirus outbreak in Nigeria (February 27&#8211;June 7, 2020) </p><p><italic>Source</italic> Amzat et al.
