<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Organizations such as the New-York Historical Society have long collected from significant events, including the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001&#8212;an experience that Liebhold also recounts here. Yet rapid-response collecting, so named for its aim to salvage artifacts during or just after events occur, pose other challenges and ethical concerns. Mahoney describes these as predatory, and archivists of color often decry them as a form of institutional exploitation and opportunism. In a blog post, the archivist Eira Tansey raises a related concern: How might stories of trauma become &#8220;commodities for outsiders to consume every time hurricane season rolls around or a new anniversary&#8221; occurs?&#160;Such practices fly in the face of what scholars advocate as a decolonizing process of &#8220;slow archiving&#8221; that demands time to establish relationships of trust, listening, and an ethics of care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup></p>
