They are the interface of three interconnected realities. First, they are critical nodes of global trade, economic activity and coast-dependent livelihoods, all of which are highly and increasingly exposed to climate- and ocean-driven hazards (FAQ CCP2.1). Second, coastal C&amp;S are also sites where some of the most pressing development challenges are at play (e.g., trade-offs between expanding critical built infrastructure while protecting coastal ecosystems, high economic growth coupled with high inequality in some coastal megacities). Third, coastal C&amp;S are also centres of innovation and creativity, thus presenting a tremendous opportunity for climate action through a range of infrastructural, nature-based, institutional and behavioural solutions (FAQ CCP2.2). Given these three realities of high climate change risks, rapid but contested and unequal development trajectories, and high potential for innovative climate action, C&amp;S are key to charting pathways for climate resilient development (CRD).</span></div><div left="60.38" right="542.53" top="558.08"><span x0="60.38" y0="558.08" x1="542.53" style="x0: 60.38; x1: 65.38; y0: 558.08; y1: 567.08; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Three key levers can enable pathways that are climate resilient and meet goals of inclusive, sustainable development. One key enabler involves flexible, proactive, and transparent governance systems, built on a bedrock of accountable local leadership, evidence-based decision-making&#8212;even under uncertainty&#8212;and inclusive institutions that consider different stakeholder voices and knowledge systems. Another key enabler is acknowledging the sociocultural and psychological barriers to climate action and incentivising people to change to lifestyles and behaviours that are pro-climate and aligned with community-oriented values and norms. In practice, coastal C&amp;S are experimenting with different strategies to change practices and behaviours, such as using subsidies and zoning policies, tax rebates and public awareness campaigns to promote individual and collective action. Finally, enabling CRD needs dedicated short- and long-term financing to reorient current trajectories of unsustainable and unequal development towards climate mitigation and adaptation action that reduces current and predicted losses and damages, especially in highly vulnerable coasts such as the small island states, the Arctic and low-lying C&amp;S. Currently, adaptation finance is concentrated in coastal megacities and tends to be deployed for risk-proofing high-value waterfront properties or key infrastructures. Addressing these financial imbalances (globally, regionally and sub-nationally) remains a critical barrier to inclusive climate resilient coastal development.</span></div><div left="60.38" right="542.46" top="384.12"><span x0="60.38" y0="384.12" x1="542.46" style="x0: 60.38; x1: 66.88; y0: 384.12; y1: 393.12; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Notwithstanding the many interconnected challenges faced, from more frequent and intense extreme events to the COVID-19 pandemic, many coastal C&amp;S are experimenting with ways to pivot towards CRD. Critical enablers have been identified and lesson learned, which, if translated into practice, will enhance the prospects for advancing the SDGs and charting pathways for CRD that are appropriate to local contexts and foster human well-being and planetary health.</span></div></body></html>
