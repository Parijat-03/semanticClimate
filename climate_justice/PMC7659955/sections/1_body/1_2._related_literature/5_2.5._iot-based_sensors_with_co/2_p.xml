<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Mat et al. [<xref rid="B41-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] presented an IoT-based mushroom cultivation, which produced a better yield when compared to the conventional system. This tool is based on an automated sensors for fertilizer application and water sprinkling on the farm, which can be controlled from the farmer&#8217;s mobile phone or manually, from a centralized point within the farm. The system ensures that the timing for wetting the crop is strictly adhered to, so that the farming operation can progress even without the farmer. Overall, it was observed that average mushroom size in thickness and weight exceeded conventional cultivation by 0.3 cm and 5 gram, respectively.</p>
