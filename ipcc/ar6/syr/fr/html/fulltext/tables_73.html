      <td>At the time of the present assessment88 there are gaps between global ambitions and the sum of declared\nnational ambitions. These are further compounded by gaps between declared national ambitions and current\nimplementation for all aspects of climate action. For mitigation, global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by NDCs\nannounced by October 2021 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5&#176;C during the 21st century and would\nmake it harder to limit warming below 2&#176;C.89 Despite progress, adaptation gaps90 persist, with many initiatives\nprioritising short-term risk reduction, hindering transformational adaptation. Hard and soft limits to adaptation\nare being reached in some sectors and regions, while maladaptation is also increasing and disproportionately\naffecting vulnerable groups. Systemic barriers such as funding, knowledge, and practice gaps, including lack of\nclimate literacy and data hinders adaptation progress. Insufficient financing, especially for adaptation, constraints\nclimate action in particular in developing countries. (high confidence)</td>
