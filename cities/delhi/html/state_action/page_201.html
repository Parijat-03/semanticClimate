Preservation of species rich ecosystems, restoration of degraded ecosystems, biodiversity enrichment of depauperated forests and recreation of lost natural heritage in urban centres not only provide mitigation and adaptation to climate change but also ensure climate resilience. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="334.62" top="575.64"><span x0="72.02" y0="575.64" x1="334.62" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 575.64; y1: 587.64; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi city has a network of species rich Biodiversity Parks which are unique landscapes, where 100s of plants, microbes and animals live together in the form of biological communities. These Biodiversity Parks provide a wide range of ecological services and goods to the citizens of Delhi ranging from storage and recharge of flood waters, clean air, regulate storm water and combat desertification ad others. The Biodiversity Parks have also conservation, cultural and educational values. Presently the network of Biodiversity Parks spreads over 1500 acres. There is a proposal to develop 26250 acres of Riverfront of Yamuna river and its flood plains into a mosaic of wetlands, floodplain forests and greenways. This will be also a part of network of Biodiversity Parks. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="265.73" top="391.06"><span x0="72.02" y0="391.06" x1="265.73" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 391.06; y1: 403.06; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The six Biodiversity Parks of DDA are: (i)the Yamuna, (ii)the Aravalli, (iii)Neela Hauz, (iv)the Tilpath Valley, (v)the Northern Ridge (vi)Tughlakabad; Of these 6 Biodiversity Parks, Yamuna and Aravalli Biodiversity Parks are fully functional and become Nature Reserves of Delhi and simulate National Parks/ Wildlife Sanctuaries/ Wilderness. The protected forests of Ridge and city forests constitute major greens that can also be made climate resilient through biodiversity enrichment. The Asola and Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuaries of Government of NCT Delhi are also highly degraded and can be made climate resilient through habitat improvement and biodiversity enrichment. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.4" top="174.79"><span x0="72.02" y0="174.79" x1="526.4" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 174.79; y1: 186.79; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">DDA&#8217;s greens, particularly urban parks can be made climate resilient through re-designing, restoration and biodiversity enrichment.
