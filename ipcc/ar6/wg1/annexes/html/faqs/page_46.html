Land-use changes can alter precipitation patterns and how water is absorbed into the ground, flows into streams and rivers, or floods the land surface, as well as how moisture evaporates back into the air. Changes in any of these aspects of the interconnected water cycle can affect the entire cycle and the availability of freshwater resources.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.46" top="600.27"><span x0="74.69" y0="600.27" x1="545.46" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.19; y0: 600.27; y1: 609.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Land use describes the combination of activities and ground cover defining each area of the Earth&#8217;s continental surface. Altering land use can modify the exchange of water between the atmosphere, soil and subsurface (FAQ&#160;8.1, Figure&#160;1). </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.53" top="558.27"><span x0="74.69" y0="558.27" x1="545.53" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.19; y0: 558.27; y1: 567.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">For instance, changes in land cover can affect the ability of soils to soak up surface water (infiltration). When soil loses its capacity to soak up water, precipitation that would normally infiltrate and contribute to groundwater reserves will instead overflow, increasing surface water (runoff) and the likelihood of flooding. For example, changing from vegetation to urban cover can cause water to flow rapidly over buildings, roads and driveways and into drains rather than soaking into the ground. Deforestation over wide areas can also directly reduce soil moisture, evaporation and rainfall locally but can also cause regional temperature changes that affect rainfall patterns.</span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.52" top="468.29"><span x0="74.69" y0="468.29" x1="545.52" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 79.7; y0: 468.29; y1: 477.29; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Extracting water from the ground and river systems for agriculture, industry and drinking water depletes groundwater and can increase surface evaporation because water that was previously in the ground is now in direct contact with the atmosphere, being available for evaporation. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.49" top="426.3"><span x0="74.69" y0="426.3" x1="545.49" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 80.19; y0: 426.3; y1: 435.3; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Changing land use can also alter how wet the soil is, influencing how quickly the ground heats up and cools down and the local water cycle. Drier soils evaporate less water into the air but heat up more in the day. This can lead to warmer, more buoyant plumes of air that can promote cloud development and precipitation if there is enough moisture in the air. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.46" top="372.3"><span x0="74.69" y0="372.3" x1="545.46" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 80.19; y0: 372.3; y1: 381.3; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Changes in land use can also modify the amount of tiny aerosol particles in the air. For instance, industrial and domestic activities can contribute to aerosol emissions, as do natural environments such as forests or salt lakes. Aerosols cool down global temperature by blocking out sunlight but can also affect the formation of clouds and therefore the occurrence of precipitation (see FAQ 7.2). </span></div><div left="74.69" right="485.51" top="318.31"><span x0="74.69" y0="318.31" x1="485.51" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 80.7; y0: 318.31; y1: 327.31; width: 6.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Vegetation plays an important role in soaking up soil moisture and evaporating water into the air (</span><span style="x0: 485.51; x1: 489.01; y0: 318.31; y1: 327.31; width: 3.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="485.51" y0="318.31" x1="540.02">transpiration</span><span x0="540.02" y0="318.31" x1="545.52" style="x0: 540.02; x1: 543.02; y0: 318.31; y1: 327.31; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">) through tiny holes (</span><span style="x0: 157.32; x1: 160.82; y0: 306.32; y1: 315.32; width: 3.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="157.32" y0="306.32" x1="191.33">stomata</span><span x0="191.33" y0="306.32" x1="545.51" style="x0: 191.33; x1: 194.33; y0: 306.32; y1: 315.32; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">) that allow the plants to take in carbon dioxide. Some plants are better at retaining water than others, so changes in vegetation can affect how much water infiltrates into the ground, flows into streams and rivers, or is evaporated. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.48" top="264.32"><span x0="74.69" y0="264.32" x1="545.48" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 83.19; y0: 264.32; y1: 273.32; width: 8.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">More globally, land-use change is currently responsible for about 15% of the emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities, leading to global warming, which in turn affects precipitation, evaporation, and plant transpiration. In addition, higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide due to human activities can make plants more efficient at retaining water because the stomata do not need to open so widely. Improved land and water management (e.g.,&#160;reforestation, sustainable irrigation) can also contribute to reducing climate change and adapting to some of its adverse consequences. </span></div><div left="74.69" right="545.5" top="186.34"><span x0="74.69" y0="186.34" x1="545.5" style="x0: 74.69; x1: 77.19; y0: 186.34; y1: 195.34; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In summary, there is abundant evidence that changes in land use and land cover alter the water cycle globally, regionally and locally, by changing precipitation, evaporation, flooding, groundwater, and the availability of freshwater for a&#160;variety of uses. Since all the components of the water cycle are connected (and linked to the carbon cycle), changes in land use trickle down to many other components of the water cycle and climate system. </span></div></body></html>
