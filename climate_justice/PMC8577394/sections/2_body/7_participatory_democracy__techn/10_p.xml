In Arnstein&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1969</xref>) famous &#8220;ladder of participation&#8221; formulation, it is up to the analyst to evaluate whether the public&#8217;s participation is impactful or symbolic, and the experiences and opinions of participants themselves are somewhat sidelined. Yet in cases where participation is designed as toothless from the start, why would anyone participate at all? Why would people be motivated to take part in a participation process that is designed to undermine their input? One common answer is that the public is na&#239;ve and does not recognize that participation processes are symbolic. The starting point for this case study is that this answer is unsatisfactory, and instead takes seriously the experience and perspective of people participating in the planning process to inductively theorize what motivates people to stay engaged in the planning process. The product is an ethnographically-informed description of what the public interprets as their <italic>influence</italic> in policy, defined as the recognition of one&#8217;s own input in the evolution of city plans.</p>
