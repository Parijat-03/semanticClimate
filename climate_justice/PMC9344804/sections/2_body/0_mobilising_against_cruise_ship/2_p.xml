The publication, which was one of the first to discuss the impact of cruise ships on the lagoon city, was the product of both Testa&#8217;s work as a&#160;journalist and his involvement in local protests. He used to be the spokesperson of the Committee No Big Ships&#8212;Lagoon Common Good (<italic>Comitato No Grandi Navi&#8212;Laguna Bene Comune</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> Since 2012, the committee has been one of the main actors in protests against the presence of cruise ships in Venice&#8217;s historical center and its lagoon. In this short passage, Testa draws on issues that have become central discourses in international debates about cruise ships. He emphasizes their disproportionate size and mocks the mode of travelling as a&#160;sea voyage characterized by aimlessness (Scheppe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>: 304). By referring to the <italic>Stazione Marittima</italic>, he hints at the spatial and functional transformation of a&#160;former focal point of Venice: once the trading hub and commercial heart, it was transformed into an area whose sole function is the processing of thousands of passengers. With many inhabitants of the city protesting the authorities&#8217; lack of action and the Port Authority&#8217;s disregard for their concerns, he identifies central issues surrounding the cruise industry, with governing bodies and inhabitants holding opposing views concerning issues of pollution, erosion, and sustainability.</p>
