The projected increase in hurricane intensity will undoubtedly be one of the most challenging climate change effects for vulnerable populations throughout this region as many already-vulnerable populations live within low-lying areas along the coast. One has only to recall the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast Southeastern states in 2005, to understand the potential loss of built capital (<italic>i.e</italic>., residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial infrastructure), human capital (<italic>i.e</italic>., life, physical and mental health), and social capital (<italic>i.e</italic>., social supports and networks, emergency funds) [<xref rid="B72-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. </p>
