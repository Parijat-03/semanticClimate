Interviews were conducted through online video via Zoom and lasted one hour. Audio of the interviews was recorded and transcribed for analysis, removing any identifiable information, and then destroyed. Interviews were coded and transcribed by NVivo Software. Following transcription, participants were contacted with a copy of the interview transcript for review and approval. We then conducted a content analysis of all transcripts, to identify common themes; we adhered to the guidelines of content analysis in [<xref rid="RSOS210006C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Two coders started by familiarizing themselves with the data and collaborating over the generation of initial content codes. Following the establishment of the codebook, they each coded two specific transcripts (i.e. the same ones), discussed discrepancies and revised the codebook as necessary. The remaining transcripts were split between the two coders. Upon completion of the coding process, they then worked collaboratively to identify, review and define the themes that arose.</p>
