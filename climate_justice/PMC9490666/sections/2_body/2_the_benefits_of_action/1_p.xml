There are also further benefits. Reducing air pollution improves the respiratory health of local populations. Preserving biodiversity and environmental ecology mitigates against risks of emerging infectious diseases and future pandemics.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Decarbonization to limit warming to no greater than 1.5&#176;C above preindustrial levels prevents even more dangerous climate change, even worse health impacts, and increased inequality. We need to embark on a collective effort to rapidly and significantly reduce these emissions.</p>
