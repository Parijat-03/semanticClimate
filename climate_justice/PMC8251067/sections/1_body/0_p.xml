<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Over the past two centuries, more and more of humankind has taken progress for granted. Growing numbers of people have assumed that problems of various kinds will eventually be solved. Some problems have been alleviated &#8211; in privileged parts of the world &#8211; by economic and technological development, such as the drudgery of heavy labour that has been relegated to machines. Other issues have required legislation and political activism, such as the abolition of slavery, universal suffrage and agreements on human rights. After more than two centuries of such progress, there is a widespread expectation that social movements are a proper vehicle of change.</p>
