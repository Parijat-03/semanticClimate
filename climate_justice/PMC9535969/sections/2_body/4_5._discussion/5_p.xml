<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Most research on public engagement with geoengineering is not concerned with the ways in which these technologies are perceived in the context of a particular place (<xref rid="bibr7-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Buck, 2018</xref>). Since our FGs were the first exercise of the kind in Portugal, we attempted to explore how our national context could mediate the emergence of sociopolitical implications of these technologies, resorting to questions explicitly focussed on our country. The Portuguese context &#8211; including particular sociotechnical and environmental controversies &#8211; inevitably shaped the discourse on geoengineering. Some of these issues include lithium mining, Spanish nuclear power plants, dams and 5G. Since geoengineering is perceived as a &#8216;technofix&#8217;, it is framed as representing a continuation of undemocratic and top-down ways of governing the environment, potentially leading to negative health and environmental consequences and increasing North/South inequalities, reinforcing Portugal&#8217;s semi-peripheral condition in the European and global contexts.</p>
