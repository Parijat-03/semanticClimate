<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our selection of the primary and second outcomes was guided by the SIMPEA model (<xref rid="ijerph-19-08039-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Given that validated scales for assessing most outcomes were not available in German, we relied on items translated and adapted from international studies. When suitable items were not available, new items were created by the study team. The student survey is provided in a supplementary online appendix.</p>
