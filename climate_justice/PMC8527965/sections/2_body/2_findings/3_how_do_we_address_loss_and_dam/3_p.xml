Similarly, another stakeholder emphasised that there is a lack of prioritisation in terms of understanding loss at that local grassroots level: &#8220;&#8230;while NELD has been an objective of discussion at the national level, it is not part of conversation at the community level&#8212;especially the understanding of it and what it means for the Pacific people&#8221; (participant #42, 2020). These sentiments were reiterated by other stakeholders who argued: &#8220;&#8230;we need to first of all get the basics around loss and damage in place&#8221; (participant #16, 2020) and that there is &#8220;not an urgency, no finance available for this kind of survey [of loss and] damages&#8221; (participant #4, 2020). While there is limited documented understandings of the specifics of NELD at different scales in the Pacific Islands, this certainly does not mean that Pacific Islanders are not deeply aware of and familiar with such ideas. Future studies should continue to enrich and unpack the complex understandings and experiences of NELD at different scales in the Pacific.</p>
