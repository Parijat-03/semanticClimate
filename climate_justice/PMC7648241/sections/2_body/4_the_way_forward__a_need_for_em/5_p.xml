The coronavirus crisis has put a normal life of people on hold, requiring to not go back to the old normal but move onto the new normal. With a sense of urgency of the climate crisis, many people understand the politics must go beyond business as usual. Likewise, this is&#8212;and should be&#8212;a moment of change in our way of doing the science in times of crisis. It will be a moral failure of the science to keep ignoring the &#8220;black elephant&#8221; in an emergency room.</p>
