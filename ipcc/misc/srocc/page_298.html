Lack of access to credit limits adjustments and agricultural responses to the impacts of deserti&#64257;cation under changing climate, with long-term consequences for the livelihoods and incomes, as was shown during the North American Dust Bowl of the 1930s (Hornbeck 2012). Government policies aimed at improving market access usually involve constructing and upgrading rural&#8211;urban transportation infrastructure and agricultural value chains, such as investments into construction of local markets, abattoirs and cold storage warehouses, as well as post-harvest processing facilities (McPeak et al. 2006). However, besides infrastructural constraints, providing improved access often involves relieving institutional constraints to market access (Little 2010), such as improved coordination of cross-border food safety and veterinary regulations (Ait Hou et al. 2015; Keiichiro et al. 2015; McPeak et al. 2006; Unnevehr 2015), and availability and access to market information systems (Bobojonov et al. 2016; Christy et al. 2014; Nakasone et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="161.7" top="111.57"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 67.16; y0: 111.57; y1: 121.07; width: 7.91; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.24" y0="111.57" x1="161.7">Women&#8217;s empowerment. </span><span style="x0: 162.9; x1: 168.35; y0: 111.57; y1: 121.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="162.9" y0="111.57" x1="307.28">A&#160;greater emphasis on understanding gender-speci&#64257;c differences over land use and land management practices as an entry point can make land restoration projects more successful (</span><span style="x0: 126.33; x1: 133.19; y0: 75.57; y1: 85.07; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="126.33" y0="75.57" x1="199.37">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 199.37; x1: 202.01; y0: 75.57; y1: 85.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="199.37" y0="75.57" x1="307.31">) (Broeckhoven and Cliquet 2015; Carr and Thompson 2014; Catacutan and Villamor 2016; </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.83" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 323.22; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.58" x1="565.83">Dah-gbeto and Villamor 2016). In relation to representation and authority to make decisions in land management and governance, women&#8217;s participation remains lacking particularly in the dryland regions. Thus, ensuring women&#8217;s rights means accepting women as equal members of the community and citizens of the state (Nelson et al. 2015). This includes equitable access of women to resources (including extension services), networks, and markets. In areas where socio-cultural norms and practices devalue women and undermine their participation, actions for empowering women will require changes in customary norms, recognition of women&#8217;s (land) rights in government policies, and programmes to assure that their interests are better represented (Section&#160;1.4.2 and Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11 in Chapter&#160;7). In addition, several novel concepts are recently applied for an in-depth understanding of gender in relation to science&#8211;policy interface. Among these are the concepts of intersectionality, that is, how social dimensions of identity and gender are bound up in systems of power and social institutions (Thompson-Hall et al. 2016), bounded rationality for gendered decision-making, related to incomplete information interacting with limits to human cognition leading to judgement errors or objectively poor decision making (Villamor and van Noordwijk 2016), anticipatory learning for preparing for possible contingencies and consideration of long-term alternatives (Dah-gbeto and Villamor 2016) and systematic leverage points for interventions that produce, mark, and entrench gender inequality within communities (Manlosa et al. 2018), which all aim to improve gender equality within agroecological landscapes through a&#160;systems approach.</span></div><div left="317.77" right="566.0" top="399.62"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.52; y0: 399.62; y1: 409.12; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="317.77" y0="399.62" x1="566.0">Education and expanding access to agricultural services. </span><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.34; y0: 387.62; y1: 397.12; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="387.62" x1="565.82">Providing access to information about SLM practices facilitates their adoption (</span><span style="x0: 356.79; x1: 363.65; y0: 375.62; y1: 385.12; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="356.79" y0="375.62" x1="429.06">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 429.06; x1: 431.7; y0: 375.62; y1: 385.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="429.06" y0="375.62" x1="565.79">) (Kassie et al. 2015; Nkonya et al. 2015; Nyanga et al. 2016). Moreover, improving the knowledge of climate change, capacity building and development in rural areas can help strengthen climate change adaptive capacities (Berman et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2018; Descheemaeker et al. 2018; Popp et al. 2009; Tambo 2016; Yaro et al. 2015). Agricultural initiatives to improve the adaptive capacities of vulnerable populations were more successful when they were conducted through reorganised social institutions and improved communication, for example, in Mozambique (Osbahr et al. 2008). Improved communication and education could be facilitated by wider use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Peters et al. 2015). Investments into education were associated with higher adoption of soil conservation measures, for example, in Tanzania (Tenge et al. 2004). Bryan et al. (2009) found that access to information was the prominent facilitator of climate change adaptation in Ethiopia. However, resource constraints of agricultural services, and disconnects between agricultural policy and climate policy can hinder the dissemination of climate-smart agricultural technologies (Morton 2017). Lack of knowledge was also found to be a&#160;signi&#64257;cant barrier to implementation of soil rehabilitation programmes in the Mediterranean region (Reichardt 2010). Agricultural services will be able to facilitate SLM best when they also serve as platforms for sharing indigenous and local knowledge and farmer innovations (Mapfumo et al. 2016). Participatory research initiatives conducted jointly with farmers have higher chances of resulting in technology adoption (Bonney et al. 2016; Rusike et al. 2006; Vente et al. 2016).
