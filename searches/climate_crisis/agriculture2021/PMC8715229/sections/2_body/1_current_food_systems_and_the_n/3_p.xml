<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0135">At one end of the spectrum, modern food systems often rely on complex supply chains, organized by large international agribusinesses and retailing companies, and the application of industrial production methods, in-time production, high diversity of products, strong price competition, and in some cases unequal or market power along the supply chain (UNEP 2016, <xref rid="bb0710" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2021</xref>). At the other end of the spectrum, we find traditional food systems, which are labor intensive, relying on smallholder and subsistence farmers, local markets, and supply chains, and partly or fully disconnected from international markets and products, as well as investments opportunities and farm inputs and technologies (UNEP 2016). It is acknowledged that in reality the boundaries between these different systems are often blurred in reality (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">HLPE, 2017</xref>). A variety of alternative and complementary categorizations exist, including a focus on prevalent production types and methods as well as expansion into emerging or niche food system types. While there is great diversity of food systems, typologies can be helpful in delineating some key characteristics and fostering a systems thinking approach (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ericksen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
