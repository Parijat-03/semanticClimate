<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This article is structured as follows. In the remainder of this section, we provide some background to the problem under investigation (the use of plastics, in particular single-use plastics), and a brief rationale for researchers taking an ecolinguistic approach, or at the very least adopting ecolinguistic principles, in addressing this problem. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_s_002" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref> describes the research context of our own (eco)linguistic work, first within the broader context of the existing literature and then within our multidisciplinary research project environment. Next, in <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_s_003" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, we outline the methodology of our study, starting with our ecosophy and then describing in detail the means by which we gathered our data and analyzed it using corpus linguistic software, incorporating cognitive linguistic and ecolinguistic perspectives. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_s_004" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref> reports some of the findings we were able to achieve using this approach, and <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_s_005" ref-type="sec">Section 5</xref> offers some recommendations for practical applications of these linguistic findings. Finally, in <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_s_006" ref-type="sec">Section 6</xref>, we conclude the article with some of the potential implications of this work, as well as some suggestions for future research.</p>
