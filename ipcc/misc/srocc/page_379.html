Remote sensing based inventory methods can measure reductions in canopy cover or carbon stocks more easiliy than reductions in biological productivity, losses of ecological integrity or value to humans. However, the causes of reductions in canopy cover or carbon stocks can be many (Curtis et al. 2018), including natural disturbances (e.g.,&#160;&#64257;res, insects and other forest pests), direct human activities (e.g., harvest, forest management) and indirect human impacts (such as climate change) and these may not reduce long-term biological productivity. In many boreal, some temperate and other forest types natural disturbances are common, and consequently these disturbance-adapted forest types are comprised of a&#160;mosaic of stands of different ages and stages of stand recovery following natural disturbances. In those managed forests where natural disturbances are uncommon or suppressed, harvesting is the primary determinant of forest age-class distributions. </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.94" top="135.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.73; y0: 135.55; y1: 145.05; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="135.55" x1="312.94">Quantifying forest degradation as a&#160;reduction in productivity, carbon stocks or canopy cover also requires that an initial condition (or&#160;baseline) is established, against which this reduction is assessed (Section&#160;4.1.4). In forest types with rare stand-replacing disturbances, the concept of &#8216;intact&#8217; or &#8216;primary&#8217; forest has been used to de&#64257;ne the initial condition (Potapov et al. 2008) but applying a&#160;single metric can be problematic (Bernier et al. 2017).

In these systems, forest degradation cannot be assessed at the stand level, but requires a&#160;landscape-level assessment that takes into consideration the stand age-class distribution of the landscape, which re&#64258;ects natural and human disturbance regimes over past decades to centuries and also considers post-disturbance regrowth (van Wagner 1978; Volkova et al. 2018; Lorimer and White 2003).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.48" top="591.58"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.65; y0: 591.58; y1: 601.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="591.58" x1="571.48">The lack of a&#160;consistent de&#64257;nition of forest degradation also affects the ability to establish estimates of the rates or impacts of forest degradation because the drivers of degradation are not clearly de&#64257;ned (Sasaki and Putz 2009). Moreover, the literature at times confounds estimates of forest degradation and deforestation (i.e.,&#160;the conversion of forest to non-forest land uses). Deforestation is a&#160;change in land use, while forest degradation is not, although severe forest degradation can ultimately lead to deforestation. </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.48" top="483.59"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.37; y0: 483.59; y1: 493.09; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="483.59" x1="571.48">Based on empirical data provided by 46 countries, the drivers for deforestation (due to commercial agriculture) and forest degradation (due to timber extraction and logging) are similar in Africa, Asia and Latin America (Hosonuma et al. 2012). More recently, global forest disturbance over the period 2001&#8211;2015 was attributed to commodity-driven deforestation (27 &#177;&#160;5%), forestry (26 &#177;&#160;4%), shifting agriculture (24 &#177;&#160;3%) and wild&#64257;re (23 &#177;&#160;4%).

This study, based on a&#160;thematic classi&#64257;cation of satellite data, suggests that (i) global tree canopy cover increased by&#160;2.24&#160;million km&#178; between 1982 and 2016 (corresponding to +7.1%) but with regional differences that contribute a&#160;net loss in the tropics and a&#160;net gain at higher latitudes, and (ii) the fraction of bare ground decreased by&#160;1.16&#160;million km&#178; (corresponding to &#8211;3.1%), mainly in agricultural regions of Asia (Song et al. 2018), see Figure&#160;4.5. Other tree or land cover datasets show opposite global net trends (Li et al. 2018b), but high agreement in terms of net losses in the tropics and large net gains in the temperate and boreal zones (Li et al. 2018b; Song et al. 2018; Hansen et al. 2013).
