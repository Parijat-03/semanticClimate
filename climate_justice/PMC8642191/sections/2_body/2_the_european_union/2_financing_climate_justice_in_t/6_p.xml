It is the compromise version of just transition that emerged from the EU legislative process. The JTM has been critiqued on the grounds of both substance (as a &#8216;restrictive interpretation&#8217; of just transition (Fleming and Mauger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2021</xref>, 174)) and procedure (insufficiently providing for community participation in the development of plans (Mauger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>, 8)). It is nevertheless a major step in concretely integrating climate justice, however imperfectly, into the EU&#8217;s legal order.</p>
