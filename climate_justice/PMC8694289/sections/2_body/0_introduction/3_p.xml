For example, there are sharply differing views on the role of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels during the transition to renewable energy sources.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Civil society organizations&#8212;including organizations of young people and of indigenous peoples, environmental groups, labor unions, professional associations, faith communities, and community-based organizations&#8212;will continue to advocate for climate action, including through print and online media and through their democratic representatives. There will also be street demonstrations and other forms of visible, public dissent if governments are perceived not to be responding adequately to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. The mobilization for climate action will increasingly involve public health actors who have not previously been engaged and whose efforts can benefit from a human rights perspective. As Alexandra Phelan noted in 2020, &#8220;framing climate change through a global health and human rights lens is a powerful catalyst for action to mitigate and adapt to the greatest threat to global health and human rights.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
