<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0040">We consider these three tenets (which have both a distributive/substantive and a representational/procedural component) as necessary and non-negotiable. Importantly, fostering a pro-poor focus within planetary justice scholarship and practice will also elicit greater social and political legitimacy for efforts at planetary stewardship (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gupta, 2019</xref>). Yet few analyses to date have outlined contours of a pro-poor focus within planetary justice.

We discuss, first, the extent to which the dominant approaches to planetary stewardship and earth system governance address the poor in their notions of justice, and then briefly sketch out what alternative approaches might be needed.</p>
