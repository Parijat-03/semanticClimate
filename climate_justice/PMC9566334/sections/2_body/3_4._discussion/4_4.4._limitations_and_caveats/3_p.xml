Prevalence merely classifies a census tract based on the most populous demographic group within the tract. There are cases where there is a higher population of a secondary group in an alternate primary category than in its neighboring primary grouping. For example, a census tract with a population that is 51% White and 49% Hispanic would be classified as a White prevalent tract. A neighboring tract with 26% Hispanic, 24% White, 25% Black, and 25% Asian would be a Hispanic prevalent tract. Assuming the population of the tract is around 4000 persons the White prevalent tract would have a higher Hispanic population than the designated Hispanic prevalent tract. This is an issue when examining the overall raw trends in SUHI intensity for each group and in the top 25 cities for each group in the dot plots. Prevalence is not used in the models when fitting SUHI intensity with the percentages of each demographic group or the <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> index. Since the modeling, not using the groups, tends to support the trends observed with the groupings, the effect is likely minimal</p>
