In an assessment of 166 initiatives in 16 countries, integrated landscape initiatives were found to address the drivers of agriculture, ecosystem conservation, livelihood preservation and institutional coordination. However, such initiatives struggled to move from planning to implementation due to lack of government and &#64257;nancial support, and powerful stakeholders sidelining the agenda (Zanzanaini et al. 2017). Special care helps ensure that initiatives don&#8217;t exacerbate socio-spatial inequalities across diverse developmental and environmental conditions (Anguelovski et al. 2016b).

Deserti&#64257;cation and land degradation are drawn-out processes that occur over many years, whereas extreme events are abrupt and require immediate attention. Similarly, the frequency of events might be of special interest &#8211; for example, events that occur periodically versus those that occur infrequently and/or irregularly. In the case of food security, abrupt and protracted events of food insecurity might occur. There is a distinction between &#8216;hunger months&#8217; and longer-term food insecurity. Some indigenous practices already incorporate hunger months whereas structural food de&#64257;cits have to be addressed differently (Bacon et al. 2014). Governance mechanisms that facilitate rapid response to crises are quite different from those aimed at monitoring slower changes and responding with longer-term measures.</span></div><div left="73.7" right="321.04" top="255.01"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 80.37; y0: 255.01; y1: 267.01; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="73.7" y0="255.01" x1="321.04">Case study |  Governance: Biofuels and bioenergy</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.95" top="231.52"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.51; y0: 231.52; y1: 241.02; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="231.52" x1="551.95">New policies and initiatives during the past decade or so have increased support for bioenergy as a non-intermittent (stored) renewable with wide geographic availability that is cost-effective in a range of applications.

As a result, a disadvantageous high land-use intensity compared to other renewables (Fritsche et al. 2017) that, in turn, place greater demands on governance. Bioenergy, especially traditional fuels, currently provides the largest share of renewable energy globally and has a signi&#64257;cant role in nearly all climate stabilisation scenarios, although estimates of its potential vary widely (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). Policies and governance for bioenergy systems and markets must address diverse applications and sectors across levels from local to global; here we brie&#64258;y review the literature in relation to governance for modern bioenergy and biofuels with respect to land and climate impacts, whereas traditional biomass use (see Glossary) (&gt; 50% of energy used today with greater land use and GHG emissions impacts in low- and medium-income countries (Bailis et al. 2015; Masera et al. 2015; Bailis et al. 2017a; Kiruki et al. 2017b)) is addressed elsewhere (Sections&#160;4.5.4 and 7.4.6.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7). The bioenergy lifecycle is relevant in accounting for &#8211; and attributing&#160;&#8211; land impacts and GHG emissions (Section&#160;2.5.1.5). Integrated responses across different sectors&#160;can help to&#160;reduce&#160;negative impacts and promote sustainable development opportunities (Table 6.9, Table 6.58, Chapter 6). </span></div></body></html>
