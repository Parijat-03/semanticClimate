In the 1990&#8211;99 cases, climate change was seldom explicitly mentioned as the core issue, and legal arguments primarily related to broader (though inherently climate-linked) issues of environmental harm and destruction, air and water pollution, and land-use change, amongst others. Anthropocentric conceptualizations of the environment as a human-serving/resource-producing asset were also notably more apparent in the 1990&#8211;99 cases.</p>
