Health co-benefits outweigh mitigation costs in the Republic of Korea up to 2050 (Kim et&#160;al., 2020). Low-carbon pathways consistent with the 2&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C long-term climate targets defined in the Paris Agreement are associated with the largest health co-benefits when coordinated with stringent air pollution controls in Asia followed by Africa and Middle East (Rafaj et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="582.62"><span x0="42.52" y0="582.62" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 582.62; y1: 592.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Strategies to increase energy efficiency in urban environments by compact urban design and circular-economy policies can reduce GHG emissions and reap ancillary health benefits; for example, compared with conventional single-sector strategies, national CO</span><span x0="251.36" y0="546.43" x1="254.02" style="x0: 251.36; x1: 254.02; y0: 546.43; y1: 551.97; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2</span><span x0="258.82" y0="546.6" x1="296.09" style="x0: 258.82; x1: 263.03; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">emissions can be reduced by 15&#8211;36%, and the annual deaths from 25,500 to 57,500 are avoidable from air pollution reduction in 637 Chinese cities (Ramaswami et&#160;al., 2017).

The adoption of global dietary guidelines was estimated to prevent 5.1&#160;million deaths per year relative to the reference scenario in which the largest number of avoidable deaths occurred in East Asia and South Asia, and GHG emissions would be reduced most in East Asia (Springmann et&#160;al., 2016). In China, dietary shifts to meet national dietary reference intakes reduced the daily carbon footprint by 5&#8211;28% depending on the scenario (Song et&#160;al., 2017). In India, the optimised healthy diets (e.g., lower amounts of wheat and increased amounts of legumes) could help reduce up to 30% water use per person for irrigation and reduce diet-related GHG emissions. This would result in 6800 life-years gained per 100,000 population in 2050 (Milner et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="221.82" top="257.98"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 48.76; y0: 257.98; y1: 269.98; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="42.52" y0="257.98" x1="221.82">10.5 Adaptation Implementation</span></div><div left="42.52" right="132.03" top="234.48"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.72; y0: 234.48; y1: 244.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="42.52" y0="234.48" x1="132.03">10.5.1 Governance</span></div><div left="42.52" right="155.33" top="210.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="210.48" x1="155.33" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 210.48; y1: 220.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.1.1 Points of Departure</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.08" top="186.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="186.6" x1="296.08" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.62; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate-change governance is characterised by a scalar/stakeholder turn which includes: (a) acknowledgement of the importance of both subnational and transnational&#8211;regional scales along with the global scale; (b) involvement of diverse stakeholders in decision-making systems; (c) reliance on bottom-up architectures of governance that are supported by the framework given by the SDGs; (d) emphasis on developmental and environmental co-benefits; (e) recognition of diverse experiences of marginalisation and social stratification, and their impacts on participation in governance-related activities; and (f) greater decentralisation and strengthening of local institutions.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="702.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="702.6" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In order to facilitate local adaptation, especially in a context characterised by regional diversity and spatio-temporal variation, climate-adaptive governance invites greater policy attention to institution building (formal and informal) at multiple scales and across sectors (Mubaya and Mafongoya, 2017). An incremental EbA approach underlines the advantage of drawing upon ecosystem services for reducing vulnerabilities, increasing resilience of communities to adapt to climate change, and minimising threats to social systems and human security, provided climate change remains below 2&#176;C or, better yet, below the 1.5&#176;C of global warming (Barkdull and Harris, 2018).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="570.62"><span x0="306.57" y0="570.62" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.61; y0: 570.62; y1: 580.12; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Focus on multi-level governance, both below and beyond the state level, is steadily growing (Jogesh and Dubash, 2015; J&#246;rgensen et&#160;al., 2015; Beermann et&#160;al., 2016). Discernible diversity across political systems and sectors in Asia notwithstanding, issues relevant to multi-level climate governance includes interplay between top-down national initiatives, which stem from supranational, regional and sub-regional levels. In the case of India, national climate governance has proliferated beyond the National Action Plan on Climate Change to include State Action Plans on Climate Change of over 28 states and union territories, demonstrating graphically the shared &#8216;co-benefit&#8217; in terms of creating greater space for innovation and experimentation (J&#246;rgensen et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="426.64"><span x0="306.57" y0="426.64" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 426.64; y1: 436.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In Japan&#8217;s Climate Change Adaptation Act, enacted by the Japanese Diet in June 2018, the national government shall formulate a national action plan to promote adaptation in all sectors. This Act recommends that prefectures and municipalities designate a &#8216;local climate change adaptation centre&#8217; as a local climate-change data collection and provision centre to provide more locally specific information and support for adaptation planning at the level of local municipalities. The Japanese government, in partnership with the private sector, has formulated a new comprehensive strategy, named Society 5.0, which aims at devising a number of technologically innovative solutions (Mavrodieva and Shaw, 2020).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.15" top="282.65"><span x0="306.57" y0="282.65" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Significantly, the co-benefit concept for international city partnerships along with comparative analysis of the challenges, capabilities and limitations of urban areas in Asia with regard to CCA governance remains under-researched (Beermann et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.17" top="222.66"><span x0="306.57" y0="222.66" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 222.66; y1: 232.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the case of Vietnam, especially at district and community levels, where the policy capacities in hierarchical governance systems to deal with climate-change impacts are generally constrained, the value of clear legal institutions, provision of financing for implementing policies and the training opportunities for governmental staff has been well demonstrated (Phuong et&#160;al., 2018b). A key finding is that any effort to support local actors (i.e., smallholder farmers) should ensure augmentation of policy capacity through necessary investments.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="114.67"><span x0="306.57" y0="114.67" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.87; y0: 114.67; y1: 124.17; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the case of China, a combination of market-based policies, emissions trading systems, a growing number of environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international networks appear to be serving as an important tool for climate governance (Ramaswami et&#160;al., 2017; Wang et&#160;al., 2017b).
