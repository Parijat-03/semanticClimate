Based&#160;on a decade of research on MSIs, the Institute for Multi-Stakeholder Initiative Integrity concluded, &#8216;MSIs should no longer be viewed as institutions that robustly ensure that their corporate members respect rights, provide access to remedy, or hold corporations accountable for abuses. They are simply not sufficiently resourced or structured to carry out these difficult functions. Regulation is needed for these purposes&#8217; (MSI Integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>).</p>
