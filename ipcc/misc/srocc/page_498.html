Manure management strategies are more applicable in con&#64257;ned systems, where manure can be easily collected, such as in pigs and poultry systems or in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems. More intensive systems, with strong market orientation, such as dairy in the US, can implement a&#160;range of sophisticated practices like feed additives and vaccines, while many market-oriented dairy systems in tropical regions can improve feed digestibility by improving forage quality and adding larger quantities of concentrate to the rations. Many of these strategies can be implemented as packages in different systems, thus maximising the synergies between different options (Mottet et al. 2017b).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="99.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 99.57; y1: 109.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="99.57" x1="566.07">See the Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for a&#160;detailed description of livestock mitigation strategies; synergies and trade-offs with other mitigation and adaptation options are discussed in Section&#160;5.6.</span></div></body></html>
