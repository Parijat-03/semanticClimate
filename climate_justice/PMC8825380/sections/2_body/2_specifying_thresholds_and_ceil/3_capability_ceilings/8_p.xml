If the SUV driver ceases &#8216;pleasure driving&#8217; in an SUV, it would free up money spent on gasoline, but there would also be health gains (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 417; Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 403) and omitted gas emissions. Moreover, some would claim that pleasure-driving an SUV is not a morally neutral act since it exposes others to harm (Hiller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>; Nolt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>). However, imposing such a restriction would limit an agent&#8217;s mobility and potentially infringe on property rights, or at the very least on the use of property. This reduces the two capabilities of bodily integrity (which includes being able to move freely) and control over one&#8217;s environment (which includes property rights) (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 417). Such restrictions are, in this framework, motivated when required to allow for others to reach a capability threshold. It could be in the form of a fair sharing of a common good being a prerequisite for capabilities, or imposing taxation.</p>
