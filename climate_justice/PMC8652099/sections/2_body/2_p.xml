A study published in Nature by Welsby et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>) suggests that in order to limit the increase of global temperatures within 1.5 &#176;C, about 90% of coal and 60% of oil and methane must remain unextracted. The study further adds that global oil and gas production must decline by 3% every year by 2050. While more than 40 countries agreed to quit coal for&#160;power generation&#160;and 23 countries signed for &#8216;COP26 Coal to Clean Power Transition Agreement&#8217; for the first time, some of the largest coal producers went missing from the agreement including Australia, China, India and United States (US). Hence, the final pact went from &#8216;phasing out coal&#8217; to &#8216;phasing down coal&#8217;. This is a major setback to the goals of COP26 and it is unlikely to limit global warming to the 1.5&#160;&#176;C that is needed to avert disasters. With around 36% of the total human population residing in China and India (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://beef2live.com/story-world-population-ranking-countries-0-106889">https://beef2live.com/story-world-population-ranking-countries-0-106889</ext-link>), these countries have their own worries to support their people, many of whom are in low income group. Hence, this requires prompt discussions and immediate action and support at international level.</p>
