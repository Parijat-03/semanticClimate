Climate change can therefore worsen the impact of these events and may do so in unequal ways. Indeed, research has already separately identified unequal social vulnerabilities in flood risks regardless of climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and increasing flood risks from climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. But, not much has been done to connect these two insights. Specifically, climate change&#8217;s precise role in shaping unequal social impacts now is not yet well-understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This is our focus here, where we combine extreme weather event attribution (to climatic change) research together with spatial quantitative social research.</p>
