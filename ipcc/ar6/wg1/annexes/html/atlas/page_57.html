Concurrently, the frequency of heavy precipitation events have 23 increased over India, while the frequency of moderate rain events have decreased since 1950 (high 24 confidence) (Goswami et al., 2006; Dash et al., 2009; Christensen et al., 2013; Krishnan et al., 2016; 25 Kulkarni et al., 2017; Roxy et al., 2017).
