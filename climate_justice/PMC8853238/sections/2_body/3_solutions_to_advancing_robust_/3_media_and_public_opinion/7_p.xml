Nevertheless, bipartisan public support for addressing climate change has not always translated into action by elected officials. Politicians (particularly Republicans) and their staff tend to drastically underestimate their constituencies&#8217; support for climate policy (Hertel-Fernandez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2019</xref>). Consequently, efforts to educate policymakers about existing public support and raise the salience of climate change have the potential to promote policy change.</p>
