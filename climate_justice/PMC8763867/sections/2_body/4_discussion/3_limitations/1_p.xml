First, although we assessed participant's reactions, we did not assess any impacts on their skills or knowledge and were therefore unable to evaluate several of our educational objectives. Additionally, our sample size was small, although it did include participants from multiple academic medical centers in one city. The curriculum itself also had limitations, namely, that it was a brief, onetime intervention and that the long-term impacts of this type of isolated training on the attitudes, skills, and knowledge of participants are unknown. Many participants expressed an interest in more in-depth trainings that would cover the full spectrum of community organizing, an interest that we are working to address by developing similar modules on full public narrative and other community organizing leadership practices. To address concerns raised in the evaluation about the level of psychological vulnerability required to workshop one's story of self in front of others, we clarified in the facilitator guide that when participants are asked to share their stories in front of the large group, they should be invited to do so privately and clearly given the option to decline. We also discussed having coaches connect with their small-group participants in phone calls prior to the workshop to develop their relationship and ensure participants know what to expect in the workshop.</p>
