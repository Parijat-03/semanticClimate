Issues around client access to reliable internet mean that phone-based services have an important role to play in remote service delivery. Clinicians and students need to be skilled in making the best use of digital platforms and to make them effective for clients. The structures used to interview and advise clients should be reviewed to ensure they operate in ways that foster client engagement and understanding of the issues they face, and the advice being offered to them.</p>
