Where trends intersect they can reinforce each other, intensifying risks and impacts, which affect the poor and most vulnerable people the hardest. </span></div><div left="43.35" right="514.93" top="702.4"><span x0="43.35" y0="702.4" x1="514.93" style="x0: 43.35; x1: 50.45; y0: 702.4; y1: 714.4; width: 7.1; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">Climate change risks and impacts can be reduced, within limits, if humans and nature adapt to the changing conditions. The scale and scope of actions to reduce climate risks (adaptation) have increased worldwide. Individuals and households along with communities, businesses, religious groups and social movements are adapting to climate change already. However, the Working Group II Report identifies large gaps between ongoing efforts, and adaptation needed to cope with current levels of warming, with the scale of the challenge varying in different regions. The report also highlights that the effectiveness of available adaptation options decreases with every increment of warming. Successful adaptation requires urgent, more ambitious and accelerated action and, at the same time, rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The quicker and further emissions fall, the more scope there is for people and nature to adapt (see FAQ 4 for further details).  </span></div><div left="43.35" right="533.55" top="572.32"><span x0="43.35" y0="572.32" x1="533.55" style="x0: 43.35; x1: 49.36; y0: 572.32; y1: 584.32; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">The focus of our new report is on solutions. It highlights the importance of fundamental changes in society at the same time as conserving, restoring and safeguarding nature in order to meet the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is clear now that minor, marginal, reactive or incremental changes won&#8217;t be sufficient. In addition to technological and economic changes, shifts in most aspects of society are required to overcome limits to adaptation, build resilience, reduce climate risk to tolerable levels, guarantee inclusive, equitable and just development and achieve societal goals without leaving anyone behind.  </span></div><div left="43.35" right="549.44" top="483.76"><span x0="43.35" y0="483.76" x1="549.44" style="x0: 43.35; x1: 49.36; y0: 483.76; y1: 495.76; width: 6.01; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: AAAAAG+ArialNarrow;">The strong and interdependent relationships between climate, nature and people are fundamental to reaching these goals. This is emphasized more strongly in the new Working Group II Report than in previous IPCC assessments. We now know that a healthy planet is fundamental to secure a liveable future for people on Earth and that&#8217;s why we say that the needs of climate, nature and local communities have to be considered together and prioritized in decision making and planning - every day and in every region of our world.  </span></div></body></html>
