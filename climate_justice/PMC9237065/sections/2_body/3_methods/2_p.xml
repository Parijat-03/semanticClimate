We develop a number of interpretations, based on (and designed to address) one of the&#160;three following&#160;equity components: (i) Responsibility, (ii) Capability, and (iii) Equality. We assume that any budget distribution will take into account one interpretation from each equity component, to a varying degree, allowing for combinations of the interpretations. However, before combining them, their individual impact is calculated, as discussed in the section &#8220;Description and calculation of interpretations&#8221; below.</p>
