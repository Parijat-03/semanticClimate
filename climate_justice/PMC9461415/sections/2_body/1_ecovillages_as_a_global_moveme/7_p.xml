The author also stresses that both intentional and traditional communities criticize the current development paradigm, which links economic growth to well-being. As mentioned by Liftin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>, p.190), &#8220;these communities have been creating parallel structures for self-government within the prevailing social order while demonstrating how to live well with less.&#8221; For some traditional communities, becoming an ecovillage also means claiming spiritual and cultural integrity as well as safeguarding respect for communal tradition and self-determination threatened by colonization and modernization (Dawson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; Simas&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>).</p>
