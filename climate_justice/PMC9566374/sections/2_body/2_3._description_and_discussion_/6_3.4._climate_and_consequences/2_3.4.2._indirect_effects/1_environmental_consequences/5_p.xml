In these areas, it is often necessary to resort to surface water to meet the needs of urban concentrations. In addition, the high population growth due to tourism in many cities with a Mediterranean climate, especially in summer, can further stress water systems during periods of drought. Moreover, extreme precipitation events can lead to floods that compromise drinking water infrastructure, jeopardize water quality and the cleanliness of recreational water (such as beaches, for example). Disastrous flash floods are already frequent and will likely become more frequent in many Mediterranean countries including Italy, France and Spain, affecting coastal areas, in particular, where population and urban settlements are growing in flood-prone areas [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
