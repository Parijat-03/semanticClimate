They make money and never return. Researchers are just useless.&#8221; Dawa&#8217;s words of irritation rolled out of his tongue with ease, unguarded, during a casual conversation about climate change research I was interested in. Although his statement was not directly pointed at me, like many researchers he knew, I was asking questions, recording interviews, and taking notes for months without a visible, tangible, and immediate benefit to the local people. But I was also a fellow villager, somebody he knew personally. His words did not surprise me. It was not the first or the last time I heard someone complain about the &#8220;researcher-type&#8221; folks. In 2018, a woman from a village north of Dawa&#8217;s shared that the villagers openly questioned the intentions of the researchers, who were hosting a lunch meeting to share their findings. The villagers mentioned that it was not apparent why they should care about the things the researchers were sharing. They were tired of seeing one group after another sharing findings of things that did not seem immediately relevant to them.</p>
