It also attracts researchers pursuing different scientific projects from Himalayan glacial melt to Sherpa genetic makeup to the impact of tourism on the local community. When researchers come, middle-aged male hotel owners living on the main trail to Mount Everest like Dawa are invited to participate in various formal activities including meetings and knowledge-sharing workshops. Researchers communicate and engage community members in ways that are similar to the development and conservation practitioners that frequent the region.</p>
