<p>The role of critical reflection to deconstruct power in practice is crucial and influences
our pedagogy. Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bay&#8217;s (2020)</xref> analysis elucidates the place of critical reflection as part of
critical situated thinking that can be taught to students to raise their awareness of self and
develop others&#8217; reference points or frameworks. This is a means to identify dominant
discourses in meaning-making, disrupt assumptions, rethink categories of
&#8216;identity&#8217; and reflect on the ways power is operating (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bay, 2020</xref>). Drawing on Arendt, Bay makes the point that &#8216;no-one is
tied to their identity in order to be included in politics; rather, political action asks us
not &#8220;what&#8221; we are but &#8220;who&#8221; we are&#8217; (p. 448) in
participating and acting collectively. It is a pedagogy that promotes situated critical
thinking and political action as a consequence. An example of this is the &#8216;Black Lives
Matter&#8217; movement where people of all ethnic and racial identities join together to
protest injustice in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 2020</xref>).</p>
