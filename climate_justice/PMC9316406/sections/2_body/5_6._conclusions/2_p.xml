<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The upward tendencies of global climate change, disasters, and other diverse crises have been urgently calling for GSW interventions. This article qualitatively highlights the three GSW practice components, determined from the two authors&#8217; critical reflections and evaluations. Understandably, the authors&#8217; critical reflections and evaluations are primarily influenced by their personal experiences and backgrounds (including the demographic variables), which have not been effectively examined in this article. Future studies could draw from a larger sampling size, apply different research methods (e.g., quantitative and mixed-method), and investigate and evaluate the essential components and evidence-based strategies that utilize GSW-specific pedagogical innovations. These efforts will promote GSW-specific education and professional training, and more importantly, integrate environmental and climate justice into social work research, education, and practice, advancing social work advocacy for social justice and eventually building healthy, resilient, and sustainable communities for all the inhabitants and co-inhabitants. Furthermore, global extreme events call for an all-inclusive approach to engage all stakeholders [<xref rid="B83-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. GSW also suggests developing related pedagogical innovations to engage extreme event-driven components in different disciplines. These approaches will eventually establish multidisciplinary professional teams to collaborate with various stakeholders in public, private, and not-for-profit sectors, building resilient and sustainable societies for all inhabitants and co-inhabitants. </p>
