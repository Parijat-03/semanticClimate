Using extreme heat adaptations in California as a case study, this work analyzed the role and limitations of quantitative measurements of vulnerability guiding equity-oriented adaptation policies in current practice. First, we found that using a single index to select &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities, a common practice, is restrictive and not representative of the nuances of environmental and climate justice. California has successfully targeted most of the projects from the California Climate Investments program to its most vulnerable communities, but several communities that would likely benefit from heat-related adaptations have been overlooked. Fortifying screening tools to take nuances into account could help strengthen the program moving forward.</p>
