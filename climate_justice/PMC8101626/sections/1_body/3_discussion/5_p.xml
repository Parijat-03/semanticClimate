Using a single keyword to identify tweets relating to an entire conference may have introduced selection bias, and other important keywords such as &#8220;chasingthesun,&#8221; which emerged as a weighted term in our topic modeling, may have been omitted. Despite this, we believe limiting our analysis to &#8220;IDWeek2020&#8221; strengthened our topic modeling as it did not introduce potential confounding tweets related to other events. Similarly, we extracted tweets only in the English language, and this study does not help inform topics or networks where the discussion was in another language. Finally, we recognize the risk of labeling bias by subjectively ascribing topics to weighted terms. To minimize this risk, 1 author performed the analysis while the other primarily labeled the topics with ultimate mutual agreement.</p>
