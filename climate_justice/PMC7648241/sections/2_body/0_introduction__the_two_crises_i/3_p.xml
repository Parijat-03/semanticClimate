In times of crisis, decisive intervention is required to prevent catastrophic damage from unfolding (Hulme et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Lidskog et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). The mathematical models predicted that unmitigated virus outbreak would lead to a precipitous rise in death rates from COVID-19 (Adam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). The distressing model predictions forced many governments to swiftly impose emergency measures that were unimaginable in normal times, such as shutting down schools and business, prohibiting public gatherings and closing national borders. Just like rescuing a patient taken to a hospital emergency room, these draconian measures were justified simply because it is ethically unacceptable not to save lives from <italic>preventable</italic> deaths (Orr and Wolff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Zinn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) called COVID-19 a &#8220;monstrous threat&#8221; that &#8220;legitimises significant restrictions to people&#8217;s freedom and is justified by the ethics to keep everyone safe&#8221;.</p>
