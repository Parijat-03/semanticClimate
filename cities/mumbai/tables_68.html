      <td>In Mumbai, 94% of households have access to\ntreated piped water and 79% have a tap in their\npremises. However, access is largely restricted\nor unavailable in informal settlements.\nDuring or after a disaster, the households\ndependent on alternate water sources, such as\ntankers or community taps, face vulnerability\nsince physical access via roads is impacted.\nDuring a heat wave or days of extreme heat, the\nhouseholds with limited access to piped water\nare vulnerable to health impacts. In times of\nwater cuts, these households may not be able to\naccess alternate sources such as water tankers\non account of affordability thereby restricting\ntheir access and increasing vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Only 58% of the households in the city have\naccess to toilets within their homes. This has led\nto greater dependency on public toilets,\nexposing people to health risks and safety and\nease-of-use issues, especially for women,\nchildren and persons with special needs. These\nconditions increase vulnerabilities during\nextreme events when physical access is\nhindered.\nUnhygienic methods of sewage and wastewater\ndisposal can pose serious health hazards, pollute\nsurface water and groundwater, exacerbate\nair pollution, worsening the impact in case of a\nclimate-induced hazard, such as flooding.</td>
