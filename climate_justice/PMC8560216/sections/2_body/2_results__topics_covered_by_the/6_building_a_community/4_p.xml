Some guests have also been invited for a second interviews in the future to check-in on progress and continue visibility of their work. The hope is that in time we will be able to create an advisory board that would assist in keeping the podcast connected to and in tune with the community issues and able to connect more with DQTBIPOC environmentalists who are making a difference in their communities.</p>
