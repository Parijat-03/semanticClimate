Temper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>) argues that recognitional justice (Fraser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000</xref>) can lead to inclusion of other onto-epistemological orientations within the dominant colonizing ones. Consequently, DEJ requires going beyond recognition and towards cultural and political self-determination, where people rely on their own sociocultural and political norms and structures (Rodr&#237;guez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>; Temper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>).</p>
