<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">An interaction in which a perturbation in one <em>climate</em> quantity causes a change in a second and the change in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in the first.</p>
<p>A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced. The initial perturbation can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability.</p>
