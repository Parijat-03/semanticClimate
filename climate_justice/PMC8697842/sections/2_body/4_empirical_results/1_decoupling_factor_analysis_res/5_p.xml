The findings of the decoupling factor analysis are presented in the third column of Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In 10 of 27 periods, Australia experienced decoupling between its population and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Hence, in the remaining 17 periods, re-coupling was observed between the country&#8217;s population and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. From 1991 to 2004, a consecutive re-coupling was found between the abovementioned variables. On the other hand, a consecutive decoupling was also observed among Australia&#8217;s population and emissions over the period 2007&#8211;2014. The annual average growth rates for Australia&#8217;s population and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. UNFCCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>) data indicates that per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the country increased from 16.3 to 17 tons. The relative decoupling between CO<sub>2</sub> and population could be considered as modest for Australia for the analyzed period. The decoupling factor results between Australia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and population are presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Decoupling factor results for Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and population over 1990&#8211;2017</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12053_2021_10014_Fig7_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>
