In order to incorporate another layer of analysis and to compare percentiles of thermal exposure, census tracts were categorized by their percentile ranking of SUHI intensity. This allows for the examination of the percentages from each population group living in the different thermal percentiles. For example, the percentage of Hispanic persons living in the 95th percentile of SUHI intensity.</p>
