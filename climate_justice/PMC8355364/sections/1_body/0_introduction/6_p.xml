We also analyzed which subjective processes of change in psychological determinants of collective action emerged in the context of student engagement for climate justice. By this, we mean that we analyzed the extent to which respondents themselves were aware that the motivations for their engagement may have changed over time and the extent to which they reflected these processes of change. In doing so, the study examined to what extent existing theories on conditions of participation in collective action can be applied to the field of student engagement for climate justice and in which respect theoretical extensions seem to be necessary.</p>
