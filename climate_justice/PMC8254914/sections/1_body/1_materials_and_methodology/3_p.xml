This method states that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a population, has the same weighting regardless of the number of authors, citations or references of a publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The bibliometric analysis followed the following steps (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It commenced by defining the search criteria, the keywords and the study period. At first, it was decided to use the terms &#8220;climate change induced migrat*&#8221; OR &#8220;climate migrat*&#8221; OR &#8220;climate refugee*&#8221; OR &#8220;environmental migrat*&#8221; to analyze the impact of climate change on the migratory movements of people.
