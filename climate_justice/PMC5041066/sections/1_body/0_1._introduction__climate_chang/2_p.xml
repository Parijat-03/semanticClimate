The distribution of risk in higher income populations resembles that of broader health and illness risk patterns in conditions affected by social determinants, linking climate change vulnerabilities to health vulnerabilities via their susceptibility to social disadvantages [<xref rid="B18-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
