<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In an ongoing study aimed at finding a sensor that is able to detect the level of progesterone in milk fed to cattle [<xref rid="B66-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], interdigital sensors are used, which are able to yield single side access to the substance being tested. Within the study, progesterone hormone of about 20 mg was allowed to dissolve in 0.5 mL of approximately 100 per cent ethanol. The solution was subsequently poured into about 1000 mL of pure Milli-Q water, so that a stock solution was achieved. Successive mixture dilution led to 0.02 ng/mL progesterone concentration. The sensor offered different results at varying progesterone concentration with sensitivity in the pitch range of 50 &#181;m [<xref rid="B66-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
