Each color corresponds to a vulnerability index: CES (blue), HHAI (green), and SVI (yellow). Exposure is measured as the increase in extreme heat events from the current period to the projected period for three metrics: daytime heat waves (a), nighttime heat waves (b), and heat index days (c).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0240841.g003"/></fig>
