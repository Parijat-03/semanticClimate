It &#8216;recognises the need to put in place an enabling framework that benefits all Member States and encompasses adequate instruments, incentives, support and investments to ensure a cost-effective, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition, taking into account different national circumstances in terms of starting points&#8217;, also acknowledging that the &#8216;transition will require significant public and private investments&#8217; (European Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>, par. 3&#8211;4). The European Climate Law, adopted in June 2021, requires the EU to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2021e</xref>, Art. 2.1, 4.1). The law requires the Commission to take into account the &#8216;need to ensure a just and socially fair transition for all&#8217; and &#8216;fairness and solidarity between and within Member States&#8217; (<italic>inter alia</italic>) in proposing a 2040 EU climate target (Ibid, Art. 4.5), while the public participation clause requires the Commission to &#8216;engage with all parts of society to enable and empower them to take action towards a just and socially fair transition&#8217; (Ibid, Art. 9.1).</p>
