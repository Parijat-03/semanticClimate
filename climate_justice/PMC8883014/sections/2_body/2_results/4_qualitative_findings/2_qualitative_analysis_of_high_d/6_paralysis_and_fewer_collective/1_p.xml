To the question &#8220;what worries you about climate change?&#8221; a few participants simply wrote: &#8220;Everything.&#8221; This high distress subsample described climate change disrupting their engagement with goals typically salient in emerging adulthood such as education, career, and family-related goals. One participant stated, &#8220;Even going to college and thinking of my future at times feels misguided and naive when facing the reality that there is a large chance that I won&#8217;t be able to have children, a future or a stable career in a world that is devastated by climate change.&#8221; Sacrificing parenthood to reduce population growth appeared to be one way some participants strived to maintain agency over what remained in their control, noting &#8220;Myself as a privileged person has a choice, is it responsible to bring more people into the world when I know population growth is a driver of climate change?&#8221; While these comments focused on disengaging from typical goals and milestones that may provide a sense of purpose or meaning, there was no mention of these being replaced with other goals or purpose. Actions that participants in this subsample were taking to address climate change primarily emphasized individual actions to reduce their carbon footprint, and those that did mention collective actions provided fewer details about those actions than the overall population. These participants seemed motivated to take action, but unable to engage in meaningful collective action. One participant described, &#8220;It is scary knowing we have such little time until we see catastrophe. I wish I could do more to help such as joining a club and being active in doing this but because of the pandemic it is just very hard to go out and meet with people [&#8230;] I wish there was a climate change group or something that I can talk to more people about it.&#8221; Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> provides sample paired responses to the questions about worries and actions in the high distress subsample and highlights the immensity of their worries along with a perception of the insignificance or even absurdity of their actions in the face of climate change.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Examples of worries and actions for high distress subsample (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;37)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>What if anything worries you about climate change?</th><th>What if anything do you do to address climate change?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>Actually, everything.</td><td>Taking action in petitions.</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>The world imploding</td><td>Recycling</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>The way that people of the world, private corporations, and elected governments reacted to covid-19 proves to me we are absolutely beyond fucked with climate-change.
