The effect of climate conditions on airway reactivity is well documented. For persons with inflamed and narrow airways, the saturation of CO<sub>2</sub> in classrooms or enclosed spaces obstructs air inhalation, with the possibility of causing respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Unlike dry climate which ameliorates the symptoms of asthma, the exposure of young asthmatic patients to poor indoor air quality or high humidity will frequently lead to acute exacerbations of their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Pollen increments and dust generated through air pollution further compound the risks of allergies among such subgroup. Coupled with this setback is dehydration, in light of insufficient access to potable water to replenish the body&#8217;s fluid. With some schools dependent on rivers and boreholes, climate change might further threaten their water security on two fronts: (i) South Africa is a (semi)arid country which implies that prolong aridities might dry up river basins; and (ii) hurricanes and tidal waves could lead to contamination of water bodies such as streams with dangerous chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The latter is particularly disquieting as a disproportionate percentage of educational institutions and water bodies are situated near areas with industrial activities, mine landfills, and trafficked roads. When plagued with water insecurity, the conventional pattern of hand-washing will be jeopardized, especially in an era where the COVID-19 pandemic has made it mandatory.</p>
