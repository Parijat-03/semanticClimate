The relevant IMO convention regarding environmental protection is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The IMO has 174 member states and a convention is deemed ratified when two-thirds of members agree. The discussion and evaluation of each new environmental regulation is handled by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which meets every 6&#8211;9&#160;months.</p>
