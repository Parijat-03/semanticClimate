In June 2019, the UK parliament amended the 2008 Climate Change Act to requiring the government to reduce the UK&#8217;s emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. In the midst of the pandemic, in April 2021, the UK announced an interim reduction target of 78% in carbon emissions by 2035&#8212;15&#160;years earlier than previously planned. In addition, the European Commission announced that the EU would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, instead of the 40% cut agreed 6&#160;years ago. This is a major step towards the EU&#8217;s overarching pledge of carbon neutrality by 2050. In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced via video-link to the UN General Assembly in New York that China would aim to reach peak emissions before 2030, followed by a long-term target to become carbon neutral by 2060. China is the world&#8217;s largest carbon emitter, accountable for around 28% of global emissions, and up to now has not committed to a long-term emissions goal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref></p>
