Considering the 2050 perspective, we note that for some countries a small subset of negotiation points result in zero emissions reductions compared to 2005 levels, which might imply allowances for increasing emissions until 2030. While most of the countries this refers to had higher emissions in 2019 than in 2005, and thus would still be required to reduce emissions, it does not hold true for three countries (Romania, Croatia, and Greece). Here, a minority of weighting combinations might allow rising emissions. Such a development would need to be considered in the context of the EU net-zero emission target by 2050, which&#8212;given the limited potential of negative emissions&#8212;essentially translates to a close-to-net-zero target for every country. Thus, equity considerations may prohibit rising emissions up to 2030, particularly if this would imply an increase in future stranded assets, and would need focused deliberation.</p>
