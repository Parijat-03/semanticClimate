Since the early influence of Florence Nightingale as we celebrate the 200th year of her birth in 2020, the environment has been critically important in public health. Nightingale's nursing philosophy and pioneering efforts were steeped in environmental nursing principles which are as relevant in the 21st century as when she first launched her prescient ideas. Further the 2020 State of the Science Congress on Nursing Research meeting of the American Academy of Nursing focused on <italic toggle="yes">The Environment's Impact On Health</italic>, with relevance for Nightingale's environmental principles and the challenges of climate change and health. Not since the 1918&#8211;1919 influenza pandemic&#8212;widely known as the Spanish flu, has the intersection of environment and health been viewed as so profound. It is interesting to note that the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic emerged during the Year of the Nurse 2020, a celebration of Florence Nightingale and her contributions to nursing and public health. Nightingale's contributions to addressing clean air, water, and light also offer unique contributions unlike any pandemic witnessed in over 100&#160;years. This requires that public health professionals and climate change advocates address this complex situation with the intersection of climate change and associated deleterious health consequences.</p>
