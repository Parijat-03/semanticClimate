The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame of 2030 SDG targets. Synergies and trade-offs across all individual options within a sector/system are aggregated into sector/system potentials for the whole mitigation or adaptation portfolio.  </span></div><div left="56.64" right="539.98" top="147.75"><span x0="56.64" y0="147.75" x1="539.98" style="x0: 56.64; x1: 62.73; y0: 147.75; y1: 157.71; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The length of each bar represents the total number of mitigation or adaptation options under each system/sector. The number of adaptation and mitigation options vary across system/sector, and have been normalised to 100% so that bars are comparable across mitigation, adaptation, system/sector, and SDGs. Positive links shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b and WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of synergies, represented here by the blue proportion within the bars. Negative links shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b and WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of trade-offs and is represented by orange proportion within the bars. &#8216;Both synergies and trade-offs&#8217; shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to </span></div></body></html>
