I am particularly grateful to Dr. Carol Ganzer, Managing Editor of the <italic>CSWJ</italic>, who accompanied me for the duration of this race and who provided the quality assurance that the journal&#8217;s content had clinical relevance. Carol would often query &#8220;What are the clinical implications of the research for practicing clinicians?&#8221; and &#8220;How will this paper specifically help a clinician with their client?&#8221;, two crucial questions that kept the <italic>CSWJ</italic> on course to deliver the promised objectives. The Springer editorial staff, both in the United States and in India, have been stellar throughout the years; Carol Bischoff, Jennifer Hadley, and Teresa Krauss, the Springer Editors and liaisons to the <italic>CSWJ</italic>, consistently provided advice and guidance that furthered the aims of the journal. My editorial assistants during this run ensured the integrity of the double-blind review process and kept the process on pace: Sarah Miller, Ruth Karasik, and Jennifer Bauwens. The editorial board members, guest editors, reviewers, and authors lent their good names to this endeavor, and have been instrumental to the success of the <italic>CSWJ.</italic></p>
