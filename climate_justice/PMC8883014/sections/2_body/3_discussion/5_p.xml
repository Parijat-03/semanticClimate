This is consistent with research and theory on the role of agency in supporting the mental health of vulnerable populations (Gong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Veronese et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>). Engaging in collective action may combat feelings of despair and helplessness and foster feelings of hope. Collective action also brings with it community connection and social support, which supports health and well-being (e.g., Lorimer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>; Velez &amp; Moradi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>). These results provide initial quantitative support for previous qualitative research in which climate activists describe collective action as a way to manage their fears, build hope, and create feelings of connection (Kleres &amp; Wettergren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>; Nairn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>). Participating in collective action may also serve similar functions as behavioral activation, an evidence-based treatment for MDD, and contribute to decreasing MDD symptoms.</p>
