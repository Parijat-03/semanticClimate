In fact, decolonizing the immaterial, that is the mind and imaginary, can act as a precondition for decolonizing the material, since to decolonize land and structures of colonial oppression requires, decolonizing the imaginary and mind is necessary. Such synergies are, however, less certain when it comes to framing decoloniality as a means (i.e. using decoloniality for and in the context of tackling various social and ecological issues) versus framing it as an end (i.e. decoloniality as undoing the colonially rooted systemic oppression and the aim of repatriation and restitution of indigenous lands). While the former may not directly obstruct the latter, it does not by default support it either. As Tuck and Young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2012</xref>) convincingly argue, using decoloniality argument for advancing various societal and political agendas and aims&#8212;regardless how benevolent they might be&#8212;can be harmful as it shifts the attention from the key point and aim, that is ending the colonial oppression and violence and repatriation of indigenous lands. In this context, the importance of remaining vigilant to numerous attempts to co-opt and reduce the radical ideas and political agendas of decoloniality cannot be overstated. Strengthening alliances among decolonial, postcolonial and degrowth scholars and activists is an important step towards the right direction, providing that dismantling the system of cultural and political violence of colonialism is an important part of their political projects and ideas.</p>
