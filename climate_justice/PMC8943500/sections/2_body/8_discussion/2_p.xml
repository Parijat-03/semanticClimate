Following the articles in this special issue, we may add that language manifests power. The last two decades, the United Nations and especially UNESCO have successfully developed multiple policy documents, declarations and action plans which all address the important global issue of how to ensure a sustainable future. This paradigm leans on concepts such as sustainable development, the four dimensions of sustainable development and transformative education. The <italic>Agenda 2030</italic> adds global objectives for guiding the process. All together these documents represent new knowledge. Although ECEC teachers for many years have worked with children on environmental education, the new paradigm often appears difficult to understand and to implement.</p>
