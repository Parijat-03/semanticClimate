<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In addition to the social media and forum data that we downloaded, we also held online focus group discussions with members of the British public to explore views on plastics and packaging and to generate spoken language data to be included in the corpus. We ran five focus groups in total, involving 28 participants: three of the focus groups were recruited using participants from a previous experiment run by our psychologist colleagues on the MHR project, who had consented to being contacted about future experiments; and&#160;the other two were recruited using a combination of online calls for participation via environmentally oriented, UK-based Facebook groups (e.g. &#8216;Zero-Waste London&#8217;, &#8216;Sustainable Lifestyle UK&#8217;) and a call via the mailing list of one of our environmental charity project partners, City to Sea. As such, the first three focus groups involved members of the public who do not explicitly identify as being pro-environmental, and the final two involved those who do. The transcripts of the five focus group recordings were added to the social media and forum data to complete Corpus 2. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_tab_002" ref-type="table">Table&#160;2</xref> shows the final Corpus 2 composition.</p>
