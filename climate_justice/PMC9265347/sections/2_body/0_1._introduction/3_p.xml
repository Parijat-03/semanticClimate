In this context, large-scale school-based programmes may be useful as school attendance is mandatory in most countries, and programmes promoting climate awareness and action in schools could thus reach a substantial proportion of young people. School-based programmes have the potential to increase knowledge about the climate crisis, empower students to become change agents and thus provide a basis for them to initiate and contribute to meaningful climate action [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

However, despite its greater implementation within school curricula, current efforts have fallen short in Germany and elsewhere [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
