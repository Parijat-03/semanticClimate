<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To illustrate possible use of the framework, we tested selected guiding questions on the Austrian Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan document [<xref rid="B69-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] as the Austrian strategy has been identified as a good contribution to health protection from climate change [<xref rid="B46-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Only one question for each domain was asked here to keep the case study brief for information purposes. In a &#8220;real world&#8221; case study, the example questions listed here would be adapted to specific contexts and evaluation aims. In addition, as stated above, not all questions can be adequately answered using a document analysis approach. Further tests in actual adaptation projects and the use of expert information are needed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="healthcare-04-00065-t003">Table 3</xref> summarizes our case assessment.</p>
