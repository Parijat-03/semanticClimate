In 2007 the then-State Environmental Protection Agency, PBoC and China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) issued opinions on &#8216;Implementing Environmental Protection Policies and Rules and Preventing Credit Risks&#8217; (SEPA/PBoC/CBRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2007</xref>). This document explained that &#8216;increased credit risk caused by the closure of polluting enterprises has seriously affected social stability and economic security&#8217; (par. 1). It requires government environmental protection departments at various levels to furnish financial departments with information on both polluting enterprises and &#8216;environment-friendly&#8217; enterprises (par. 3). Financial institutions must &#8216;exercise strict control&#8217; over credit allocation based on this information and on state environmental regulations (par. 2). In 2012, the CBRC issued &#8216;Green Credit Guidelines&#8217;, which regulate &#8216;banking financial institutions&#8217; in greater detail (CBRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>, art. 2). Under the Green Credit Guidelines, banks improved both their environmental and financial performance as they became &#8216;active with regard to integrating environmental risks into their credit risk assessment procedures&#8217; (Weber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2016</xref>, 3&#8211;4).</p>
