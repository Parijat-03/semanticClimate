<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The methodology has a number of strengths. It selects three relevant indices that can be used for assessing heat vulnerability: both because of their specific sets of indicators and spatial analysis approach and because of their alignment with public policy initiatives. It provides a very clear and systematic review of each indicator and an elegant way of comparing across all three. The analysis of which census tracts are/are not indicated as vulnerable in each of the three indices comes across in a compelling way. Most of the maps and graphs are clear and help make the paper&#8217;s argument in a compelling way. Their analysis of the differences in identifying vulnerable to heat risks can have significant policy impacts and implications for distribution of public funding. The article is very timely as billions of dollars of public investments in California to address health issues related to climate change and other environmental hazard are being made based on the designation of vulnerable communities. On the note of policy, figure 5 provides a very useful critique of AB 1550 by showing the minor degree of change in climate investments since its passage.</p>
