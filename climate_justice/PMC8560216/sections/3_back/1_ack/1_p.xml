We also thank Julian Virag, the podcast producer, and Kasidy Martin, the social media content coordinator who have been critical to the day-to-day operations and outreach. We express our gratitude to peer support groups&#8212;including Women of Color Podcasters and She Podcasts&#8212;for being a source of information, comfort, and inspiration.</p>
