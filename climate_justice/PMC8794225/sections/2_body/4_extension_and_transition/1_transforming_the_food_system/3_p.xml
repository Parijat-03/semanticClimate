At worst, 1862 Extension programs subsidize corporate agriculture, and historically helped to consolidate a small but influential group of overwhelmingly white farmers who understand their interests as aligned with the corporate food system and who lobby against regulation and alternatives (Patel and Goodman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>). Clark et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>) found that Extension educators working in alternative food systems focused mainly on including excluded groups into the current market-oriented system. Using Stevenson et al.&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2007</xref>) formulation, they contend that Extension educators are pragmatic &#8220;builders&#8221; of local projects and networking &#8220;weavers,&#8221; but rarely &#8220;warriors&#8221; for food system transformation, citing a lack of resources, alliances, and administrative support to pursue structural changes, as well as a unifying frame.</p>
