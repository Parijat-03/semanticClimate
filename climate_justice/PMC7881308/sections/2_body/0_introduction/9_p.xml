Research related to clinical best practices undertaken as part of the planning for implementation of the Monash Clinical Guarantee has shaped the programme&#8217;s response to the pandemic. The article then considers a range of issues generated by Monash&#8217;s move to virtual delivery of client services and the clinic&#8217;s teaching programme. The article concludes with contemplation of how clinical programmes can best plan for &#8216;the new normal&#8217; that will present itself after the pandemic.</p>
