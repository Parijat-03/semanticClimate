It is envisaged to install more bulk flow meters at strategic locations in transmission mains and survey conducted for remaining bulk meters from carrying out water audit at micro level.  Further, district meter areas (DMA&#8217;s) are being formed to assess the inflow and outflow of water from a particular area.  39 DMA&#8217;s have been selected for water auditing at micro level and 61 DMA&#8217;s more have been identified.
