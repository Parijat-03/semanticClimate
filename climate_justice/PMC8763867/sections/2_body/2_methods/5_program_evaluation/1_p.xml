<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We assessed the program's acceptability and impact on participants&#8217; attitudes towards community organizing through a postworkshop survey (<xref rid="s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix F</xref>). We emailed the online survey instrument to participants 5 months after the workshop. In the survey, we asked participants to rate their level of agreement with a number of positive evaluative statements based on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = <italic toggle="yes">strongly disagree,</italic> 5 = <italic toggle="yes">strongly agree</italic>). These statements assessed the acceptability of the program as well as the degree to which it accomplished our stated objectives. We also collected qualitative data from free-text responses to questions pertaining to these objectives. To analyze these free-text responses, one author (Eleanor H. Emery) performed directed content analysis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> that was subsequently reviewed by two additional authors (Gaurab Basu and Danny McCormick). The authors then met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies to obtain consensus.</p>
