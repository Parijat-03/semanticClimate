<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We included nine potential variables to consider the effects of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, wildfires, and wildfire&#8208;induced air pollution on human mobility and recreation behaviors at public parks. These variables were accessed and processed from multiple sources (see details in Table&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic situations, we accessed the county&#8208;level outbreak and death data in each month of June&#8211;September from USAFacts (<ext-link xlink:href="https://usafacts.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://usafacts.org/</ext-link>) and standardized them into the incidence and death rates, respectively (case number per total population). For the wildfire effects, we considered wildfire events, toxic gases, and smoke levels. The wildland fire location data set was accessed from National Interagency Fire Center. We screened any wildfire events that occurred and lasted for at least a week within each of June&#8211;September and computed the Euclidean distance to the closest wildfire events (Fire distance) and the density of wildfires (Fire density) over the study area using ArcMap 10.8. Smoke observations were downloaded from Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Product at NOAA. Given that the smoke was measured every 5&#160;min, we extracted the daily maximum and minimum smoke values and then aggregated them to monthly scale. The toxic gases were directly accessed from the data sources.</p>
