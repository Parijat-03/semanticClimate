      <td>situations, for example, if the dependence between the variables is not well-simulated, univariate bias adjustment of the individual\nvariables may increase biases in the resulting indicator (Zscheischler et al., 2019). A simple alternative would be a bias adjustment of\nthe indicator, but such a procedure may substantially alter the climate change signal, in particular for extreme events (Casanueva et al.,\n2018). In principle, multivariate bias adjustment methods are good to adjust all statistical aspects of the multivariate distribution that they\nintend to adjust. Depending on the method, this includes the correlation structure or even broader aspects of the dependence (Cannon,\n2016, 2018; Vrac, 2018; Fran&#231;ois et al., 2020). If multivariate adjustment includes a spatial dimension, then spatial dependence is adjusted\nwell (Vrac, 2018), but care is needed when applied across large areas (Fran&#231;ois et al., 2020). Adjustment of multivariate dependence\nnecessarily modifies the temporal sequencing of the driving model (Cannon, 2016; Maraun, 2016). The extent of the modification depends\non the chosen method and the number of variables to adjust (Vrac and Friederichs, 2015; Cannon, 2016; Vrac, 2018; Fran&#231;ois et al., 2020).</td>

      <td>bias-adjustment methods. Dobor and Hl&#225;sny (2019) found a considerable influence of the choice of the observational dataset and\ncalibration period on the adjustment for some regions. RCM biases are typically larger than observational uncertainties, but in some\nregions, and in particular for wet-day frequencies, spatial patterns and the intensity distribution of daily precipitation, the situation\nmay reverse (Kotlarski et al., 2019). Switanek et al. (2017) found a strong influence of internal variability and thus of the choice of\ncalibration period on the calibration of quantile mapping and on the modification of the climate change signal.</td>

      <td>Bias adjustment is typically evaluated using cross-validation, that is, by calibrating the adjustment function to one period of the observational\nrecord, and by evaluating it on a different one. Maraun et al. (2017) and Maraun and Widmann (2018a) demonstrated that, in the presence\nof multi-decadal internal variability, cross-validation may lead to a rejection of a valid bias adjustment or even lead to a positive evaluation\nof an invalid adjustment. The authors therefore argued that, in the presence of substantial internal variability, the evaluation of bias\nadjustment requires to consider aspects that have not been adjusted, such as temporal, spatial, or multivariable dependence.</td>

      <td>Ehret et al. (2012) and IPCC (2015) propose to at least provide the raw model output alongside the adjusted data. Maraun et al. (2017)\nargue that the target resolution should be similar to the model resolution to avoid downscaling issues. IPCC (2015) and Maraun et al.\n(2017) highlighted the relevance of understanding model biases and the misrepresentations of the underlying physical processes prior to\nany adjustment. Together with Galmarini et al. (2019), they point out the need for collaboration between bias adjustment users, experts in\nclimate modelling and experts in the considered regional climate. As new research avenues, development of process-oriented bias adjustment\nmethods (Addor et al., 2016; Verfaillie et al., 2017; Manzanas and Guti&#233;rrez, 2019) or run-time bias adjustment integrated into the climate\nsimulation, for example, to reduce circulation errors (Guldberg et al., 2005; Kharin et al., 2012; Krinner et al., 2019, 2020) are proposed.</td>
