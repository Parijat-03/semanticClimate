Pinatubo on the Philippines; such an eruption might cause\na global surface cooling of a few tenths of a degree Celsius lasting several years. Second, both atmosphere and\nocean show variations that occur spontaneously, without any external influence. These variations range from\nlocalized weather systems to continent- and ocean-wide patterns and oscillations that change over months, years,\nor decades. Over a period of twenty years, natural climate variability strongly influences many climate quantities,\nwhen compared to the response to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities. The effect\nof natural variability is illustrated by the very different trajectories that individual black, red or blue lines can\ntake in FAQ 4.1, Figure 1. Whether natural variability would amplify or attenuate the human influence cannot\ngenerally be predicted out to twenty years into the future.
