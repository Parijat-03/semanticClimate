This trend 7 is more prevalent over the mountainous region than in valleys and lowlands and during the pre-monsoon 8 season than for the rest of the year. A consistent higher increasing trend for warm days (13 days per decade) 9 than for warm nights (4 days per decade) is observed, whereas the rates of decrease for cold days and cold 10 nights are the same (6 days per decade). Less snowfall and cloud coverage are attributed for this trend, which 11 cause positive geopotential height anomalies and strengthens the anticyclonic circulations in the mid-to-12 upper troposphere. The winter cooling is attributed to the stable lower atmosphere causing prolonged and 13 frequent periods of fog over lowlands regions (Karki et al., 2019). 14 15 Figure Atlas.49: shows changes and trends relative to 1980&#8211;2014 period in temperature (a) and precipitation 16 (b) from three different data sets over south and central Asia that covers the HKH region. There is a 17 widespread significant warming trend over the HKH, especially in the Tibetan Plateau, of about 0.3&#8211;0.4&#176;C 18 per decade.  Changes in precipitation, however, are less spatially coherent with a mix of decreasing and 19 increasing trends in rainfall over the region that are not statistically significant. 20 21 22 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 494.45; y1: 505.43; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="494.45" x1="273.3">Atlas.5.10.1.3 Assessment of model performance </span><span x0="27.66" y0="494.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 494.45; y1: 505.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23 The CMIP5 models used in IPCC AR5 were able to simulate the 20th century mean annual cycles of 24 temperature and precipitation in the eastern and western Himalayan sub-regions within the HKH (Panday et 25 al., 2015). However these coarse resolution global models showed large spread in capturing the weather 26 station based observational precipitation regimes as they were not able to resolve fine-scale processes and 27 represent the complex topography in the western Himalayas. Hence these climate models could not 28 realistically simulate the reductions in mean annual temperature observed across stations in the western 29 Himalayas (Panday et al., 2015). As the horizontal resolution of GCMs increased to ~50km, the spatial 30 pattern of rainfall along the southern edge of the Himalayas became more realistic and the overestimation of 31 light rainfall over the Tibetan Plateau also reduced (Li et al., 2016).  32 33 Higher resolution (50 km) dynamical downscaling in CORDEX over South Asia using regional climate 34 models (RCMs) with improved topographic representation of the HKH region are expected to better resolve 35 the complexities of the monsoon and other hydrological processes at regional scales. The CORDEX South 36 Asia multi-RCM ensemble does exceptionally well in capturing the spatial patterns of temperature 37 climatology over Himalayas for the present (Dimri et al., 2018b). These downscaled high resolution RCM 38 simulations were also able to show added value relative to their driving CMIP5 GCM simulations in a few 39 aspects for the HKH such as the spatial pattern of temperature during summer monsoon and winter season 40 and its changes over the Himalayan water towers in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra river basins 41 (Mishra, 2015c), and the climatology of temperature and precipitation seasonality over Himalayan 42 watersheds of the Indus basin (Hasson et al., 2019b).  Further, the CORDEX RCMs reliably capture the 43 overall increasing trend of surface temperature variations over the South Asian region (Sanjay et al., 2017a) 44 with varying magnitude across regions, seasons, averaging periods and scenarios. 45 46 CORDEX South Asia RCM simulations, however, still show cold bias when compared to the driving CMIP5 47 GCMs over the Himalayas water towers and tend to overestimate the total precipitation in the HKH sub-48 regions during the summer monsoon and winter seasons (Choudhary and Dimri, 2018; Ghimire et al., 2018; 49 Mishra, 2015; Nengker, T.; Choudhary, A.; Dimri, 2018; Sanjay et al., 2017). Over the Indus Basin (Jhelum, 50 Kabul and upper Indus basin), results showed that the downscaled RCMs and their driving CMIP5 51 experiments consistently feature low fidelity in terms of the chosen skill metrics, suggesting substantial cold 52 (6&#8211;10&#176;C) and wet (up to 80%) biases and underestimation of observed precipitation seasonality (Hasson et 53 al., 2019c) and showed uncertainty for far future climate projection under the RCP8.5 scenario. The biases of 54 both RCMs and of their driving CMIP5 GCMs were higher in magnitude than the projected changes under 55 </span></div></body></html>
