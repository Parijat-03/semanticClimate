<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As seen in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the United States (29%), European Union countries (22%), and China (12.7%) account for the largest cumulative amount of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions since the start of the industrial age in the mid-eighteenth century. Therefore, we anticipate that these three would be a major source of climate reparations financing, with the funds levied in accordance with their overall historical contributions to atmospheric emissions. Russia, Japan, and India are also among the top six CO<sub>2</sub> emitters historically, but on a much smaller scale, and would be levied proportionately less in their contributions to climate reparations.</p>
