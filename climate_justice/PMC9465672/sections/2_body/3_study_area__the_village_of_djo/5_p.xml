However, by the end of the dry season, they had to paddle to the neighboring village of Arame to fetch water from a well. Some artificial ponds provided cattle, goats, and pigs with drinking water for almost the whole dry season (see also Nogueira, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1947</xref>: 746). The roofing straw for their houses was usually harvested from a vacant upland territory that became theirs after the imposition by colonial authorities of forced labor to build and maintain the roads. According to interviewees from Djobel, Elia, Susana, and Elalab, this implied the establishment of village territories with fixed boundaries, even when the inhabitants lived on islands, as was the case for Djobel and Arame.</p>
