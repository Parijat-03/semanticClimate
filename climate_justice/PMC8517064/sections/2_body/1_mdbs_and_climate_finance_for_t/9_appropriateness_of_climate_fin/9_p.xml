The project includes a &#8220;component 0&#8221; aimed at disaster Risk Reduction and Management which enhances the flexibility of the financing. Component 0 allows PROCAVA to promptly react to weather extremes, facilitating the quick adoption of remedial actions construction of dykes, dams, or canals to manage flood water; and climate proofing infrastructure such as rural roads adaptation investments for natural disaster recovery. Component 0 is therefore a smart adaptive mechanism that will facilitate and allow faster processing (IFAD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>).</p>
