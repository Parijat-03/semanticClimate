<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We recruited 66 participants assuming a similar dropout rate to Study 1 (about 30% or greater, given the more effortful in-person tasks), aiming for an <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 40 final sample. This small sample (smaller than the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> prescribed by our power analysis for Study 1) seemed appropriate for a small pilot study with no planned comparison between two groups (experimental and baseline). 38 completed the full study (a 42% dropout rate). Recruitment was carried out as in Study 1, but this time the final reward amount was $150 per person to facilitate recruitment under pandemic conditions.</p>
