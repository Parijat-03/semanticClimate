<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The <em>ocean</em> region encircling Antarctica that connects the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans together, allowing inter-ocean exchange.</p>
<p>This region is the main source of much of the deep water of the world’s ocean and also provides the primary return pathway for this deep water to the surface (Marshall and Speer, 2012; Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995). The drawing up of deep waters and the subsequent transport into the ocean interior has major consequences for the global heat, nutrient and carbon balances, as well as the Antarctic <em>cryosphere</em> and marine <em>ecosystems</em>.</p>
