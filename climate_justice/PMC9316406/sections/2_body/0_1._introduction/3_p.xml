The critical reflection framework consists of three-level components, including micro-level: social work interventions that directly engage with service users (e.g., individuals, families, or small groups); mezzo-level: social work strategies that serve particular groups of clients at the agency and community levels (e.g., community-based social service agencies and community social development interventions); and macro-level: social work system-level approaches for advocacy, policymaking, and program development (e.g., social policy development and social work program design) [<xref rid="B7-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These three-level social work interventions encourage both authors to identify the essential capacities that green social workers need to develop through in-class and field education. Consequently, this article is guided by the research question: what are the critical GSW-driven components associated with micro-, mezzo-, and macro-level social work interventions pertaining to supporting and promoting the individual and collective health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities affected by extreme events?</p>
