We calculate a weighted combination of three interpretations (one from each equity cornerstone) with the sum of the weights of the three interpretations equal to 1. These weighted combinations are used to generate the ternary charts found in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; further charts for all countries can be found in the Supplementary Information, section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>.</p>
