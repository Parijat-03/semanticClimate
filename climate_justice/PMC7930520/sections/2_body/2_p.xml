Bessant describes a relational approach, after Bourdieu, as emphasising the &#8216;mutual relations between &#8220;words&#8221; and &#8220;things&#8221; that are produced by intellectual practices&#8217; (p. 12). For Bessant, common sense representations of the child and young person&#8217;s political potential are inextricable from the work of &#8216;experts, intellectuals, writers, journalists, [and] policy makers&#8217; whose work serves to &#8216;&#8220;make up&#8221; certain kinds of people&#8217; (p. 6). These adult experts and professionals do not simply describe &#8216;children&#8217; and &#8216;youth&#8217;, and groups within these broad categories, but their social representations <italic>constitute</italic> those &#8216;<italic>types</italic> of people&#8217; and inform how those people &#8216;come to understand themselves, how they respond to those representations and how they act in the world&#8217; (p. 9, Bessant&#8217;s emphasis). In Chapter 1, Bessant carefully argues the need for a clearly articulated theory of social representations; analysing the constitutive power of &#8216;expert&#8217; representations of a group (such as young people) supports understanding of how and why official &#8216;knowledge&#8217; about a group often &#8216;does not align with how those being researched and talked about experience their own lives and understand themselves&#8217; (p. 39).</p>
