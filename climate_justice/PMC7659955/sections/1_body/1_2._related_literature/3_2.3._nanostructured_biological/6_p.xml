<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By adopting bio-sensors in the detection of soil nutrients and fertilizers, Ali et al. [<xref rid="B29-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] revealed that soil nitrates can be detected using a system that relies on microfluidic impedimetric sensing. The unit works by adopting nano-sheets of graphene oxide and the nanofibers of the so-called poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). The researchers showed that poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composite can bear the enzyme; nitrate reductase, and also measure the amount of nitrate ions in soil samples on which sweet corn was cultivated. This is done at 0.44-442 mg/L concentration, so the detection limit was 0.135 mg/L [<xref rid="B29-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Carrying out the procedure, however, involves sample drying at 105 &#176;C, and subsequent nitrate extraction through the addition of 2 M KCl solution. The mixture was shaken for 60 min, and filtered using Whatman filter paper. Finally, sample extraction was kept in a syringe for infusion into the experimental device.</p>
