<p>In relation to the theme of connectedness, using technology for social good is a contemporary
challenge. We have discussed the pre-existing digital &#8216;disparities&#8217; (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Rigney, 2017</xref>) that have resurfaced during the pandemic for
individuals and communities. Working at the meta-level creates opportunities for social workers
to forge new alliances, coalitions and networks for broader social change. Information and
communication technology (ICT) such as digital media expand spaces for socio-political
networking and collective forms of advocacy to respond to issues affecting communities locally,
regionally and internationally (see <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Lynch, 2020</xref>). In
the classroom, we seek to incorporate examples of social workers undertaking advocacy across
international borders on a range of global social issues such as child sex trafficking.</p>
