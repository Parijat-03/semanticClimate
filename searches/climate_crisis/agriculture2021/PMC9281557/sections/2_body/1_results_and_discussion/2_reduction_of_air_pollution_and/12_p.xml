Forster et al.<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> estimate that the pandemic-driven response's direct effect will be negligible, with cooling off around 0.01&#160;&#177;&#160;0.005&#176;C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with green economic and fossil fuel investments reduction, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3&#176;C by 2050.</p>
