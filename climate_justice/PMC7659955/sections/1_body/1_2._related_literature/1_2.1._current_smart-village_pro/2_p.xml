<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The IEEE smart village program is one of the most popular today. It has a goal of advancing education in off-grid societies, and fostering sustainability in the entire value chain of the smart village energy sector. Initially taking off as an initiative that seeks to provide community solutions in 2009, the current name was coined 5 years later. The IEEE smart village plan is a global initiative, touching lives in Asia, some parts of North America, and mostly in Africa [<xref rid="B1-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], through the promotion of smart energy production in rural areas, and is mostly financed through fundraising. Major efforts that were developed from the initiative include the so-called SunBlazer II&#8212;a movable power base solar station [<xref rid="B11-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; &#8220;Learning beyond the Light Bulb&#8221; [<xref rid="B12-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]&#8212;a program aimed at training locals on the development and design of off-grid solar electricity panels and fostering its sustainability and scalability. As reported by Zavratnik [<xref rid="B10-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the program also comes with a remote study event that runs for about nine months, and allows practice exchange amongst involved communities, for knowledge sharing and skill enhancement. </p>
