Land-atmosphere interactions involving soil moisture-atmosphere 3 feedbacks are shown to be able to amplify temperature and precipitation anomalies in Central Europe, 4 suggesting that global warming can increase the probability of large scale precipitation deficits (Vogel et al., 5 2018). Gudmundsson and Seneviratne (2015) show a gradient in trends of (particularly multi-annual) 6 droughts across Europe, with a decreasing trend in Northern Europe and increasing trends in the South. 7 However, a formal attribution of European droughts to global warming has not been documented. 8 9 The increasing trend in surface shortwave radiation, documented in AR5 to have occurred since the 1980s 10 and referred to as a brightening effect, is substantiated over Europe and the Mediterranean region (Nabat et 11 al., 2014; Sanchez</span><span x0="137.28" y0="633.65" x1="140.93" style="x0: 137.28; x1: 140.93; y0: 633.65; y1: 644.63; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCOK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">&#8208;</span><span x0="140.94" y0="633.65" x1="41.44" style="x0: 140.94; x1: 147.65; y0: 633.65; y1: 644.63; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Lorenzo et al., 2015). This increasing trend has been attributed to the decrease in 12 anthropogenic sulphate aerosols over the 1980&#8211;2012 period (Nabat et al., 2014). In model sensitivity 13 experiments, the aerosol trend has been quantified to explain 81 &#177; 16% of the European surface shortwave 14 trend and 23 &#177; 5% of the European surface temperature warming.  15 16 To support climatological analyses and model evaluation, national meteorological and hydrological services 17 are increasingly making available high spatial and temporal resolution gridded and in situ homogenized and 18 quality-checked datasets. The inclusion of additional station data lead to a better representation of extreme 19 precipitation statistics than the global-scale CRU or continental-scale E-OBS datasets. For example, in 20 Norway a 1km gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset is available from 1957 to the present 21 (Lussana et al., 2018). Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the Carpathians also boast 22 gridded observation-based datasets at resolution of 2 to 25 km (D&#233;qu&#233; and Somot, 2008; Vidal et al., 2010; 23 Rauthe et al., 2013; No&#235;l et al., 2015; Spinoni et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2016; Ruti et al., 2016; Fantini et 24 al., 2018). Recent gridded products merging radar and station data allow to reach higher spatial and temporal 25 resolutions (Tabary et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2016; Fumi&#232;re et al., 2019). Spatial pooling of climate change 26 signals enhances the statistical robustness of the observed and projected trends (Fischer et al., 2013). 27 28 While the emergence of very high-resolution observation-based gridded datasets does provide additional 29 information for climate assessments and model evaluation, a number of caveats exists. The gridded European 30 datasets are unreliable over data-sparse regions. Also, many datasets employ different approaches to 31 interpolation and gridding, which adds to their uncertainty and complicates comparative evaluations 32 (Kotlarski et al., 2017; Berthou et al., 2018; Fantini et al., 2018). For example, differences between different 33 precipitation datasets have been shown to be of the same magnitude as errors in regional climate models 34 (Prein et al., 2016; Prein and Gobiet, 2017; Fantini et al., 2018). 35 36 37 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 304.73; y1: 315.71; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="304.73" x1="266.23">Atlas.5.6.3 Assessment of model performance </span><span x0="27.66" y0="304.73" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 304.73; y1: 315.71; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">38 39 Regional climate models driven by reanalysis have been extensively evaluated regarding a range of climate 40 features over Europe and the Mediterranean (Casanueva et al., 2016; Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Ivanov et 41 al., 2017; Krakovska et al., 2017; Terzago et al., 2017; Cavicchia et al., 2018; Drobinski et al., 2018; Fantini 42 et al., 2018; Harzallah et al., 2018; Panthou et al., 2018b). Standard assessments of RCMs, typically run at 43 12&#8211; 25 km spatial resolution, confirm that the Euro-CORDEX and Med-CORDEX ensembles are capable of 44 reproducing the salient features of European climate, corresponding to the ENSEMBLES simulations 45 (Kotlarski et al., 2014; Krakovska, 2018). They have been shown to be able to represent realistically 46 circulation features such as coastal low-level jet (over Portugal, (Cardoso et al., 2016), medicanes (Gaertner 47 et al., 2018), Mediterranean cyclones (Flaounas et al., 2018; Sanchez-Gomez and Somot, 2018), cyclonic 48 activity in high latitudes including Northern Europe (Shkolnik and Efimov, 2013), characteristics of heating 49 periods (Krakovska et al., 2019) and intensity, direction and inland penetration of the sea breeze (south of 50 France, (Drobinski et al., 2018).  51 52 RCMs run at 12 km generally show similar area-averaged, seasonal mean features compared to coarser-scale 53 simulations (with GCMs and lower-resolution RCMs). However, higher-resolution simulations do show 54 improved performance in reproducing the spatial patterns and seasonal cycle of mean precipitation over all 55 </span></div></body></html>
