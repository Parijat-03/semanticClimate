He concluded that Germany&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions declined mainly because of energy intensity and carbon intensity. He also noted that a relatively small population growth rate also helped the country to reduce the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the present study, however, the impacts of five factors on Australia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were analyzed (an additional factor was the energy structure), concluding that only energy intensity substantially reduced the amount of emissions during the studied period. Contrasting with Germany&#8217;s results, carbon intensity had a minor accelerating impact on Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Furthermore, due to the very slow transformation of Australia&#8217;s energy matrix from non-renewable to renewable, the energy structure had only a minor impact on the country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Australia&#8217;s population growth was relatively higher than Germany&#8217;s; thus, the population effect significantly increased emissions in Australia.</p>
