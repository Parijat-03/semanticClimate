For instance, land-use planning would guide current and future decision-making and planners in exploring uncertainty to increase the resilience of communities (Berke and Stevens 2016). One of the important policy implications for enhanced food security are the trade-offs between agricultural production and environmental concerns, including the asserted need for global land-use expansion, biodiversity and ecological restoration (Meyfroidt 2017) (Section&#160;5.6).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="603.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="603.54" x1="313.23">There are a&#160;number of adaptation options in agriculture in the form of policy, planning, governance and institutions (Lorenz 2017). For example, early spatial planning action is crucial to guide decision-making processes and foster resilience in highly uncertain future climate change (Brunner and Gr&#234;t-Regamey, 2016). Institutions may develop new capacities to empower value chain actors, take climate change into account as they develop quality products, promote adoption of improved diet for healthier lifestyles, aid the improvement of livelihoods of communities, and further socioeconomic development (Sehmi et al. 2016). Other adaptation policies include property rights and land tenure security as legal and institutional reforms to ensure transparency and access to land that could stimulate adaptation to climate change (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="171.16" top="435.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 435.42; y1: 445.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="435.42" x1="171.16">1.3.5.1 Global initiatives </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="411.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.3; y0: 411.52; y1: 421.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="411.52" x1="313.27">Climate change poses serious wide-ranging risks, requiring a&#160;broader approach in &#64257;ghting the phenomenon.

The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) programme under the UNFCCC was established to: identify vulnerable regions; assess the impacts of climate change on food security; and prioritise adaptation measures for implementation to increase resilience. The National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) was also established to support least-developed countries (LDCs) in addressing their particular challenges in adaptation, to enhance food security among other priorities. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="243.55"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 243.55; y1: 253.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="243.55" x1="313.23">The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) is a&#160;major victory for small island states and vulnerable nations that face climate change-related impacts of &#64258;oods and droughts resulting in food security challenges.
