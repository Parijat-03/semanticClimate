<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We need lots of support across society to care for youth mental health through the climate crisis. This includes individuals, families, communities, services (designed by communities) and policies to support mental health. There are people we can see to talk about mental health issues, but climate anxiety is not considered a mental health issue by the general public. It is hard to support people whose mental health is affected by climate change &#8211; you cannot just say &#8216;everything is going to get better&#8217;, because it is not. We can only really talk to people who understand it. There are not enough appropriate mental health services to support young people, especially in regional areas, and mainstream services are not suited to all young people.</p>
