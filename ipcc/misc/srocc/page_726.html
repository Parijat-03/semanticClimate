Supporting the study of enabling environments, the study of policy mixes has emerged in the last decade in regards to the mix or set of instruments that interact together and are aimed at achieving policy objectives in a&#160;dynamic setting (Reichardt et al. 2015). This includes studying the ultimate objectives of a&#160;policy mix&#160;&#8211; such as biodiversity (Ring and Schr&#246;ter-Schlaack 2011)&#160;&#8211; the interaction of policy instruments within the mix (including climate change mitigation and energy (del R&#237;o and Cerd&#225; 2017)) (see Trade-offs and synergies, Section&#160;7.5.6), and the dynamic nature of the policy mix (Kern and Howlett 2009).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="531.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 531.55; y1: 541.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="531.55" x1="307.57">Studying policy mixes allows for a&#160;consideration of policy coherence that is broader than the study of discrete policy instruments in rigidly de&#64257;ned sectors, but entails studying policy in relation to the links and dependencies among problems and issues (FAO 2017b). Consideration of policy coherence is a&#160;new approach, rejecting simplistic solutions, but acknowledging inherently complex processes involving collective consideration of public and private actors in relation to policy analysis (FAO 2017b). A coherent, consistent mix of policy instruments can solve complex policy problems (Howlett and Rayner 2013) as it involves lateral, integrative, and holistic thinking in de&#64257;ning and solving problems (FAO 2017b). Such a&#160;consideration of policy coherence is required to achieve sustainable development (FAO 2017b; Bierbaum and Cowie 2018). Consideration of policy coherence potentially addresses three sets of challenges: challenges that exist with assessing multiple hazards and sectors (Aalto et al. 2017; Brander and Keith 2015; Williams and Abatzoglou 2016); challenges in mainstreaming adaptation and risk management into ongoing development planning and decision-making (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler 2015); and challenges in scaling-up community and ecosystem-based initiatives in countries overly focused on sectors, instead of sustainable use of biodiversity and ES (Reid 2016). There is a&#160;gap in integrated consideration of adaptation, mitigation, climate change policy and development. A study in Indonesia found that, while internal policy coherence between mitigation and adaptation is increasing, external policy coherence between climate change policy and development objectives is still required (Di Gregorio et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="91.93" top="207.59"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="207.59" x1="91.93">There is </span><span style="x0: 94.46; x1: 101.32; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="94.46" y0="207.59" x1="162.39">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 164.92; x1: 169.32; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="164.92" y0="207.59" x1="180.75">and </span><span style="x0: 183.27; x1: 187.85; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="183.27" y0="207.59" x1="244.88">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 247.41; x1: 250.22; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="247.41" y0="207.59" x1="307.56">that a&#160;suite of agricultural business risk programmes (which would include crop insurance and income stability programmes) increase farm &#64257;nancial performance, reduce risk, and also reinforce incentives to adopt stewardship practices (bene&#64257;cial management practices) improving the environment (Jeffrey et al. 2017). Consideration of the portfolio of instruments responding to climate change and its associated risks, and the interaction of policy instruments, improve agricultural producer livelihoods (Hurlbert 2018b). In relation to hazards, or climate-related extremes (Section&#160;7.4.3), the policy mix has been found to be a&#160;key determinant of the adaptive capacity of agricultural producers.

The policy coherence between climate policy and public &#64257;nanceis critical in ensuring the ef&#64257;ciency, effectiveness and equity of mitigation policy, and ultimately to make stringent mitigation policy more feasible (Siegmeier et al. 2018).

Such barriers to climate action help determine the degree to which society can achieve its sustainable development objectives (Dow et al. 2013; Langholtz et al. 2014; Klein et al. 2015). However, some policies can also be seen as being designed speci&#64257;cally to overcome barriers, while some cases may actually create or strengthen barriers to climate action (Foudi and Erdlenbruch 2012; Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler 2015). The concept of barriers to climate action is used here in a&#160;sense close to that of &#8216;soft limits&#8217; to adaptation (Klein, et al. 2014). &#8216;Hard limits&#8217; by contrast are seen as primarily biophysical. Predicted changes in the key factors of crop growth and productivity&#160;&#8211; temperature, water, and soil quality&#160;&#8211; are expected to pose limits to adaptation in ways that affect the world population&#8217;s ability to get enough food in the future (Altieri et al. 2015; Altieri and Nicholls 2017).</span></div></body></html>
