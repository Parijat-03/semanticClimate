Previously, it was known as 2019-nCoV and caused disease mainly through respiratory pathways. The COVID-19 outbreak is ranked third globally as the most highly pathogenic disease of the twenty-first century, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic methodology have been demonstrated in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published regarding the integration of COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. Accordingly, this review systematically addresses environmental aspects of COVID-19 outbreak such as the origin of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic methodology, treatment options and technological advancement for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks. Finally, we integrate COVID-19 outbreaks (monitoring, fate and treatment) with environmental and human health perspectives. We believe that this review will help to understand the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a multipurpose document, not only for the scientific community but also for global citizens. Countries should adopt emergency preparedness such as prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19 as the virus spreads rapidly globally.", "affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Sukanta Mahavidyalaya, University of North Bengal, Dhupguri 735210, West Bengal, India. samanta.palas2010@gmail.com.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["review-article", "Review", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Disease Outbreaks"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Epidemiological characteristics", "Public Health", "Emergency Preparedness", "Covid-19", "Sars-cov-2 Virus", "Environmental Perspectives"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i35.5822"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8475003"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8475003?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "2", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "gen"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2021-10-12", "dateOfCreation": "2021-10-11", "firstIndexDate": "2021-10-12", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-10-11", "dateOfRevision": "2021-10-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-09-01"}
