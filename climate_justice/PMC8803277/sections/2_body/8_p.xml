Relinquishing our commitment to social and ecological justice contributes to a pernicious tendency, by members of the public, politicians, and indeed many within our public health communities, to conflate health and healthcare, and to fail to make the connection between health and its broader contexts and determinants (The Lancet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>; McLaren &amp; Hennessy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). We invite, and indeed plead for, broader discussion from and with our communities around &#8220;equity-focused and decolonizing public health actions that prevent, mitigate, and recover from climate and other ecological impacts in ways that promote health and sustainability from community to planetary levels&#8221; (Canadian Journal of Public Health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">n.d.</xref>).</p>
