Grazing lands across dryland environments are being degraded, and/or being converted to crop production, limiting the opportunities for migratory livestock systems, and leading to con&#64258;icts with sedentary crop producers (Abbass 2014; Dimelu et al. 2016).

For comparison, the average share of global population living in extreme poverty is about 10% (World Bank 2018). Multidimensional poverty, prevalent in many dryland areas, is a&#160;key source of vulnerability (Safriel et al. 2005; Thornton et al. 2014; Fraser et al. 2011; Thomas 2008). Multidimensional poverty incorporates both income-based poverty, and also other dimensions such as poor healthcare services, lack of education, lack of access to water, sanitation and energy,&#160;disempowerment, and threat from violence (Bourguignon and Chakravarty 2003; Alkire and Santos 2010, 2014). Contributing elements to this multidimensional poverty in drylands are rapid population growth, fragile institutional environment, lack of infrastructure, geographic isolation and low market access, insecure land tenure systems, and low agricultural productivity (Sietz et al. 2011; Reynolds et al. 2011; Safriel and Adeel 2008; Stafford Smith 2016). Even in high-income countries, those dryland areas that depend on agricultural livelihoods represent relatively poorer locations nationally, with fewer livelihood opportunities, for example in Italy (Salvati 2014). Moreover, in many drylands areas, female-headed households, women and subsistence farmers (both male and female) are more vulnerable to the impacts of deserti&#64257;cation and climate change (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr 2015; Sultana 2014; Rahman 2013).
