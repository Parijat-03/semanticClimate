Between 1990 and 2017, Australia&#8217;s population increased from 17.1 to 24.6 million (World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Therefore, in all years of the research period, the population effect raised Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. From 1990 to 2017, the population effect increased country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by an average of 4974.1 ktons each year. Among the three factors that raised the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Australia, the population effect was the second largest and its share in the total emissions was calculated as 96.9% for 2017.</p>
