In 2020 and 2021, meat-processing facilities became hotspots for COVID-19 infections and deaths in the United States, Brazil, and Germany. In the United States, the Trump administration forfeited its role in enforcing COVID-19 worker safety measures, deemed meat processing an essential activity, and left personal protective equipment, social distancing, masking, hand washing, and testing to the processors. Despite protestations that worker safety was their top priority, including in a statement by Cargill that acknowledged the &#8220;tragic impacts&#8221; of COVID-19, most of the big producers&#8212;for example, Tyson, JBS, Smithfield, and Cargill&#8212;were slow to act on providing personal protective equipment, social distancing protocols, sanitary measures, and testing.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
