This approach can be seen, for example, in the declaration of the 2004 Conference on Environmental Justice and Climate Change (Climate Justice Declaration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). However, while climate justice&#8217;s meaning may appear self-evident when stated in these terms, both academic literature and political debate reveal it to be contested. Different approaches are informed by competing political and economic schools of thought, as well as different communities within which climate justice is sought (e.g. national communities, the international community, humanity including future generations and nature in general).</p>
