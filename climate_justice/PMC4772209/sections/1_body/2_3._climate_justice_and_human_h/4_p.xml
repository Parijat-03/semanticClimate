McMichael argued that, in addition to large-scale and systemic environmental factors (such as those associated with climate change), demographic and social factors <italic>(i.e</italic>., population growth, aging, family structures) and economic activity (<italic>i.e</italic>., wealth creation and distribution and financial status and health care) impact human population health [<xref rid="B81-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. While environmental factors&#8212;for example, increased foodborne illnesses and waterborne diseases and the depletion of drinking water resources&#8212;are the most obvious linkage between climate change and human health, demographic and economic factors also come into play. Human health quality and access to care are directly related to socioeconomic and geographical status [<xref rid="B81-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. </p>
