Due to reductions in transport and economic activities, recent updated estimates suggest that global emissions fell during 2020 by 5.4% in comparison to 2019 (<xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2021</xref>). While profound, this is less than the drop initially projected by experts (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2020</xref>). It is also less than the 7.6% emission reductions, which are required each year over the next 10&#8239;years to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement while sustaining economic development (<xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2019b</xref>).</p>
