Public as well as private spaces have been turned into display areas for the messages of numerous associations and groups. Recent debates have transformed the city into a&#160;large protest space, which the residents use to communicate what they see as their right to reappropriate urban space (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Public space as protest space, 2017 (photo by Janine Schemmer)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="48_2022_340_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e828"/></fig></p>
