First, there is a <italic toggle="yes">lack of causal evidence</italic>. Almost all studies were cross-sectional (i.e. the relation between self-reports of psychological factors and people's activism was only measured at one time point). For example, in a nationally representative survey conducted in 2008 [<xref rid="RSOS210006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], participants rated their risk perceptions and collective efficacy about climate change. They then self-reported their past climate actions and their future intentions (e.g. contacting elected officials and attending rallies or meetings). Cross-sectional designs with one time point are appropriate and informative, but only provide weak evidence for causation, which could for example be driven by an unknown third variable.</p>
