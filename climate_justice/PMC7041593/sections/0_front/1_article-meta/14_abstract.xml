<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Abs1"><p id="Par2">On Friday, 20 September 2019, over 4 million people worldwide participated in the youth-led Global Climate Strike. Emphasizing the dire impacts of the climate crisis on people&#8217;s health, planetary health, and health equity, participants called for politicians and those with power to listen to the scientists and to the evidence. But who are these politicians and what is the evidence regarding to whom they listen? In the United States (US), critical research documents how the public&#8217;s will is being subverted&#8212;and people and planetary health are being harmed&#8212;via changes to the &#8216;rules of the game&#8217; that affect democratic governance. Health professionals, organizations, and institutions should encourage civic engagement&#8212;for themselves, their staff, members, and study participants&#8212;regarding: voter registration; being counted in the 2020 Census; countering partisan gerrymandering; and helping to build strong coalitions addressing profound links between climate change, health equity, and democratic governance.</p></abstract>
