<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CS Track has created a database of more than 4,500 CS projects. Although the database essentially comprises information on individual projects, the harvesting of project information used 56 global CS platforms as starting points, which enabled a partially automated approach using web crawling techniques. This database serves as a resource for our explorations, using descriptors and analytic methods to build a coherent understanding of CS based on big data exploration. The database structure is deliberately flexible and can be adjusted to incorporate emerging analysis results. CS Track has also conducted an online survey collecting subjective perceptions of participation and engagement of CS stakeholders with over 1,000 respondents. In some cases, CS Track utilizes interviews and content analysis methods. CS Track also shares its results with the wider CS community through an eMagazine, providing summaries of main findings and other outputs.</p>
