However, there is little evidence of positive climate change interventions by the organizations listed, as well as others, especially in rural areas and among underrepresented populations. Bierbaum <italic>et al.</italic> categorizes four groups of participants in climate change mitigation efforts: &#8220;federal government, states, tribal and local/regional governments, and private sector and non-governmental organizations&#8221; [<xref rid="B99-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] (p. 364). It is recognized that having stakeholders within the private sector who are members of, represent, and/or engage with vulnerable populations take a more active stance and give voice to local citizens and communities serves to guide and benefit the mitigation and adaptation efforts of both public and private entities [<xref rid="B99-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. For example, the Coastal Sustainability Studio at Louisiana State is helping to implement community-developed plans and training tools for areas impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and the Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy have marketing efforts that highlight how various types of stakeholders can positively impact erosion and salt water intrusion. </p>
