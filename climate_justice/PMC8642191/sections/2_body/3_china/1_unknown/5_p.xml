The harmful consequences have fallen disproportionately on working people, as mining accidents and other occupational hazards associated with coal-fired energy production claimed thousands of lives each year (Aden and Sinton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>, 259). Fossil-fuel energy consumption and vehicle exhaust emissions were major sources of the pollution that regularly enveloped Chinese megacities (He <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2015</xref>, 104). Chinese officials have long been aware of these problems. In 2005, Vice-minister Pan Yue of the then-Environmental Protection Agency warned that China&#8217;s economic &#8216;miracle will end soon, because the environment can no longer keep pace&#8217; (Hilton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>, 8). While the predominant global image of China today is of a rising power, Chinese scholars have labelled Chinese residents &#8216;the most directly affected victims&#8217; of the pollution that has accompanied its growth (Hu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2018</xref>, 687). In the years following the Beijing Olympics and the &#8216;blue sky&#8217; days produced for it, concern over air pollution became ubiquitous (Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2018</xref>). Since the 2000s, Chinese officials have accepted the need to target environmental protection as well as growth, at least rhetorically. For example, in 2007 Li Yuanchao, then-party secretary of Jiangsu province and a future PRC vice-president, observed that &#8216;if a child has too many sweets, he will have rotten teeth. GDP is the same. [Sweets are] a good thing but you can&#8217;t go to excess&#8217; (McGregor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>, 90).</p>
