      <td>Box SPM.1.1: This Report assesses the climate response to five illustrative scenarios that cover the range of possible future\ndevelopment of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. They start in 2015, and include scenarios22\nwith high and very high GHG emissions (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and CO emissions that roughly double from current\n2\nlevels by 2100 and 2050, respectively, scenarios with intermediate GHG emissions (SSP2-4.5) and CO emissions remaining\n2\naround current levels until the middle of the century, and scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions and CO emissions\n2\ndeclining to net zero around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO emissions23 (SSP1-1.9 and\n2\nSSP1-2.6), as illustrated in Figure SPM.4. Emissions vary between scenarios depending on socio-economic assumptions,\nlevels of climate change mitigation and, for aerosols and non-methane ozone precursors, air pollution controls. Alternative\nassumptions may result in similar emissions and climate responses, but the socio-economic assumptions and the feasibility\nor likelihood of individual scenarios are not part of the assessment.</td>

      <td>Box SPM.1.2: This Report assesses results from climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project\nPhase 6 (CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. These models include new and better representations of\nphysical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, compared to climate models considered in previous\nIPCC assessment reports. This has improved the simulation of the recent mean state of most large-scale indicators of climate\nchange and many other aspects across the climate system. Some differences from observations remain, for example in\nregional precipitation patterns. The CMIP6 historical simulations assessed in this Report have an ensemble mean global\nsurface temperature change within 0.2&#176;C of the observations over most of the historical period, and observed warming is\nwithin the very likely range of the CMIP6 ensemble. However, some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is either above\nor below the assessed very likely range of observed warming.</td>

      <td>Box SPM.1.3: The CMIP6 models considered in this Report have a wider range of climate sensitivity than in CMIP5 models\nand the AR6 assessed very likely range, which is based on multiple lines of evidence. These CMIP6 models also show\na higher average climate sensitivity than CMIP5 and the AR6 assessed best estimate. The higher CMIP6 climate sensitivity\nvalues compared to CMIP5 can be traced to an amplifying cloud feedback that is larger in CMIP6 by about 20%.</td>

      <td>Box SPM.1.4: For the first time in an IPCC report, assessed future changes in global surface temperature, ocean warming\nand sea level are constructed by combining multi-model projections with observational constraints based on past simulated\nwarming, as well as the AR6 assessment of climate sensitivity. For other quantities, such robust methods do not yet exist\nto constrain the projections. Nevertheless, robust projected geographical patterns of many variables can be identified at\na given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of timing when the global warming\nlevel is reached.</td>
