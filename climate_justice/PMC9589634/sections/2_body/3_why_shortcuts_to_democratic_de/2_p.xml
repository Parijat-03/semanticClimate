The expertocratic modeling of the interface between science and politics can be described as <italic>linear</italic>: According to this model, scientific findings determine the right political measures, which are legitimized precisely by the fact that they are supposedly objectively right (van der Sluijs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>, p. 410). But this postulation of objectivity underestimates the factor of uncertainty in science: Even if the fact of anthropogenic climate change can be described as a scientific consensus, there is no unanimity within the research community either about the concrete extent of the expected consequences or about the measures to be taken, i.e., the action that follows from the knowledge. Consequently, there is no objective best practice that some council of scientists could decide on with unanimity beyond all doubt (cf. Saretzki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>, p. 61). At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was also a high degree of uncertainty. While the learning curve has been exceptionally steep, even enabling the development and approval of a vaccine within less than a year, considerable and reasonable disagreement remains within the scientific community. Disagreements concern, for example, the long-term health effects of infections in different age groups and the benefits of vaccinating younger children. Moreover, social and economic consequences of containment measures remain to be explored.</p>
