<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0010">In <italic>Rising</italic>, Elizabeth Rush uses her experience as a female journalist and scholar to eloquently tell the stories of those impacted by a changing climate in America, and situate those experiences within the broader story of climate change. Specifically, Rush documents the story of changing coastlines, and what that means for the vulnerable residents who live within these rapidly evolving environments. Hearing the voices of vulnerable citizens already impacted by rising seas and environmental degradation brings clarity and power to voices often ignored by those in positions of power, and humanizes the threat that anthropogenic climate change poses. This work bridges the gap between the research and reporting on the changing climate and rising seas, with the citizens already impacted by the scientific research, and if we are living through the sixth great extinction event in the history of Earth, then &#8220;never before have humans been there to tell the tale&#8221; (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Rush, 2019</xref>, p. 7). Rush explains,<disp-quote><p>(U)nlike Descartes, I believe that language can lessen the distance between humans and the world of which we are a part; I believe that it can foster interspecies intimacy and, as a result, care. If, as Robin Wall Kimmerer suggests in her essay on the power of identifying all living beings with personal pronouns, &#8220;naming is the beginning of justice.&#8221; (pp. 5&#8211;6)</p></disp-quote>
