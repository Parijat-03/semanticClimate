It was informed by previous discussions of Extension in Virginia Tech&#8217;s Climate Action Commitment, where I participated on the Land and Agriculture subcommittee, and by my own research into Extension programs and development politics in Guatemala. The leadership team at VCE showed an openness and enthusiasm for dialogue and patience with my questions and incomplete understanding of their work. My call for explicit alignment with liberationist impulses in Extension echoes calls for politically engaged scholarship with movements for economic, racial, gender, and ecological justice (Hale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). Insightful comments from three reviewers led me to examine the deeper history of inequality in Extension programs. This essay should in no way be construed as reflecting the opinions of Virginia Cooperative Extension, Virginia Tech, or COIA.</p>
