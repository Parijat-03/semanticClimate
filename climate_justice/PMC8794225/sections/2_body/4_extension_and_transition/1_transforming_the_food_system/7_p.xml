These coalitions could lobby against agribusiness subsidies and support environmental and labor protections, countering the Farm Bureau&#8217;s influence, while making the case for alternative land use and ownership regimes in solidarity with Black and Indigenous struggles for land and self-determination. In these and more ways, Liberation Extension could work to reorganize common sense around agriculture, and help &#8220;stich together a coalition that can challenge the dominant mode of agriculture and create a more just food system&#8221; (Patel and Goodman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>). This is vital to addressing climate change, would significantly reduce rural poverty in the US and benefit subsistence agriculture in the Global South, and anticipates the economic and food system disruptions from global warming which will require a shift to small farming &#8220;as multitudes of people look for localized low carbon work&#8221; (Smaje <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2020</xref>, p. 34).</p>
