These characteristics intensified the susceptibility of the inhabitants and of rice production to socio-economic change (such as increased schooling and migration), which in turn increased their vulnerability to climate change. Additionally, not only has the government failed to defend the inhabitants' human rights, but both the state and conservationists have also failed to recognize and compensate them for their management practices, which contribute to GHG emission reduction and carbon sequestration, and/or to provide funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation measures (e.g., through the National Programme of Action of Adaptation to Climate Changes).</p>
