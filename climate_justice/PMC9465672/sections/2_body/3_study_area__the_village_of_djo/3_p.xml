When the population density in Arame started to grow, one hunter discovered the land of Djobel and began to create mangrove swamp rice fields there. Eventually, others moved in and established a large village. As a result, the permanently dry land no longer provided enough room for their houses to plant rice and allow their livestock to roam.</p>
