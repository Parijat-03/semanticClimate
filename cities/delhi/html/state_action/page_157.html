It aimed at improving the better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security and in combination with a low carbon power generation mix, reduced greenhouse gas emissions. With vehicular pollution being a consistent source of air pollution in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (&#8216;Delhi&#8217;) and contributing up to 30% of particulate pollution, rapid adoption of zero emission electric vehicles is of great importance to the city. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.33" top="633.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="633.27" x1="526.33" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 633.27; y1: 645.27; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">India is a member of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI), a multi-governmental policy forum dedicated to accelerating the deployment of EVs. The EV@30 campaign, launched in 2017, sets a collective aspirational goal for all EVI members to have EVs contribute to 30% of all vehicle sales by 2030. This policy will apply exclusively to Battery Electric Vehicles (as defined in &#8216;FAME India&#8217;, which was launched in March 2015). Mild Hybrid, Strong Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles will not be targeted by this policy. &#8216;FAME India&#8217; in this policy refers to the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &amp;) Electric Vehicles in India as notified in March, 2015 by the Govt. of India. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.01" top="494.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="494.28" x1="526.01" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 494.28; y1: 506.28; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The primary objective of the Delhi EV Policy 2018 is to bring about a material improvement in Delhi&#8217;s air quality by bringing down emissions from transport sector. To do so, this policy will seek to drive rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in a manner where they contribute to 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2023. This policy will also seek to put in place measures to support the creation of jobs in driving, selling, financing, servicing and charging of EVs. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.42" top="387.1"><span x0="72.02" y0="387.1" x1="526.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 387.1; y1: 399.1; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is well on its way to become the largest user of CNG vehicles in the world. Euro VI norms are being implemented by the vehicles running within the City. Low sulphur diesel (up to 5 ppm) has been made available in the City. Other actions taken to reduce the overall vehicle pollution loads include phasing out of 15 year old commercial vehicles, adopting new vehicle technology and matching emission standards,) improving the performance of existing vehicles through better inspection and maintenance, promotion of emission less battery operated vehicles by the government by providing concessions up to 29.5% (15% base price, 2% road tax and registration expense and 12.5 % VAT refund). Other initiatives taken by government include- widening of Ring Road from 6 lanes to 8 lanes; conversion of road from Delhi to Gurgoan to eight lane express way, bypass road from Kalindi Colony to Badarpur;  and construction of signal free flyovers and under passes for traffic decongestion. Government has also banned the manufacturing of BSLV III engines, and implemented policy to ensure that only eco-friendly BSLV VI engine is manufactured. There has also been tightening of mass emission standards for new vehicles. The quality of the fuel being supplied in Delhi has been significantly improved over the years by the ban of selling leaded petrol, introduction of low sulphur diesel, reduction of sulphur and benzene content in petrol.</span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.1" top="121.15"><span x0="72.02" y0="121.15" x1="526.1" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 121.15; y1: 133.15; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi Government as per the recommendation of High Power Committee under Chief Secretary, Delhi and in consultation with all concerned departments has prepared an air pollution control Action plan with immediate, short term and long term actions to be taken by various departments. Further to this, National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed various orders </span></div></body></html>
