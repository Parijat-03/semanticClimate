Within this decade we must bend the global curves of greenhouse gases emissions <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> of biodiversity loss. And let us not fool ourselves. Biosphere stewardship for Earth resilience puts stringent boundaries on &#8220;net-zero&#8221; targets for climate that have already been adopted by more than 100 countries to date. The &#8220;net&#8221; in net-zero targets for climate, therefore, must not result in delayed action to rapidly drive down fossil fuel emissions. Carbon markets, increasingly relied on to efficiently finance climate solutions, must follow strict science-based standards, such that net-zero targets are genuinely achieved.</p>
