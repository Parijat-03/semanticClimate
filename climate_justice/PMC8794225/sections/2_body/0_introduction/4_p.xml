In the next section, I assess some of the ways Extension programs have responded to these problems and limits to these responses. In section three, I describe some core elements of Liberation Extension and steps for institutionalization. In section four, I explore how Liberation Extension could support transition processes in agriculture, mutual aid, and climate change mitigation.</p>
