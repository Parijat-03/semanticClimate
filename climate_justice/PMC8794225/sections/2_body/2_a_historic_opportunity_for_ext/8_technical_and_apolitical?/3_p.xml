Today, however, there is a prevailing sense that Extension must tread lightly, as it does not make policy and is limited by state and federal funding, and so as to not offend conservative partners (Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). Some conservative state administrations have deliberately restricted conversations around Extension (Scott Peters, personal communication). However, many opportunities exist for a more proactive and progressive Extension practice. And much can be accomplished by making small but meaningful changes, consciously and deliberately, within existing programs.</p>
