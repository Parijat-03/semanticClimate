For Trexler and Schendler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], corporate SBTs represent a &#8220;costly distraction&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for aggressive global emission reductions by cloaking &#8220;ineffective actions as meaningful solutions.&#8221; The principal reasoning is that SBTs imply that corporate action can substitute for public climate policy since companies pledge to decarbonize even in the absence of carbon pricing and other regulation. In stark contrast, Marland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] see corporate action as a catalyst for change and argue for positive policy feedback effects arising from corporate initiatives such as setting SBTs. Premised on the continued failure of transnational and &#8220;top-down&#8221; climate governance and the need for a polycentric or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; approach, they see corporate efforts as an enabler and driver of more ambitious climate policy. Although stressing the importance of prescriptive policy, Lister [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] similarly states that corporate SBT-setting ideally &#8220;helps to fortify, translate and strengthen the international emission reduction goals.&#8221;</p>
