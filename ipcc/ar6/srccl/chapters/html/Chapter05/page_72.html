While the term landscape is by no means precise (Englund et al. 2017), landscape approaches, focused, for example, at catchment scale, are generally agreed to be the best way to tackle competing demands for land (e.g.,&#160;Sayer&#160;et al. 2013), and are the appropriate scale at which to focus the implementation of sustainable intensification. The landscape approach allots land to various uses&#160;&#8211; cropping, intensive and extensive grazing, forestry, mining, conservation, recreation, urban, industry, infrastructure&#160;&#8211; through a&#160;planning process that seeks to balance conservation and production objectives. With respect to SI, a&#160;landscape approach is pertinent to achieving potential benefits for biodiversity conservation, ensuring that land &#8216;spared&#8217; through SI remains protected, and that adverse impacts of agriculture on conservation land are minimised. Depending on the land&#160;governance mechanisms applied in the jurisdiction, different approaches will be appropriate/required. However, benefits are&#160;only assured if land-use restrictions are devised and enforced.</span></div><div left="332.22" right="369.18" top="423.14"><span style="x0: 332.22; x1: 336.97; y0: 423.14; y1: 432.64; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="332.22" y0="423.14" x1="369.18">Summary</span><span style="x0: 332.22; x1: 334.52; y0: 411.14; y1: 420.64; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="332.22" y0="411.14" x1="551.91">Intensification needs to be achieved sustainably, necessitating a&#160;balance between productivity today and future potential (</span><span style="x0: 334.86; x1: 339.44; y0: 387.14; y1: 396.64; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="334.86" y0="387.14" x1="457.71">high&#160;agreement, medium evidence</span><span style="x0: 457.71; x1: 460.36; y0: 387.14; y1: 396.64; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="457.71" y0="387.14" x1="551.93">).

Both the demand side and supply side roles are important relative to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Urban areas are home to more than half of the world&#8217;s population, and a&#160;minimal proportion of the production. Thus, they are important drivers for the development of the complex food systems in place today, especially with regard to supply chains and dietary preferences. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.06" top="111.12"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 111.12; y1: 120.62; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="111.12" x1="566.06">The increasing separation of urban and rural populations with regard to territory and culture is one of the factors favouring the nutrition transition towards urban diets (Weber and Matthews 2008; Neira et al. 2016).
