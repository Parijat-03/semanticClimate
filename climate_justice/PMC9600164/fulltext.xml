<bold>Alice McGushin and colleagues</bold> argue for recognition of the diverse ways in which climate change affects adolescent wellbeing and call for health professionals to work with them to respond to the crisis</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The world is already 1.1&#x000b0;C warmer than during pre-industrial levels, and we can expect further rises of between 1.5&#x000b0;C and 3.5&#x000b0;C by the end of this century, depending on the scale and speed of climate change mitigation.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The impact of global warming is far greater for a child born today than for older generations: in comparison with someone born in 1960, a person born in 2020 will experience considerably more exposure to drought, crop failures, river floods, and four times as many heat waves throughout their lifetime.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Adding to this, it is projected that low income countries will have the greatest increase in the number of young people aged 10-24 in the coming decades. The younger generations in these countries will experience the greatest rise in climate related exposures, with vulnerabilities compounded by continuing protracted inequity driven by colonialism, poverty, challenges of governance and conflict, and marginalisation due to gender, ethnicity, and low income.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p><p>The climate crisis is the biggest global health threat of our century,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> destabilising social, environmental, and economic determinants of health and wellbeing. Despite compelling evidence that climate change will affect the life of every child born today, an understanding of the effects on adolescents is limited. We argue that it is time for more explicit recognition by health professionals of these impacts on adolescents&#x02019; physical and mental health, and also the broader effects on their wellbeing. It is important that health professionals recognise their responsibility to support adolescents and protect their wellbeing from the climate crisis.</p><p>To analyse the effects of climate change on adolescents, we use an existing definition and conceptual framework of adolescent wellbeing.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Adolescent wellbeing is a state in which adolescents have the support, confidence, and resources to thrive, realising their full potential and rights.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Good health and optimum nutrition are recognised as essential for adolescent wellbeing, acting as both determinants and outcomes of four other domains: connectedness, positive values, and contributions to society; safety and supportive environments; learning, education, and employability; and agency and resilience.</p><p>Climate change threatens all aspects of adolescent wellbeing (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>), but not all adolescents are passive victims of this crisis. We highlight examples of the ways in which adolescents around the world have taken leadership, demonstrating agency and resilience both individually and collectively. They are a heterogeneous group, however, and their capacity to cope in a changing climate can be fostered by an environment, strengthened by functioning support systems at individual, community, country, and global levels.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Health professionals have a clear role in supporting adolescents to thrive in a changing climate.</p><fig position="float" id="f1" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Adolescent wellbeing framework, described by the H6+ Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing* and adapted to include related climate change effects and interventions at the level of health professionals and the broader community. *The H6+ Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing includes the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health; United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; Unesco; UN Population Fund; Unicef, UN Major Group for Children and Youth; UN Women; World Bank; World Food Programme; and World Health Organization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mcga071690.f1" position="float"/></fig><sec sec-type="other1"><title>Climate crisis affects all domains of adolescent wellbeing</title><p>To understand the effects of the climate crisis on adolescents&#x02019; health and nutrition, we examine the evidence of its risks to leading health concerns for adolescents. Climate change exacerbates the risk of injury, the leading cause of death and disability in this age group, by exposure to extreme weather events, with adolescents with disabilities and chronic diseases at greatest risk in disasters.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Considering asthma, the most common chronic disease among adolescents, higher pollen levels, longer pollen seasons, worsening air quality, and increasing thunderstorms all increase the risk of acute asthma attacks.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>The psychological distress caused by extreme weather, climate induced forced migration, and expectation of future hazards might have lifelong consequences for the mental wellbeing of adolescents&#x02014;with the effects more likely to be experienced by those in low and middle income countries.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The climate crisis also affects adolescents&#x02019; nutrition, with downstream effects on physical and cognitive development; adolescent girls in low and middle income countries are more likely than boys, or adolescents in high income countries, to go hungry after climate related disasters.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>The climate crisis affects adolescents&#x02019; relationship with families and communities causing temporary and permanent migration and displacement, within countries and across borders. Although age disaggregated data are scarce, a high proportion of those displaced owing to climate related disasters is under 18.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Before recent conflict, adolescents in the drought affected Tigray region of Ethiopia were forced to separate from their families because of food insecurity, loss of livelihoods, and the need to earn an income.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>A disrupted and unsafe living environment is another effect of the climate crisis. Climate related economic shocks and low rainfall have increased the risk of armed conflict in some settings.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The resulting effects of such conflict on adolescents can last a lifetime and be passed down generations.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Drought and heat waves have also been found to increase the risk of intimate partner violence.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, extreme events such as the 2010&#x02013;11 Horn of Africa drought increase the likelihood of child marriage, with young girls sold in exchange for livestock and other necessities, as their families struggled with scarce resources.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>Attainment of quality education, the fourth Sustainable Development Goal, is threatened by the climate crisis. In 2017, 18&#x02009;000 schools in South Asia were closed owing to river flooding.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Schools in Bangladesh remained closed a year after the destruction of the Cyclone Aila, and extreme weather events are the commonest cause of unplanned school closures in the US.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Moreover, when communities face water scarcity and drought, adolescents, particularly girls, might be removed from school to support their families. Higher temperatures are also known to affect the academic performance of both students and teachers.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>Finally, agency and resilience are threatened both by the climate crisis and the gap between actions needed and those that adolescents see being taken by global leaders. The dissonance between government responses and the prospect for the world has left many adolescents feeling a loss of agency, apathy, and disillusionment.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Psychological distress caused by climate change is becoming particularly prevalent among adolescents. In a recent survey of over 10&#x02009;000 young people aged 16-25 in 10 countries, over 50% of respondents reported feeling anxious, afraid, and powerless in the face of climate crisis.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p><p>With these overwhelming threats to wellbeing, one would not blame adolescents for feeling hopeless and helpless. Nevertheless, there are many and varied examples of adolescents responding to the climate crisis with agency and resilience. We argue that many are exhibiting leadership beyond their years, sometimes beyond that which is displayed by those in positions of power.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other2"><title>Adolescents showing agency and resilience </title><p>It has often been suggested that action is an antidote to climate related anxiety and poor wellbeing.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Young people who take part in climate action have fostered individual and interpersonal skills that contribute to youth development, such as the capacity to self-regulate emotions and behaviour, take part in teamwork, act on values such as social and environmental justice, and reduce the feeling of being alone and powerless.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Adolescents on every continent are taking part in climate action. To combat malnutrition in their communities, adolescents from youth led organisations in Rwanda are being trained in nutrition advocacy and associated concerns, such as environmental protection, gender discrimination, education, and the economy.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Adolescents surveyed in flood prone areas in Indonesia, Burkina Faso, and Bolivia and in areas of drought in South Africa expressed a strong sense of duty and empathy, which they used to support their communities&#x02014;for example, by sharing information on ways to conserve water.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Building personal resilience to climate related threats, Inuit youth in Canada described factors such as being on the land and connecting with Inuit culture as protective for their mental health and wellbeing.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>Adolescents have used the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child, including the right to life and health, in lawsuits against governments. In a legal petition filed by 16 adolescents against five G20 members (Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey), claiming violation of their rights, Deborah Adegbile of Nigeria asserted that she had been repeatedly admitted to hospital for asthma attacks, triggered by rising temperatures and smog.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Upholding their right to education, students at Santa Paz National High School in the Philippines won a campaign to have their school relocated because of the risk of a landslide.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Adolescents are also taking what they have learnt about climate change to educate their families and communities, driving broader societal action.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>The &#x0201c;Fridays for Future&#x0201d; movement has resulted in the largest climate protests in history, with actions in over 7500 cities around the world. As the &#x0201c;new ambassadors for scientific consensus and climate mitigation,&#x0201d; adolescents are at the forefront of the movement to hold governments and industries accountable for their emissions.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Many young people, however, assert that their inclusion in global platforms, such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conferences, has been tokenistic rather than a serious attempt to respond to their views.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</p><p>Adolescents rarely hold the power to implement the change and transformation necessary to protect all people from the negative effects of the climate crisis. As illustrated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, there is a need for &#x0201c;equitable sharing of benefits and burdens of mitigation&#x0201d; and an enhancement of the resilience of those who are most vulnerable, through a climate justice lens.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While it is adolescents&#x02019; right to have their views taken seriously in all matters that affect them, the responsibility falls squarely on those who hold power&#x02014;governments, policy makers, and the health community&#x02014;to lead in responding to the climate crisis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other3"><title>How health professionals can unite with young people </title><p>Many adults are failing young people, but we argue that health professionals have a social responsibility to join with adolescents in responding to the climate crisis. Other health leaders have argued that because of their many professional and societal roles, health professionals are in a unique and privileged position to influence change.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Such change has been seen for other health concerns, including sanitation and hygiene, tobacco control legislation, denuclearisation, and the prevention of war. Health professionals must do the same for the climate crisis, to support the wellbeing of adolescents and their communities.</p><p>Health professionals will be on the frontline of providing climate and age sensitive health services to adolescents. Evidence is scarce, however, on both the effects of climate change on adolescents and effective interventions to be taken by health professionals to protect any age group.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> To implement the most appropriate climate interventions, it is crucial that health professionals support the surveillance, analysis, and reporting of the climate sensitive burden of disease on adolescents, while being aware of other factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, history of exploitation, and geographical location. Furthermore, more evidence is needed for those interventions which might protect adolescent wellbeing in climate related conflict and disaster settings, and for adolescents experiencing climate related migration.</p><p>The experience and competence of health professionals at every level is essential to protecting the wellbeing of all people from the effects of climate change. The younger generation of health professionals is providing leadership, with medical students acting globally to include climate change within curriculums.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Like adolescents, health professionals can spread awareness of the scale and effect of climate change, and its links to adolescent wellbeing, involving educators, parents, peers, and elected officials, so that they can make informed decisions about individual and collective responses to the climate crisis.</p><p>The health community can also work to decarbonise its own practice. Now almost 60 countries have committed to having low carbon resilient healthcare systems, and there will be global cooperation to support net zero healthcare efforts.<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The evidence and the action in this area are expanding rapidly, with opportunities to decarbonise also at the individual practice, health facility, and specialty level.</p><p>Health professionals should collaborate with adolescents in their advocacy efforts. Using their skills developed in training and practice and their societal influence, health professionals can take part in intergenerational dialogue and involve adolescents in climate and health related policy making processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As part of a holistic approach to adolescent wellbeing, it is clear that the climate crisis has far reaching effects on adolescents. Despite&#x02014;or because of&#x02014;this overwhelming threat to their current and future wellbeing, many adolescents show the ability to respond; we are encouraged that health workers have recently stepped up to this challenge, although further work is necessary, across all the areas we have described above. It is imperative that health professionals work hand in hand with adolescents to enable them to thrive in the 21st century.</p><boxed-text id="boxa" position="float"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p>The worsening threat of climate change affects all aspects of adolescents&#x02019; wellbeing</p></list-item><list-item><p>Many feel the threat to their future, are overwhelmed by the scale of the problem, and are disillusioned by inadequate action of those in power</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adolescents are taking matters into their own hands, acting individually and collectively to reduce the negative effects of the climate crisis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Health professionals must work collectively with adolescents to mitigate the effects of climate change on adolescent wellbeing</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The writing group members are Shanthi Ameratunga (University of Auckland), Valentina Baltag (World Health Organization), Michelle Heys (University College London), Ra&#x000fa;l Mercer (Programme of Social Sciences and Health, Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales), Adesola O Olumide (University of Ibadan), and Mark Tomlinson (Stellenbosch University).
