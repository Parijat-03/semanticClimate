One shall consider the vast progress that occurred in finance in the last decades. Financial markets have been more integrated and most of countries enhanced their domestic financial development (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Sen and Laha, 2019</xref>). Novel FinTech tools and financial instruments are popping up. These instruments can dramatically contribute to increasing financial access rates &#8211; especially amongst vulnerable groups (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cicchiello et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Demirg&#252;&#231;-Kunt and Klapper, 2013</xref>).
