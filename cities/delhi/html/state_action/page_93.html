Delhi Solar Roof Top Policy has been approved by cabinet. This has many innovative features like Group net Metering, Virtual net metering, Generation based Incentive, waiver of inspection by electrical inspector upto 200 kw capacity Solar power plant. Net metering regulations have already been notified in Delhi. And Delhi has 81.13 MW of installed capacity of solar power until February 2018. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.23" top="645.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="645.27" x1="508.23" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 645.27; y1: 657.27; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Govt. is also promoting generation of non-solar power and setting up Waste to Energy Plants at various locations by using the municipal solid waste. Waste-to-Energy plants at Timarpur-Okhla &amp; Ghazipur are functioning and a third at Narela-Bawana inaugurated in March 2017. The three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board send 8,370 tons of garbage to the three landfills at Bhalswa, Okhla and Ghazipur and 52 MW of electricity is generated from these waste-to-energy plants.</span><span x0="491.14" y0="571.33" x1="499.24" style="x0: 491.14; x1: 495.16; y0: 571.33; y1: 579.37; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">20</span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.38" top="534.24"><span x0="72.02" y0="534.24" x1="508.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 534.24; y1: 546.24; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The TPDDL, BRPL and BYPL are setting up of various Grid Connected Solar Power Plants intheir respective license area. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in order to carry out projects for the production of renewable solar power in the Delhi Metro premises.  As per the MoU, both the organizations will collaborate for the development of Solar PV (Photovoltaic) Projects (ground mounted, rooftop and other possible modes) at identified DMRC Sites for the production of solar energy. After signing of this MoU, a pilot project, of 500 kWp rooftop grid connected Solar PV Project has been installed at one of the identified rooftops of the Delhi Metro Stations. The two organizations will also explore the possibility of developing of another site where Solar PV Plant can be set-up. As on August 2017, DMRC has already commissioned 20 MWp solar plants in its premises. SPV plants are also being installed at various government buildings, schools and hospitals and the total capacity of renewable energy in Delhi until February 2018 was 133.13 MW. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="393.67" top="315.7"><span x0="72.02" y0="315.7" x1="393.67" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 315.7; y1: 327.7; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) programme </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.21" top="284.14"><span x0="72.02" y0="284.14" x1="508.21" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 284.14; y1: 296.14; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Domestic sector accounts for almost 50% of energy consumption in Delhi and lighting is a key component of the same. In order to promote the use of LEDs in household sector and reduce the energy consumption, EE&amp;REM Centre in association with Energy Efficiency Services limited (EESL), BSES Rajdhani, BSES Yamuna and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) has implemented the UJALA in Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.1" top="188.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="188.95" x1="508.1" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 188.95; y1: 200.95; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">UJALA promotes the usage of LEDs at a minimal cost and is designed to monetize the energy consumption reduction for the domestic consumers. The distribution of LEDs through this programme will reduce energy consumption by 88% (as compared to ordinary bulb) and 50% (as compared to CFLs). Also, 75.51 lakh numbers of LED Bulbs distributed in Delhi as on 27.12.2016. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="78.5" top="77.08"><span x0="72.02" y0="77.08" x1="78.5" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 75.26; y0: 77.08; y1: 83.56; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">20</span><span x0="81.02" y0="72.85" x1="150.71" style="x0: 81.02; x1: 87.67; y0: 72.85; y1: 82.81; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">Budget 2018-19. </span></div></body></html>
