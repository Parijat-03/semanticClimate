Sustainable development requires the pursuit of synergies and the avoidance of trade-offs between the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. It can thus provide pathways  that  accelerate  progress  towards  ambitious  climate  change  mitigation  goals.  Factoring  in equality and distributional effects will be particularly important in the pursuit of sustainable policies and partnerships, and in accelerating the transition to sustainable development. Using climate change as a key conduit can only work if synergies across sectors are exploited and if policy implementation is supported by national and international partnerships. </span></div><div style="" id="id13528"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13529">The speed, quality, depth and scale of the transition will depend on the developmental starting point, that  is,  on  explicit  goals  as  well  as  the  enabling  environment  consisting  of  individual  behaviour, mindsets,  beliefs  and  actions,  social  cohesion,  governance,  policies,  institutions,  social  and technological innovations etc. The integration of both climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in  sustainable  development  is  also  essential  in  the  establishment  of  fair  and  robust  transformation pathways</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id13535">.  </span></div><div style="" id="id13537"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13538">FAQ 17.2 What role do considerations of justice and inclusivity play in the transition towards sustainable development?</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13540"> Negative economic and social impacts in some regions could emerge as a consequence of ambitious climate change mitigation policies if these are not aligned with key sustainable development aspirations such as those represented by the SDGs </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13544">on &#8216;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13545">no poverty, energy-, water- and food access</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13546">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13547"> etc., which could in turn slow down the transition process. Nonetheless, many climate change mitigation policies could generate incomes, new jobs and other benefits. Capturing these benefits could require specific policies  and  investments  to  be  targeted  directly  towards  including  all  parts  of  society  in  the  new activities and industries created by the climate change mitigation policies, and that activities that are reduced in the context of transitions to a low carbon future, including industries and geographical areas, are seeing new opportunities. Poor understanding of how governance at multiple levels can meet these challenges to the transition may fail to make significant progress in relation to national policies and a global  climate  agreement.  It  may  therefore  either  support  or  weaken  the  climate  architecture,  thus constituting a limiting factor. </span></div><div style="" id="id13558"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13559">FAQ 17.3 How critical are the roles of institutions in accelerating the transition and what can governance enable? </span></div><div style="" id="id13562"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13563">Institutions are critical in accelerating the transition towards sustainable development: they can help to shape climate change response strategies in terms of both adaptation and mitigation. Local institutions are  the  custodians  of  critical  adaptation  services,  ranging  from  the  mobilisation  of  resources,  skills development  and  capacity-building  to  the  dissemination  of  critical  strategies.  Transitions  towards sustainable  development  are  mediated  by  actors  within  particular  institutions,  the  governance mechanisms  they  use  as  implementing  tools  and  the  political  coalitions  they  form  to  enable  action. Patterns of production and consumption have implications for a low-carbon development, and many of these  patterns  can  act  as  barriers  or  opportunities  towards  sustainable  development.  Trade  policies, international economic issues and international financial flows can  positively support the speed and scale of the transition; alternatively, they can have negative impacts on policies that may inhibit the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13574">process. Nonetheless, contextual factors are a fundamental part of the change process, and institutions and their governance systems provide pathways that can influence contextual realities on the ground. For  instance,  politically  vested  interests  may  lead  powerful  lobby  groups  or  coalition  networks  to influence the direction of the transition, or they could put pressure on a given political elite through the </span></div><div style="" id="id13589"/>
