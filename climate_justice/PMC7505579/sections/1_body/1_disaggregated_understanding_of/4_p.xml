Such approaches can help capture the real-life context and better explore, and map <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, societal innovations in terms of lifestyle changes. These need not be limited to supply-side technologies <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, as is mostly the case in the literature, but extend their scope to behavioural shifts, such as dietary selections <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, energy and other consumption profiles, investment decisions, means of transportation and modal shifts <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, and broader lifestyle changes, exploiting the capabilities of the diverse multiplicity <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, or combinations, of these frameworks <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>.</p>
