<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><bold>(2) Climate-related challenges of the day:</bold> On each day of the PCS, classes can optionally participate in the challenge of the day, a format that encourages students to further explore specific topics and enables them to take action by initiating their own projects and activities. Activities include, inter alia, recording impacts of humans on the environment in poems, podcasts or videos, preparation of material for climate protests, writing letters to politicians at local, state or federal levels demanding comprehensive mitigation and adaptation measures or identifying further possibilities to take action on the climate crisis. The challenges aim at strengthening students&#8217; self-efficacy and agency. They are announced directly before the live sessions on the YouTube channel and are published on the PCS website. Participating teachers and students decide autonomously whether and how to participate in the challenges. Reporting of activities to the implementation team is at the discretion of teachers.</p>
