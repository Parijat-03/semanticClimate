<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par57">The EU bioeconomy policy primarily aims to advance economic sustainability, green growth, and EU global competitiveness, by substituting non-renewables for renewables, modernizing production and consumption, boosting technology, research and innovation, and promoting circular and cascade use of materials and products. Socioecological emergencies and existential crises, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and ecosystem degradation, are framed as challenges to achieving these goals. Based on the decolonial environmental justice and degrowth perspectives, the agenda proposed in the bioeconomy policy and the revised strategy is insufficient in several ways. The EU&#8217;s ecological and climate debt are left unaddressed. Global inequalities and responsibilities for the EU&#8217;s historical colonial and current neo-colonial extraction and appropriation of resources from the Global South are sidelined. Sufficiency or decreases of EU production and consumption levels, which fuel domestic and global socioecological burden and injustices, are not among suggested policy measures. Economic sustainability, creation of &#8216;green jobs&#8217;, circular economy approaches and the focus on participation of stakeholders and equal economic opportunity within Europe are insufficient to tackle the socioecological crises at hand. The same holds for substitution of non-renewables with renewables, coupled with technology, research and innovation, and EU global competitiveness.</p>
