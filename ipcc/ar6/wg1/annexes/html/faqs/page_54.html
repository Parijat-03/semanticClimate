Sea level will continue to rise by an additional 10&#8211;25 cm by 2050. The major reasons for this ongoing rise in sea level are the thermal expansion of seawater as its temperature increases, and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. Local sea level changes can be larger or smaller than the global average, with the smallest changes in formerly glaciated areas, and the largest changes in low-lying river delta regions.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.87" top="600.22"><span x0="69.02" y0="600.22" x1="539.87" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 600.22; y1: 609.22; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Across the globe, sea level is rising, and the rate of increase has accelerated. Sea level increased by about 4&#160;mm per year from 2006 to 2018, which was more than double the average rate over the 20th&#160;century. Rise during the early 1900s was due to natural factors, such as glaciers catching up to warming that occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during the 1800s. However, since at least 1970, human activities have been the dominant cause of global average sea level rise, and they will continue to be for centuries into the future.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.83" top="534.23"><span x0="69.02" y0="534.23" x1="539.83" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 534.23; y1: 543.23; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Sea level rises either through warming of ocean waters or the addition of water from melting ice and bodies of water on land. Expansion due to warming caused about 50% of the rise observed from 1971 to 2018. Melting glaciers contributed about 22% over the same period. Melting of the two large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica has contributed about 13% and 7%, respectively, during 1971 to 2018, but melting has accelerated in the recent decades, increasing their contribution to 22% and 14% since 2016. Another source is changes in land-water storage: reservoirs and aquifers on land have reduced, which contributed about an 8% increase in&#160;sea&#160;level.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="444.25"><span x0="69.02" y0="444.25" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 444.25; y1: 453.25; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">By 2050, sea level is expected to rise an additional 10&#8211;25 cm whether or not greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (FAQ 9.2, Figure&#160;1). Beyond 2050, the amount by which sea level will rise is more uncertain. The accumulated total emissions of greenhouse gases over the upcoming decades will play a&#160;big role beyond 2050, especially in determining where sea level rise and ice-sheet changes eventually level off.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="390.26"><span x0="69.02" y0="390.26" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 390.26; y1: 399.26; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Even if net zero emissions are reached, sea level rise will continue because the deep ocean will continue to warm and ice sheets will take time to catch up to the warming caused by past and present emissions: ocean and ice sheets are slow to respond to environmental changes (see FAQ 5.3). Some projections under low emissions show sea level rise continuing as net zero is approached at a&#160;rate comparable to today (3&#8211;8&#160;mm per year by 2100 versus 3&#8211;4&#160;mm per year in 2015), while others show substantial acceleration to more than five times the present rate by 2100, especially if emissions continue to be high and processes that accelerate retreat of the Antarctic Ice Sheet occur widely (FAQ 9.1).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.81" top="300.28"><span x0="69.02" y0="300.28" x1="539.81" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 300.28; y1: 309.28; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Sea level rise will increase the frequency and severity of extreme sea level events at coasts (see FAQ 8.2), such as storm surges, wave inundation and tidal floods: risk can be increased by even small changes in global average sea level. Scientists project that, in some regions, extreme sea level events that were recently expected once in 100&#160;years will occur annually at 20&#8211;25% of locations by 2050 regardless of emissions, but by 2100 emissions choice will matter: annually at 60% of locations for low emissions, and at 80% of locations under strong emissions.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.79" top="234.29"><span x0="69.02" y0="234.29" x1="539.79" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 71.53; y0: 234.29; y1: 243.29; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">In many places, local sea level change will be larger or smaller than the global average. From year to year and place to place, changes in ocean circulation and wind can lead to local sea level change. In regions where large ice sheets, such as the Fennoscandian in Eurasia and the Laurentide and Cordilleran in North America, covered the land during the last ice age, the land is still slowly rising up now that the extra weight of the ice sheets is gone. This local recovery is compensating for global sea level rise in these regions and can even lead to local decrease in sea level. In regions just beyond where the former ice sheets reached and the Earth bulged upwards, the land is now falling and, as a&#160;result, local sea level rise is faster than the global rate. In many regions within low-lying delta regions (such as New Orleans and the Ganges&#8211;Brahmaputra delta), the land is rapidly subsiding (sinking) because of human activities such as building dams or groundwater and fossil fuel extraction. Further, when an ice sheet melts, it has less gravitational pull on the ocean water nearby. This reduction in gravitational attraction causes sea level to fall close to the (now less-massive) ice sheet while causing sea level to rise farther away. Melt from a&#160;polar ice sheet therefore raises sea level most in the opposite hemisphere or in low latitudes&#160;&#8211; amounting to tens of centimetres difference in rise between regions by 2100.</span></div></body></html>
