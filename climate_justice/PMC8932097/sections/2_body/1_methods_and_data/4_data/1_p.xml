The FIES-based indicators are compiled using the FIES survey module, containing eight questions, which are then used to compute the probabilities of moderate or severe food insecurity and severe food insecurity. FAO collects nationally representative samples of the adult population, once every year beginning in 2014, to develop methods to estimate cross-country comparable prevalence rates of moderate and severe food insecurity. FAO estimates a Rasch model-based scale for each country and data are assessed for consistency to ensure cross-country comparability. The following questions are asked in a FIES module to compute the probabilities of food insecurity.</p>
