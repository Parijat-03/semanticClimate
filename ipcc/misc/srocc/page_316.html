In response to this challenge IWM projects were implemented over large areas in semi-arid biomes over the past few decades. IWM was meant to become a&#160;key factor in meeting a&#160;range of social development goals in many semi-arid rainfed agrarian landscapes in India (Bouma et al. </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.84" top="567.54"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.33; y0: 567.54; y1: 577.04; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="567.54" x1="565.84">2007; Kerr et al. 2002).

Comparisons of catchments with and without IWM projects using remotely sensed data have sometimes shown no signi&#64257; cant enhancement of biomass, in part due to methodological challenges of space for time comparisons (Bhalla et al. 2013). The factors contributing to the successful cases were found to include effective participation of stakeholders in management (Rao 2000; Ratna Reddy et al. 2004).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.8" top="339.56"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 323.22; y0: 339.56; y1: 349.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="339.56" x1="565.8">Attribution of success in soil and water conservation measures was confounded by inadequate monitoring of rainfall variability and lack of catchment hydrologic indicators (Bhalla et al. 2013). Social and economic trade-offs included bias of bene&#64257; ts to downstream crop producers at the expense of pastoralists, women and upstream communities. This biased distribution of IWM bene&#64257; ts could potentially be addressed by compensation for environmental services between communities (Kerr et al. 2002). The successes in some areas also led to increased demand for water, especially groundwater, since there has been no corresponding social regulation of water use after improvement in water regime (Samuel et al. 2007). Policies and management did not ensure water allocation to sectors with the highest social and economic bene&#64257; ts (Batchelor et al. 2003). Limited &#64257; eld evidence of the positive impacts of rainwater harvesting at the local scale is available, but there are several potential negative impacts at the watershed scale (Glendenning et al. 2012). Furthermore, watershed projects are known to have led to more water scarcity, and higher expectations for irrigation water supply, further exacerbating water scarcity (Bharucha et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.8" top="99.59"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 320.07; y0: 99.59; y1: 109.09; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="99.59" x1="565.8">In summary, the mixed performance of IWM projects has been linked to several factors.
