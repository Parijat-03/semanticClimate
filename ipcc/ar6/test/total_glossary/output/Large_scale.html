<p>Any threshold for defining ‘large-scale’ is arbitrary. Understanding of large-scale climate variability and change requires knowledge of both the response to external forcings and the role of internal variability. Many external forcings have substantial hemispheric or continental scale variations. Modes of climate variability are driven by <em>ocean-</em>basin-scale processes. Thus we define large-scale to include ocean-basin and continental scales as well as hemispheric and global scales.</p>
