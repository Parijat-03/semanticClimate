From the Copenhagen Climate Summit to the historical Paris Climate Summit, China has partially embedded the construction of its new Yinling Leading Power identity in leading global climate governance. This changing identity is both reflected in and partly constituted by the way China has come to take up its new leading role in global climate governance. Climate change governance has become one of China&#8217;s prototypical discursive frames in constructing its new international identity through emphasising its role as a global leading actor.</p>
