<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Vulnerability indices are commonly used to prioritize adaptation needs and investments. However, the choice of an index invariably involves trade-offs and challenges. Here, we use extreme heat adaptation in California as a case study to analyze implications for implementing equity-oriented climate adaptations among most vulnerable communities. This study finds that by using CalEnviroScreen 3.0 to designate a census tract&#8217;s status as &#8220;disadvantaged,&#8221; the state does not fully capture community vulnerability to extreme heat, as might be expected. Nuances in the form of extreme heat further obfuscate where adaptation need is greatest given diverging patterns between the type of exposure and vulnerability. We show that, overall, the state has successfully targeted CCI-funded tract interventions to its most &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; communities, but that climate change will likely increase the importance of a holistic approach for adaptation investments that reflects the diversity of the regions, the urban-rural gradient, and the scales of implementation in the state. This work demonstrates that targeted indices (HHAI or CES) and a broader index (SVI) differentially weigh and represent diversity across the large state of California. Therefore on-the-ground validation and integrative applications are vitally important for such quantitative measurements of vulnerability.</p>
