<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0015">Some authors argue that the SDGs strengthen the need for societal transformation (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Blythe et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Shrivastava et al., 2020</xref>), implying a changing role for sustainability scientists from conducting problem-driven applied research to becoming agents of transformation. This is in line with Amartya <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Sen (2013)</xref>, who argues that scientists need to engage in &#8220;informed agitation&#8221; to realize a transition to sustainability. While the co-production model has become the most widespread trope for describing joint knowledge production and for producing usable knowledge for adaptation actions, it lacks a focus on how this happens in practice, what methods for engagement of users are employed, and the extent to which such processes have an impact on policy (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Dannevig et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Mach et al., 2020</xref>). As Mach and colleagues write: &#8220;the practice of co-production is a means of changing how decisions are made by changing who is present in the knowledge-production processes&#8221; (2020: 32). In other words, processes of co-production have the potential to alter existing power relations (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
