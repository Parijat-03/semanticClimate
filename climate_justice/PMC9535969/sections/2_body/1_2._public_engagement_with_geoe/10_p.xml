Similarly, <xref rid="bibr6-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Braman et al. (2012)</xref> found that learning about geoengineering increases participants&#8217; risk perception of climate change. A crucial influencing factor on the acceptability of geoengineering is the trust in science and technology. <xref rid="bibr19-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Macnaghten and Szerszynski (2013)</xref> categorized five general conditions for public acceptance of geoengineering: scientific robustness; research foreseeability; research efficacy; effective governance and democratic condition, including trust in experts and concerns about transparency and democratic accountability.</p>
