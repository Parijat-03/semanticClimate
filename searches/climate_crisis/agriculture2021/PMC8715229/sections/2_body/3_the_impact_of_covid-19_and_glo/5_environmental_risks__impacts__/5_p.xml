A recent survey of protected area (PA) managers noted that Covid-19 had negatively impacted almost all operations, including the investigations of suspected illegal activities, training programs, research and monitoring, protection of endangered species, conservation education and outreach, regular field patrols and anti-poaching operations were reported by the majority of PA managers. The pandemic has, also drastically reduced income through tourism, for instance, in Africa, three quarter of PAs surveyed were fully or partially closed during the pandemic and tourism visitation has dwindled. This, in combination with decrease in government funding, further exacerbated the chronic underfunding and understaffing of protected areas, many of which, according to the survey are facing imminent risk of financial collapse (<xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">Waithaka et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
