Sociologists of youth were caught &#8216;on the backfoot&#8217; (Wood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>, p. 2) by this movement&#8217;s rapid transnational affective contagiousness. In many ways, the School Strikes provided a large-scale example of young people&#8217;s re-invention of political participation (Vromen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>) &#8216;by any media necessary&#8217; on foot and online (Jenkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>). The strikes, however, received polarised responses from politicians, media reporters and online pundits; Greta Thunberg elicited &#8216;enormous support and admiration from supporters and vitriolic abuse from others&#8217; (Bessant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>, p. 3).</p>
