It aims to increase forest/tree cover to the extent of 5&#160;million hectares (Mha) and improve quality of forest/tree cover&#160;on another 5&#160;Mha of forest/non-forest lands and support forest-based livelihoods of 3&#160;million families and generate co-bene&#64257;ts through&#160;ES (Government of India 2010).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.61" top="603.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 603.54; y1: 613.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="603.54" x1="557.61">Thus, the community forest land recognised under FRA can be used for the purpose of compensatory afforestation or restoration under REDD+ only with informed consent of the communities and a&#160;decentralised mechanism for using CAMPA funds.

In 2014, India&#8217;s 14th Finance Commission added forest cover to the formula that determines the amount of tax revenue the central government distributes annually to each of India&#8217;s 29&#160;states. It is estimated that, in four years, it would have distributed&#160;6.9&#8211;12&#160;billion&#160;USD per year to states in proportion to their 2013 forest cover, amounting to around 174&#8211;303&#160;USD per hectare of forest per year (Busch and Mukherjee 2017). State governments in India now have a&#160;sizeable &#64257;scal incentive based on extent of forest cover at the time of policy implementation, contributing to the achievement of India&#8217;s climate mitigation and forest conservation goals. India&#8217;s tax revenue distribution reform has created the world&#8217;s &#64257;rst EFTs for forest conservation, and a&#160;potential model for other countries. However, it is to be noted that EFT is calculated based on a&#160;one-time estimate of forest cover prior to policy implementation, hence does not incentivise ongoing protection and this is a&#160;policy gap. It&#8217;s still too early but its impact on trends in forest cover in the future and its ability to conserve forests without other&#160;investments and policy instruments is promising but untested (Busch and Mukherjee 2017; Busch 2018).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="399.56"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="399.56" x1="557.6">In order to build on the new promising policy developments on forest rights and &#64257;scal incentives for forest conservation in India, incentivising ongoing protection, further investments in monitoring (Busch 2018), decentralisation (Somanathan et al. 2009) and promoting diverse non-agricultural forest and range of land-based livelihoods (e.g., sustainable non-timber forest product extraction, regulated pastures, carbon credits for forest regeneration on marginal agriculture land and ecotourism revenues) as part of individual and community forest tenure and rights are ongoing concerns. Decentralised sharing of CAMPA funds between government and local communities for forest restoration as originally suggested and &#64257;lling in implementation gaps could help reconcile climate change mitigation through forest conservation, REDD+ and environmental justice (Vijge and Gupta 2014; Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013; Badola et al. 2013; Sun and Chaturvedi 2016; Murthy et al. 2018b; Chopra 2017; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India 2010).</span></div></body></html>
