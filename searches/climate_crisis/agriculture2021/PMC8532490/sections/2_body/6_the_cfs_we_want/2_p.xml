The CFS and CSM are charged with &#8216;informing accountability for all stakeholders, including the private sector&#8217; in the UNSG&#8217;s Statement of Action. But how can they deliver on this in a fragmented, fractured climate of global governance where the interests of wealthy, powerful actors ride roughshod over the well-being of the majority?</p>
