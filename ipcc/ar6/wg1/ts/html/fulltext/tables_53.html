      <td>Human-caused climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water cycle since the mid-20th century (high\nconfidence), and it is projected to cause substantial further changes at both global and regional scales (high confidence).\nGlobal land precipitation has likely increased since 1950, with a faster increase since the 1980s (medium confidence).\nAtmospheric water vapour has increased throughout the troposphere since at least the 1980s (likely). Annual global\nland precipitation will increase over the 21st century as global surface temperature increases (high confidence).\nHuman influence has been detected in amplified surface salinity and precipitation minus evaporation (P&#8211;E) patterns\nover the ocean (high confidence).\nThe severity of very wet and very dry events increase in a warming climate (high confidence), but changes in\natmospheric circulation patterns affect where and how often these extremes occur. Water cycle variability and related\nextremes are projected to increase faster than mean changes in most regions of the world and under all emissions\nscenarios (high confidence).\nOver the 21st century, the total land area subject to drought will increase and droughts will become more frequent\nand severe (high confidence). Near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain mainly because of internal\nvariability, model uncertainty and uncertainty in forcings from natural and anthropogenic aerosols (medium\nconfidence).\nOver the 21st century and beyond, abrupt human-caused changes to the water cycle cannot be excluded (medium\nconfidence). {2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9}</td>

      <td>There is high confidence that the global water cycle has intensified since at least 1980 expressed by, for example, increased atmospheric\nmoisture fluxes and amplified precipitation minus evaporation patterns. Global land precipitation has likely increased since 1950,\nwith a faster increase since the 1980s (medium confidence), and a likely human contribution to patterns of change, particularly for\nincreases in high-latitude precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere. Increases in global mean precipitation are determined by a\nrobust response to global surface temperature (very likely 2&#8211;3% per &#176;C) that is partly offset by fast atmospheric adjustments to\natmospheric heating by greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols (Section TS.3.2.2). The overall effect of anthropogenic aerosols is\nto reduce global precipitation through surface radiative cooling effects (high confidence). Over much of the 20th century, opposing\neffects of GHGs and aerosols on precipitation have been observed for some regional monsoons (high confidence) (Box TS.13). Global\nannual precipitation over land is projected to increase on average by 2.4% (&#8211;0.2% to +4.7% likely range) under SSP1-1.9, 4.6% (1.5%\nto 8.3% likely range) under SSP2-4.5, and 8.3% (0.9% to 12.9% likely range) under SSP5-8.5 by 2081&#8211;2100 relative to 1995&#8211;2014\n(Box TS.6, Figure 1). Inter-model differences and internal variability contribute to a substantial range in projections of large-scale and\nregional water cycle changes (high confidence). The occurrence of volcanic eruptions can alter the water cycle for several years (high\nconfidence). Projected patterns of precipitation change exhibit substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast as global surface\ntemperature increases over the 21st century (Box TS.6, Figure 1). {2.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.5.2, 4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, Cross-Chapter\nBox 4.1, 8.2.1, 8.2.2, 8.2.3, Box 8.1, 8.3.2.4, 8.4.1, 8.5.2, 10.4.2}</td>

      <td>Global total column water vapour content has very likely increased since the 1980s, and it is likely that human influence has contributed\nto tropical upper tropospheric moistening. Near-surface specific humidity has increased over the ocean (likely) and land (very likely)\nsince at least the 1970s, with a detectable human influence (medium confidence). Human influence has been detected in amplified\nsurface salinity and precipitation minus evaporation (P&#8211;E) patterns over the ocean (high confidence). It is virtually certain that\nevaporation will increase over the ocean and very likely that evapotranspiration will increase over land, with regional variations under\nfuture surface warming (Box TS.6, Figure 1). There is high confidence that projected increases in precipitation amount and intensity will\nbe associated with increased runoff in northern high latitudes (Box TS.6, Figure 1). In response to cryosphere changes (Section TS.2.5),\nthere have been changes in streamflow seasonality, including an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow in high-latitude and mountain\ncatchments (high confidence). Projected runoff (Box TS.6, Figure 1c) is typically decreased by contributions from small glaciers because\nof glacier mass loss, while runoff from larger glaciers will generally increase with increasing global warming levels until their mass\nbecomes depleted (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.5.2, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, 11.5}</td>
