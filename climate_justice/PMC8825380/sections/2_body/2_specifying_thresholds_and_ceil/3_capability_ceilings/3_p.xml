For instance, versions of <italic>sufficientarianism</italic> includes upper limits beyond which further distribution is not required (Crisp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>). That is, including the entitlements or claims of an agent, B, is only appropriate &#8216;up to the point at which B has a level of welfare such that B can live a life which is sufficiently good&#8217; (Crisp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>: 762). This version of sufficientarianism is however limited to the claims of an agent playing a reduced role when determining what is required by justice once that agent is above a level recommended by sufficientarianism. In contrast, and more similar to capability ceilings, <italic>limitarianism</italic> recommends a firm upper level, beyond which any surplus not required for a fully flourishing life is to be devoted to increasing the well-being of others (Robeyns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>).</p>
