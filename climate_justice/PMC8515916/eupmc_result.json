Low-and middle-income countries bear the brunt of the health impacts of climate change and migration, despite their overall low contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The CIH<sup>LMU</sup> Symposium 2021 aimed to explore the complex interconnections between climate change, migration and health from diverse global perspectives. A number of themes, such as the relationship between climate and trade, the role of technology, and the issue of responsibility were tackled. The speakers also highlighted the need for climate resilient health-systems, gender mainstreaming in climate strategies, collaboration between the Global North and South and urgently defining the 'climate refugee'. It is crucial that the narrative around climate change moves from an environmental framing to encompass human health and migration within climate discussions and strategies.", "affiliation": "Teaching & Training Unit, Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU, Munich, Germany. wandini.lutchmun@lrz.uni-muenchen.de.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["meeting-report", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Global Health", "Climate Resilience", "Climate Justice", "Climate Migration"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12919-021-00225-4"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8515916"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8515916?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-10-14", "firstIndexDate": "2021-10-15", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-10-29", "dateOfRevision": "2021-10-23", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-10-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-10-12"}
