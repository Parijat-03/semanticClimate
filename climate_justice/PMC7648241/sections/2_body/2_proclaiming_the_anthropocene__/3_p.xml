A call for declaring a climate emergency (Lenton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>) is, in this respect, a <italic>political</italic> attempt by scientists to warn about how little time is left to avoid such a catastrophic scenario. A problem is however that there is little attention paid to the human societies, which are seen as an integral part of the Earth System (Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). Like a well-known German sociologist Ulrich Beck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>) said: &#8220;If &#8216;the environment&#8217; only includes everything which is not human, not social, then the concept is sociologically empty.&#8221;</p>
