Each one of us has a responsibility to preserve the planet for our own betterment and to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. The Government cannot be immune to this urgent task. Delhi is one of the fastest growing urban centers of the country. It faces the issues of ever-increasing population, urbanization, pollution, depleting natural resources and ultimately Climate Change.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.01" top="631.08"><span x0="72.02" y0="631.08" x1="508.01" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 631.08; y1: 642.12; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Government of NCT of Delhi has adopted best practices in various sectors including Transport, Energy Conservation, Health, Education, Water Conservation, Greening, Waste Management, etc. Delhi Government has taken number of initiatives for instance preparation of the green vision in line with the global Sustainable Development Goals and then the Green Budget to carefully plan the allocation of the financial resources for the development priorities with due consideration of the natural resources, environment and climate change.

It is important to prepare a long-term strategy since it is expected and believed that the climate change may undermine our development efforts with adverse consequences across the board on our people&#8217;s livelihood, the environment in which they live and work and their personal health and welfare. Considering a vital need for a better strategy, Delhi Government has prepared this State Level Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC). Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC sets forth the ways considering the need for combating climate change. We have outlined our progress and future plan of actions across all of the development sectors. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.14" top="325.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="325.63" x1="508.14" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 75.7; y0: 325.63; y1: 336.67; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">I am pleased to see that the various departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi have worked together and contributed in the preparation of Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC. Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC has been prepared so as to set up a common but shared agenda for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This State Action Plan is a document which aims to connect between evolving climate science, policies and practices. The Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC is a dynamic and flexible document and would be subject to periodic review so as to revisit the suggested strategies and constantly refine them. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.04" top="223.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="223.72" x1="508.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 75.7; y0: 223.72; y1: 234.76; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">I hope that the priorities identified under the SAPCC will lead to sound implementation of strategies that will help to address the challenge of climate change in the State and ensure a future of sustainable development. The aim is to sets out sector specfici actions, which are achievable in the next few years in the context of our developmental priorities to achieve the objectives of sustainable, resilience and liveable society.   </span></div></body></html>
