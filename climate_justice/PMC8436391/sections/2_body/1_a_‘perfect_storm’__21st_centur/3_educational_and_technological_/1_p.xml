<p>In an educational context, social work authors note some adverse impacts of neoliberalism on
social work university education in Australia and internationally. Neoliberal approaches to
education promote individual success in an economy that rewards competition, self-interest and
self-reliance, undermining the critical and emancipatory vision of higher education (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2020</xref>). In Australia, these impacts are evident
through the alignment of universities with the national government&#8217;s performance-based
funding model (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Tehan, 2019</xref>) and the pursuit of
&#8216;employability&#8217;, &#8216;job-ready graduates&#8217; and &#8216;career and
future focused&#8217; teaching.</p>
