<p>Rather than recognizing the horrors of Floyd&#8217;s murder and the long&#8208;standing suffering of African Americans, Trump resorted to a law&#8208;and&#8208;order trope. He accused the governors of being weak if they wouldn&#8217;t dominate the demonstrations and he sent in the military if he deemed it necessary to restore order. George Floyd&#8217;s murder, within the context of Trump&#8217;s behaviour in the pandemic, set the stage for a surreal scene at the White House on 1 June 2020.
