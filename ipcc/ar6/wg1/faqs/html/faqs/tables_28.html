As more CO accumulates in the atmosphere,\n2\nplant carbon capture increases through the CO\n2\nfertilization effect in regions where plant growth is not\nlimited by, for instance, nutrient availability. Climate\nchange affects the processes responsible for the uptake\nand release of CO on land in multiple ways. Land CO\n2 2\nuptake is generally increased by longer growing seasons\ndue to global warming in cold regions and by nitrogen\ndeposition in nitrogen-limited regions.
