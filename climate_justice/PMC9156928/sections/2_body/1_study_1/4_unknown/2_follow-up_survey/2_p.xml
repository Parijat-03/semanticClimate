<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">After five months, only 7% (three) of the 40 participants reported having attended between one and five activism events organized by the UCSD Green New Deal (climate organization), and one participant said they attended three events at the not-monitored organization Grove. Based on the attendance records of UCSD Green New Deal, we confirmed that one participant became a sustained member of the organization. It was not possible to verify attendance for the other two participants. However, not all the organization's events happening over those five months required sign-up sheets, so it is unknown whether they participated in one of the unmonitored events. Regardless, event attendance was nearly zero after the study.</p>
