Here, we forward a set of &#8216;pillars&#8217; from which to rebuild the global economy, based on principles of a shared sustainable prosperity. The evidence on the need to do so is now over-whelming. Humanity is facing a crisis of unprecedented scale and complexity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and United Nations have repeatedly shed light on the emergency in successive reports. Total green house gases (GHG) emissions reached a record high of 59.1 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent in 2019 (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>). While global emissions dropped by an unprecedented 5.4% in 2020, emissions are rapidly returning to pre-COVID-19 levels (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2021</xref>). Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)&#160;concentrations in the atmosphere reached a record daily high of 421.59 ppm on 14th February 2022 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>). We face a likely temperature rise of 2.7 &#176;C by 2100 (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2021</xref>), equating to a planetary-scale emergency characterized by an acute level of risk and urgency (Lenton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p>
