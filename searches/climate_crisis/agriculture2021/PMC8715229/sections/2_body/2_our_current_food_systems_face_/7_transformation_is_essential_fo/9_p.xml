However, sustainable pathways will require many of these levers to be combined for the world to be put on track to achieve the SDGs. For instance, in the case of biodiversity, only a combination of these levers would allow biodiversity to recover from its long-term downward trend (<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Lecl&#232;re et al., 2020</xref>). A report by the Food and Land Use Coalition (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>) identifies ten crucial transformations, where the required magnitude of change is informed by the modeling of sustainability pathways. These transformations cover several of the domains described above, while also discussing enabling conditions, such as global and local governance, the mobilization of digital technology and the inclusiveness of society. A recent report of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) similarly illustrates the importance of mobilizing a number of actions to achieve the required level of food system transformation (<xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
