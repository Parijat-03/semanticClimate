This is despite a huge gap<xref rid="newe12203-note-0007" ref-type="fn">

</xref> between the amount of fossil fuels that we know can be burned if we're going to stay below 1.5&#176;C or even 2&#176;C of warming, and the planned production of fossil fuels in the next decade. In fact, the words &#8216;fossil fuels&#8217; don't even appear in the Paris Agreement. It's long past time to change that. The managed decline of the fossil fuel industry needs to be part of every multilateral discussion from now on. Governments not only need to ensure that production is phased out at a rate that is commensurate with addressing the climate crisis; they also need to ensure a just transition for workers and communities who will be affected by the decline of those industries. There will be no climate justice unless we can do both of those things.</p>
