In addition, flooding and food insecurity may be associated with migration, leading to the expansion of sexual networks and creating conditions conducive to intravenous drug use or exposure to gender-based violence.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Another possible mechanistic pathway for our findings is that flooding or excessive rains can block access to clinics or cause damage to public health infrastructure, weakening access to health resources such as pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV testing, education, and treatment. This hypothesized pathway is speculative, however, given that there are no published findings to our knowledge.</p>
