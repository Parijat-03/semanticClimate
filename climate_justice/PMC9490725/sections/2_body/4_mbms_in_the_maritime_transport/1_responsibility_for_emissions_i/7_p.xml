The EU scheme aims to include all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from ships sailing between or berthed at EU ports, and 50% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between EU and non-EU ports. The amount of these emissions needing to be covered by ETS permits will be phased in gradually up to 100% by 2026 (Psaraftis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2021</xref>).</p>
