However, by undertaking a counterfactual analysis, we are able to quantify the extent to which climate change is reversing the gains in food security that would otherwise have been realised, most likely through policies addressing poverty reduction and economic growth. We find that for all four regions, climate change appears to have had a non-trivial impact on food insecurity. Though the changes may appear relatively small, these changes have occurred over a short period of time, and the negative impacts on food security are likely to increase yet further as temperatures continue to rise. Our findings contribute to the growing focus on loss and damage, and the extent to which climate stressors are affecting Sustainable Development Goals, including food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our findings may also provide a partial explanation as to why, despite falling global poverty rates, both the percentage and the absolute number of undernourished people have started to increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
