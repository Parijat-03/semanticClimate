Overall, while de&#64257;ning and presenting the response options to meet these goals is the primary goal of this chapter, we note that these options must not be considered only as technological interventions, or one-off actions. Rather, they need to be understood as responses to socio-ecological challenges whose success will largely depend on external enabling factors. There have been many previous efforts at compiling positive response options that meet numerous SDGs, but which have not resulted in major shifts in implementation; for example, online databases of multiple response options for sustainable land management (SLM), adaptation, and other objectives have been compiled by many donor agencies, including World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), Climate Adapt, and the Adaptation Knowledge Portal (Schwilch et&#160;al. 2012b).</span><span style="x0: 545.02; x1: 548.22; y0: 511.44; y1: 518.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="545.02" y0="511.44" x1="548.22">3</span><span style="x0: 550.7; x1: 555.62; y0: 507.52; y1: 517.02; width: 4.92; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="550.7" y0="507.52" x1="566.09">Yet, clearly barriers to adoption remain, or these actions would have been more widely used by now. Much of the scienti&#64257;c literature on barriers to implementing response options focuses on the individual and household level, and discusses limits to adoption, often primarily identi&#64257;ed as economic factors (Nigussie et&#160;al. 2017; Dallimer et&#160;al.&#160;2018). While a useful approach, such studies are often unable to account for the larger enabling factors that might assist in more wide-scale implementation (Chapter 7 discusses these governance factors and associated barriers in more detail).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="375.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 375.54; y1: 385.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="375.54" x1="566.07">Instead, this chapter proposes that each response option identi&#64257;ed and assessed needs to be understood as an intervention within complex socio-ecological systems (SES) (introduced in Chapter 1). In this understanding, physical changes affect human decision-making over land and risk management options, as do economics, policies, and cultural factors, which in turn may drive additional ecological change (Rawlins and Morris 2010). This co-evolution of responses within an SES provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics between drivers of change and impacts of interventions. Thus, in discussions of the 40 speci&#64257;c response options in this chapter, it must be kept in mind that all need to be contextualised within the speci&#64257;c SES in which they are deployed (Figure 6.1). Framing response options within SESs also recognises the interactions </span><span style="x0: 434.8; x1: 439.37; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="434.8" y0="231.55" x1="467.53">between </span><span style="x0: 468.57; x1: 473.14; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="468.57" y0="231.55" x1="566.13">different response options. However, a major problem within SESs is that the choice and use of different response options requires knowledge of the problems they are aimed at solving, which may be unclear, contested, or not shared equally among stakeholders (Carmenta et&#160;al. 2017). Drivers of environmental change often have primarily social or economic, rather than technological roots, which requires acknowledgement that the response options not aimed at reducing the drivers of change may thus be less successful (Schwilch et&#160;al. 2014).</span></div></body></html>
