Thus, adaptation options need to provide management approaches and policies that build the livelihood asset base, reducing vulnerability to multiple stressors with a&#160;multi-sector perspective (Badjeck et al. 2010). In Bangladesh, fishing pressure on post-larval prawns has increased as displaced farmers have shifted to fishing following salt-water intrusion of agricultural land (Ahmed et al. 2013). In West Africa, strategies to cope with sudden shifts in fisheries are wider-reaching and have included turning to seafood import (Gephart et al. 2017) or terrestrial food production, including farming and bush-meat hunting on land (Brashares et al. 2004). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="519.12"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 519.12; y1: 528.62; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="519.12" x1="313.24">Proposed actions for adaptation include effective governance, improved management and conservation, efforts to maximise societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of distribution and innovation in food production, and the continued development of low-input and low-impact aquaculture (FAO 2018c). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="447.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 447.13; y1: 456.63; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="447.13" x1="313.23">Particular adaptation strategies proposed by FAO (2014a) include diverse and flexible livelihood strategies, such as introduction of fish ponds in areas susceptible to intermittent flood/drought periods; flood-friendly small-scale homestead bamboo pens with trap doors allowing seasonal floods to occur without loss of stocked fish; cage fish aquaculture development using plankton feed in reservoirs created by dam building; supporting the transition to different species, polyculture and integrated systems, allowing for diversified and more resilient systems; promotion of combined rice and fish farming systems that reduce overall water needs and provide integrated pest management; and supporting transitions to alternative livelihoods. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="303.15"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 303.15; y1: 312.65; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="303.15" x1="313.26">Risk reduction initiatives include innovative weather-based insurance schemes being tested for applicability in aquaculture and fisheries and climate risk assessments introduced for integrated coastal zone management. For aquaculture&#8217;s contribution to building resilient food systems, Troell et al. (2014) found that aquaculture could potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. Yet, its high reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites and its environmental impacts reduce this potential. For instance, the increase in aquaculture worldwide may enhance land competition for feed crops, increasing price levels and volatility and worsening food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="187.63" top="134.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 134.98; y1: 144.98; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="134.98" x1="187.63">1.3.3.4 Transport and storage</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.27" top="111.11"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 111.11; y1: 120.61; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="111.11" x1="313.27">Fewer studies have been done on adaptation of food system transport and storage compared to the many studies on adaptation to climate in food production. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="365.92" top="735.11"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.29; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="735.11" x1="365.92">Transport. </span><span style="x0: 367.4; x1: 373.22; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="367.4" y0="735.11" x1="571.75">One transport example is found in Bangkok. Between mid-November 2011 and early January 2012, Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, faced its most dramatic flood in approximately 70&#160;years with most transport networks cut-off or destroyed. This caused large-scale disruption of the national food supply chains since they were centrally organised in the capital city (Allen et al. 2017). From this experience, the construction and management of &#8216;climate-proof&#8217; rural roads and transport networks is argued as one the most important adaptation strategies for climate change and food security in Thailand (Rattanachot et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="603.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 603.13; y1: 612.63; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="603.13" x1="571.77">Similarly in Africa, it has been shown that enhanced transportation networks combined with other measures could reduce the impact of climate change on food and nutrition security (Brown et al. 2017b). This suggests that strengthening infrastructure and logistics for transport would significantly enhance resilience to climate change, while improving food and nutrition security in developing counties. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="359.16" top="519.14"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.47; y0: 519.14; y1: 528.64; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="519.14" x1="359.16">Storage. </span><span style="x0: 361.43; x1: 365.64; y0: 519.14; y1: 528.64; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="361.43" y0="519.14" x1="571.74">Storage refers to both structures and technologies for storing seed as well as produce. Predominant storage methods used in Uganda are single-layer woven polypropylene bags (popularly called &#8216;kavera&#8217; locally), chemical insecticides and granaries. Evidence from Omotilewa et al. (2018) showed that the introduction of new storage technology called Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) could contribute to climate change adaptation. PICS is a&#160;chemical-free airtight triple-layered technology consisting of two high-density polyethylene inner liners and one outer layer of woven polypropylene bag. Its adoption has increased the number of households planting hybrid maize varieties that are more susceptible to insect pests in storage than traditional lower-yielding varieties. Such innovations could help to protect crops more safely and for longer periods from postharvest insect pests that are projected to increase as result of climate change, thus contributing to food security. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="327.16"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 327.16; y1: 336.66; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="327.16" x1="571.74">In the Indo-Gangetic Plain many different storage structures based on ILK provide reliable and low-cost options made of local materials.
