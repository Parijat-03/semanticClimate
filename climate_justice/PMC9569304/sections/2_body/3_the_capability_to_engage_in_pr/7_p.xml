If we endorse capabilities as the appropriate metric of justice, we want to make sure we have fair opportunities for well-being, which requires that society is organized in such a way that the most important capabilities are secured. Procreative parenting is such a capability. If we are endorsing capabilities as the metric of distributive justice and are asking what a just society would look like, and we know that many people care deeply about procreative parenting and have very good reasons for doing so, then surely we would think that a just society should be a society in which the opportunity or capability to procreate would be protected, including in the sense that we shouldn&#8217;t have to pay an excessive price if we want to use that opportunity.</p>
