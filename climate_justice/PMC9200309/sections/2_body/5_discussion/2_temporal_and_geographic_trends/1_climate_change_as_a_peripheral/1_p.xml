<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate Change Litigation (CCL) has gained prominence over the past three decades as a &#8220;governance mechanism for addressing climate change&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United States, climate legal action began as a means to hold actors accountable for activities knowingly contributing to GHG emissions exceeding national guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Our database searches identified that between 1986 and the end of May 2020, a total of 1,587 cases of CCL worldwide had been brought before courts, with 1,213 (76%) cases in the United States and 374 cases in 36 other countries and eight regional or international jurisdictions. Out of this total we found 65 directly linked public health cases. With the mounting climate crisis unfolding, CCL continues to be a growing field of law that intersects International and National Environmental Law, International Human Rights Law, and a complex range of statutes, regulations, and legal principals spanning national, subnational and, in some countries, constitutional law.</p>
