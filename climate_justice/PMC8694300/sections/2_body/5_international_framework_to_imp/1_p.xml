<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A program of global climate reparations requires an international mechanism for implementation. There is an existing institution&#8212;the Green Climate Fund (GCF)&#8212;intended to provide economic assistance to low-income countries detrimentally affected by climate change. The GCF was agreed to by the Conference of the Parties in 2010 under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It became operational a few years later, with administrative offices located in Incheon, South Korea.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> It is currently the largest international fund dedicated to fighting climate change. Part of its mandate is to assist low-income countries in mitigating and adapting to climate change through project design and implementation.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Its 24-member board has equal representation from low- and high-income countries. Its funds are derived from public and private sources, including multilateral, regional and national development agencies; international and national banks; and private equity institutions.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> It should be noted that the GCF operates on technical and economic grounds, not ethical or human rights principles.</p>
