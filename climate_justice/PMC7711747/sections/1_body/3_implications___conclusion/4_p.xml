<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par99">Our curriculum explored the successful beginnings of a student/faculty co-creation and collaboration. This is not to say there were not tensions between expert and novice and between discovery and direction. For a successful blend of bottom-up and top-down interaction, multiple components must come together under mutual respect, common understanding, and shared responsibility. Learner agency, increased satisfaction with the academy, and heightened engagement came with the author&#8217;s participation of a curriculum design. The institution was provided with insights into students&#8217; perspective and needs as well as enhanced capacity to promote a holistic engagement with learners.</p>
