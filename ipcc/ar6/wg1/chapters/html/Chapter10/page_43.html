A&#160;climate model&#8217;s credibility for future projections may be increased if the model is able to simulate past variations in climate (Sections 10.3.3.8, 10.4.1 and 10.6; Flato et&#160;al., 2014). In particular, the credibility of downscaled information depends on the quality of both the downscaling method and of the global model providing the large-scale boundary conditions (Flato et&#160;al., 2014). Credibility is closely linked to the concept of adequacy or fitness-for-purpose (Section&#160;1.5.4.1; Parker, 2009). From a&#160;regional perspective, one may ask about the fitness of a&#160;climate model for simulating future changes of specific aspects of a&#160;specific regional climate. The required level of model fitness may depend on the user context (Section&#160;10.5). A&#160;key challenge is to link performance at representing present and past climate (Sections 10.3.3.3&#8211;10.3.3.8) to the confidence in future projections (Section&#160;1.3.5; Baumberger et&#160;al., 2017) and it is addressed in this subsection.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.7" top="438.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="438.6" x1="304.7" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A general idea of model fitness for a&#160;given application may be obtained by checking whether relevant large- (Section&#160;10.3.3.4) and regional-scale (Sections 10.3.3.5 and 10.3.3.6) processes are explicitly resolved (Figure&#160;10.3). The basis for confidence in climate projection is a&#160;solid process understanding (Flato et&#160;al., 2014; Baumberger et&#160;al., 2017). Thus, the key to assessing the fitness-for-purpose of a&#160;model is the evaluation of how relevant processes controlling regional climate are represented (Collins et&#160;al., 2018). A&#160;process-based evaluation may be more appropriate than an evaluation of the variables of interest (e.g.,&#160;temperature, precipitation), because biases in the latter may in principle be reduced if the underlying processes are realistically simulated (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.2), while individual variables may appear as well-represented because of compensating errors (Flato et&#160;al., 2014; Baumberger et&#160;al., 2017). Combining a&#160;process-based evaluation with a&#160;mechanistic explanation of projected changes further increases confidence in projections (Bukovsky et&#160;al., 2017). Fitness-for-purpose can also be assessed by comparing the simulated response of a&#160;model with simulations of higher resolution models that better represent relevant processes (Baumberger et&#160;al., 2017). For instance, Giorgi et&#160;al. (2016) have corroborated their findings on precipitation changes comparing standard RCM simulations with convection-permitting simulations.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="302.46" top="162.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="162.6" x1="302.46" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The evaluation of model performance at historical variability and long-term changes provides further relevant information (Flato&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2014). Trend evaluation may provide very useful insight, but has limitations, in particular at the regional scale, mainly due to multi-decadal internal climate variability (Section&#160;10.3.3.8), observational uncertainty (in&#160;both driving reanalysis and local trends; Section&#160;10.2), and the fact that often not all regional forcings are known, and that past trends&#160;may be driven by forcings other than those driving future trends (Sections 10.4.1 and 10.6.3).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.07; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">may be particularly important when it modifies the climate change signal of a&#160;lower resolution model in a&#160;physically plausible way (Hall, 2014). Improvements may result from a&#160;better representation of regional processes, upscale effects, as well as the possibility of a&#160;region-specific model tuning (S&#248;rland et&#160;al., 2018). For instance, Gula and Peltier (2012) showed that a&#160;higher resolution allows for a&#160;more realistic simulation of lake-induced precipitation, resulting in a&#160;more credible projection of changes in the snow belts of the North American Great Lakes. Similarly, Giorgi et&#160;al. (2016) demonstrated that an ensemble of RCMs better represents high-elevation surface heating and in turn increased convective instability. As a&#160;result, the summer convective precipitation response was opposite to that simulated by the driving global models (Figure&#160;10.9). Similarly, Walton et&#160;al. (2015) showed that a&#160;kilometre-scale RCM enables a&#160;more realistic representation of the snow-albedo feedback in mountainous terrain compared to standard resolution global models, leading to a&#160;more plausible simulation of elevation-dependent warming. Bukovsky et&#160;al. (2017) argue that strong seasonal changes in warm-season precipitation in the Southern Great Plains of the USA, projected by RCMs, are more credible than the weaker global model changes because precipitation is better simulated in the RCMs.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="450.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="450.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 450.6; y1: 460.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Including additional components, feedbacks and drivers can substantially modify the simulated future climate. For example, Kjellstr&#246;m et&#160;al. (2005) and Somot et&#160;al. (2008) have shown that a&#160;regional ESM can significantly modify the SST response to climate change of its driving global model with implications for the climate&#160;change signal over both the sea and land. In particular, coupled ocean&#8211;atmosphere RCMs may increase the credibility of projections in regions of strong air-sea coupling such as the East Asia&#8211;western North Pacific domain (Zou and Zhou, 2016b, 2017). Recent studies demonstrate the importance of including regional patterns of evolving aerosols in RCMs for simulating regional climate change (Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020a; Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2020).
