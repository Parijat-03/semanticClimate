<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the course of the twentieth century, far-reaching redistributive land policies were carried out across the world based on specific economic imperatives (Akram-Lodhi et al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; de Janvry, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Griffin et al., <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Kay, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2002a</xref>; Thiesenhusen, <xref rid="CIT0098" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>), on political arguments such as ending violence (Fajardo, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kay, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), or to further democratization (Fox, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). These arguments remain urgent and relevant today, but have less political force despite the pressing need for such policies. A social justice-oriented strategy for combating climate change could be a powerful argument in support of redistributive land policies, but the current dominant narrative points in the opposite direction, undermining broad-based, genuinely democratic land policies.</p>
