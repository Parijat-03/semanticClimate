<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The primary health-care level is where health and community action intersect most closely, with health workers and managers based in primary care facilities going into communities for outreach programmes and health awareness campaigns. This community&#8211;health interface provides an entry point contributing to social capital and resilience to the climate crisis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Ensuring responsive public health and preventive and curative health services requires community empowerment and mobilization. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic demonstrates the importance of community engagement for effective public health action.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> As well, the youth-led global movement to fight climate change and force policy-makers to recognize the climate emergency is growing. Primary health care thus represents an opportunity to capture synergies and strengthen and mobilize communities to deliver the public goods valued by both individuals and societies: health today and for future generations. Many social participation mechanisms for health currently exist, providing potential to foster grassroots engagement on the climate crisis more holistically. Such efforts provide opportunities to operationalize and capitalize on the connections between primary health care and the climate crisis.</p>
