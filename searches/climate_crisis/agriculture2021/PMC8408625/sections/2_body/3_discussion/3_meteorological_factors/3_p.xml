<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0175">Our analysis of the mean winter temperature (Dec&#8211;Feb) reveals a quadratic relationship with WNV and is one of the main predictors of annual WNV infections in the model. Temperatures below 2&#160;&#176;C and above 6&#160;&#176;C have a negative association with WNV infections. These results are consistent with findings by Koenraadt et al., 2019 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, who found that diapausing <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> mosquitoes do not necessarily do better under warmer conditions and there is a temperature range in which they can successfully diapause. Furthermore, other authors suggest <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> that outbreaks may be more intense following winters with optimal temperatures for diapausing mosquitoes. Since a larger number of mosquitoes can successfully survive the winter, and those that are infected with WNV can transmit it earlier on in the year, leading to increased disease prevalence in mosquitoes and reservoir bird species than in years when winter conditions are not optimal. It is also important to note that it is not currently clear at what temperatures <italic>Culex modestus</italic> and <italic>Coquillettidia richiardii</italic> overwinter as adults since our literature search did not yield any findings.</p>
