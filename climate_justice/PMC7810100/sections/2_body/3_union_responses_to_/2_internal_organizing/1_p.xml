Additionally, unions prioritized meeting with new employees to educate them about the union. The outreach was designed to obtain, engage, and reengage members, determining their priorities in order to more effectively meet their needs (Hodges and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>, 67). In addition to listening to the members and educating them about union activities, unions formed membership action teams and employed direct actions to build solidarity and press member priorities (Hodges and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>, 67). These activities have included rallies, press conferences, distribution of literature, informational pickets and attendance at public meetings (Hodges and Malin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>, 67). As just one example, in Virginia, long a right-to-work state, a transit union increased its membership by 200 members, achieving an 85% membership rate using these tactics (Ertl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>).</p>
