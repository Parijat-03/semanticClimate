Necessary equipment was purchased, and interviews with the first guests were scheduled. The podcast was first released in February 2020. Since its launch, 40 episodes were produced in the first season, which consisted of nine months. Each episode is approximately one hour long. The format of the interviews is one-on-one conversations between the host, Sapna Mulki, and the guest.</p>
