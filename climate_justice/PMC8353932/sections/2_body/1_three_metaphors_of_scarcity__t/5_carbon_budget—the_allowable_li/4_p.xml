For climate activists like Bill McKibben,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> the remarkably small size of the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C target means more than a mere estimate by the modelling. It is often referred to as the &#8216;gospel of science&#8217; that unbiasedly tells us how little amount of CO<sub>2</sub> can be emitted in order to avert the climate crisis. The small number of carbon budget reveals the &#8216;inconvenient truth&#8217; that a vast amount of fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground as &#8216;unburnable carbon&#8217; (Strauch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Importantly, the number can be trusted because it has been &#8216;authorised&#8217; by IPCC assessment.</p>
