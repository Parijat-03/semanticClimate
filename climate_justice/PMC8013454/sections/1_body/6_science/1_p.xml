He demonstrates that not only are the constituents of mainstream climate movements predominantly white, male and from privileged classes, but that climate science is also equally biased. In his piece, Franz Krause grapples with the fact that anthropological insights and expertise are not taken up by policy makers and institutions involved in the fight against climate change. Similarly, anthropological expertise has been largely absent in dealings with the Covid&#8208;19 pandemic. Worried about this trend, he suggests that anthropologists highlight paths from their research insights to policy changes.</p>
