While equity concerns intersect multiple sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, we find that cities&#8217; attention to justice is not distributed uniformly across policy areas (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The most common sectors where cities connect mitigation to justice concerns are energy efficiency (47 out 57 plans addressing this sector incorporate justice), clean energy (36 out of 57), and land use and transport (34 out of 54). In contrast, less than half of the cities we analysed link justice to policies related to waste (21 out of 50), electric vehicles (17 out of 48), water (4 out of 21), and air quality (2 out of 5). Although relatively few cities address urban greening and food as part of their mitigation strategies, more than half of these cities connect these policy areas to justice (15 out of 29 and 12 out of 18, respectively).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Attention to climate justice by mitigation sectors.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Number of cities that articulate justice in each mitigation sector.
