      <td>Biomass in 2013 contributed about 60 EJ (10%) to global primary energy4 (WBA 2016). In 2011, the IPCC Special Report on Renewable\nEnergy Sources concluded that biomass supply for energy could reach 100&#8211;300 EJ yr&#8211;1 by 2050 with the caveat that the technical\npotential5 cannot be determined precisely while societal preferences are unclear; that deployment depends on &#8216;factors that are\ninherently uncertain&#8217;; and that biomass use could evolve in a &#8216;sustainable&#8217; or &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; way, depending on the governance\ncontext (IPCC 2012). The IPCC WGIII AR5 report noted, in addition, that high deployment levels would require extensive use of\ntechnologies able to convert lignocellulosic biomass such as forest wood, agricultural residues, and lignocellulosic crops. The IPCC Special\nReport on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (SR15) noted that high levels of bioenergy deployment may result in adverse side effects for food\nsecurity, ecosystems, biodiversity, water use, and nutrients (de Coninck et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>Although estimates of potential are uncertain, there is high confidence that the most important factors determining future\nbiomass supply are land availability and land productivity. These factors are, in turn, determined by competing uses of land and\na myriad of environmental and economic considerations (Dornburg et al. 2010; Batidzirai et al. 2012; Erb et al. 2012; Slade 2014,\nSearle and Malins 2014). Overlaying estimates of technical potential with such considerations invariably results in a smaller estimate.\nRecent studies that have attempted to do this estimate that 50&#8211;244 EJ biomass could be produced on 0.1&#8211;13 Mkm2 (Fuss et al. 2018;\nSchueler et al. 2016; Searle and Malins 2014; IPCC 2018; Wu et al. 2019; Heck et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018). While preferences\nconcerning economic, social and environmental objectives vary geographically and over time, studies commonly estimate &#8216;sustainable&#8217;\npotentials by introducing restrictions intended to protect environmental values and avoid negative effects on poor and vulnerable\nsegments in societies.</td>

      <td>2018). Across all scenarios, the amount of bioenergy and BECCS ranges from 0 EJ yr&#8211;1 to 561 EJ yr&#8211;1 in 2100 (Figure 1 in this box,\nleft panel). Notably, all 1.5&#176;C pathways include bioenergy, requiring as much as 7 Mkm2 to be dedicated to the production of energy\ncrops in 2050 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). If BECCS is excluded as a mitigation option, studies indicate that more biomass may be required\nin order to substitute for a greater proportion of fossil fuels (Muratori et al. 2016; Rose et al. 2014).</td>

      <td>Different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use alternative approaches to land allocation when determining where and how\nmuch biomass is used, with some relying on economic approaches and some relying on rule-based approaches (Popp et al. 2014).\nDespite these differences, a consistent finding across models is that increasing biomass supply to the extent necessary to support\ndeep decarbonisation is likely to involve substantial land-use change (Popp et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this chapter). In\nmodel runs, bioenergy deployment and the consequent demand for biomass and land, is influenced by assumptions around the price\nof bioenergy, the yield of bioenergy crops, the cost of production (including the costs of fertiliser and irrigation if used), the demand\nfor land for other uses, and the inclusion of policies (e.g., subsidies, taxes, constraints) that may alter land-use or bioenergy demand.\nIn general, higher carbon prices result in greater bioenergy deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 7, Figure 1, right panel) and a larger\npercentage of BECCS. Other factors can also strongly influence bioenergy use, including the cost and availability of fossil fuels (Calvin\net al. 2016a), socio-economics (Popp et al. 2017), and policy (Calvin et al. 2014; Reilly et al. 2012).</td>
