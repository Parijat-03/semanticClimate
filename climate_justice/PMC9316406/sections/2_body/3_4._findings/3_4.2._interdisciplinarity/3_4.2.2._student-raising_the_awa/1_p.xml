In fact, while working in an elementary school, the student partnered with teachers, administrative staff, and other support workers (e.g., psychologists and speech pathologists). The immense value of interdisciplinary work is that each profession can play to its strengths. Unlike the psychologist&#8217;s one-to-one consulting, school social workers support the students throughout their in-school and out-of-school time. This engagement with students strengthens the social workers&#8217; comprehension of the triangulation of emotional, psychological, and social well-being and their overlapping influence on student mental health and overall well-being [<xref rid="B71-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. GSW training broadens the student&#8217;s acknowledgment of the triangulation and interconnected influences in the context of extreme events. Accordingly, the student brought the unique social work perspective emphasizing crisis-specific social and emotional well-being into the partnership with the psychologist to improve their mental health service. This interdisciplinary collaboration effectively addressed students&#8217; unique needs in consideration of their holistic health. </p>
