<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Using the successes of medical simulation and standardized patients, 5
patient cases were developed as an integral part of the curriculum to both
illustrate the importance of climate change communication and to share
climate messaging strategies. Dr Katzman (the CCHH ECHO medical director)
collaborated very closely with the medical simulation lead at the University
of California, San Diego, John-Michael Maury (JMM). After Dr Katzman created
the 5 simulated patient cases, JMM worked with 5 different professional
actors to play the standardized patients. A mock session between one of the
hub team members (portraying the clinician) and the actor (portraying the
standardized patient) took place virtually the week prior to the live CCHH
ECHO session. During the CCHH ECHO, the standardized patient/actor connected
to the session as the ECHO patient in &#8220;full character.&#8221; The ECHO IT team
spotlighted both the standardized patient and the clinician to fully engage
the course participants.</p>
