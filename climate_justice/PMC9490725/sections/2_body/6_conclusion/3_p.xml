The question is not just why agreement cannot be reached on these mechanisms, but why they are the only mechanisms discussed, given their well-known shortcomings. The underlying issue is political, concerning the invisibility of alternative approaches which leads us to choose solutions that at best will make only a partial contribution. This mode of governance carries an implication of (particularly neoliberal) economics as a natural rather than social science, with predictive and explanatory models, but natural scientists are mocking this continued obsession with failed market-based mechanisms, as the quotation above from climate scientists Anderson and Bows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>) makes clear. An essential part of escaping the current impasse is recognising the ethical dimension as proposed by Felli and Sandel. If we continue to view atmospheric pollution leading to climate change as only an economic issue and a matter of designing the right incentive, we will fail.</p>
