<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Another observation we found in readers&#8217; comments is their utilization of the
model to mentally simulate future events about the possible trends of COVID.
This, however, could yield a worrying perspective and negative sentiment about
the future as one commenter puts it &#8220;There is no way to eradicate this virus and
other viruses. Everybody will be afraid to engage in sports, travel and even
work. Life as we know has been dramatically diminished forever.&#8221; Even in the
presence of optimistic news such as the vaccine development, readers expressed
their negative outlook of the future outcome of COVID based on their
interpretation of the models &#8220;I think a vaccine is at least a year away and that
is super optimistic. By then, Covid might well have run its course, killing
millions.&#8221; Other commenters used information from the models to compare it to
the present state of the virus at the time. This mental process could have
created negative emotions and perception of the uncertain future as readers
interpreted results of the model. For example, a commenter in their seventies
shared: &#8220;all outcomes are uncertain and trend towards the dire, towards the non
flattened curve on your chart [referring to the model]. My husband and I are
both in our seventies. We&#8217;re not panicking, but are definitely afraid.&#8221;</p>
