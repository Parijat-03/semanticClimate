In 2019, Samudu Atapattu and Andrea Schapper reviewed arguments that future generations also have rights, such as the right to clean drinking water, the right to health, and the right to adequate food. They argue that our actions today should not compromise the ability of future generations to enjoy these rights.<sup><xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Atapattu has explored these issues from the perspective of the Convention on the Rights of the Child within a framework of sustainable development and intergenerational equity, noting that some environmental treaties also embody the intergenerational principle.<sup><xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> In 2020, Lydia Slobodian reviewed court cases brought on behalf of child plaintiffs and future generations in the United States.<sup><xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> These arguments are gaining traction in diverse jurisdictions. In 2021, a German court upheld a complaint brought by children and others that the government&#8217;s climate change targets and annual emissions allowed until 2030 were incompatible with complainants&#8217; fundamental rights, including their rights to health and to life.<sup><xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> Also in 2021, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, responding to a complaint by 16 child complainants, found that a state party can be held responsible for the negative impact of carbon emissions originating within its territory, whatever the location of the harm, including outside its territory.<sup><xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup></p>
