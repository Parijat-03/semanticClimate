<bold>E<sc>Vans</sc>:</bold> The Web site <italic>A People's Archive of Police Violence in Cleveland</italic> has an archivist on their advisory board to assist. Every couple of years the archivist goes back to the board to see if they're okay, and if they're not, there's a contingency plan. Part of these community partnerships is validating that they should exist, that these communities should exist, that these communities should maintain some things that we're not here to take. We're here to help.</p>
