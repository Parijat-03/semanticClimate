in the news media, this research elaborates three main types of public responses
(affective, action-oriented, and evaluative as well as several subthemes of those
types) that we observed in the online news comments to articles of predictive
journalism related to the COVID pandemic. This richly described typology of
responses offers a contribution insofar as it nuances the ways through which
predictive information is processed and could indeed impact cognition or behavior,
suggesting routes through which the misinterpretation of predictions in news media

2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al.,
2020</xref>) could be activated. Moreover, the typology offers fertile ground
for researchers to further explore and validate these types of audience responses,
operationalize them for potential quantitative or computational analysis at a larger
scale, and expand and validate them in other contexts such as in political,
economic, or climate forecasts. Studying the range of public response to predictive
journalism is a necessary first step toward understanding how journalistic practice
might also adapt to avoid misinforming the public, biasing its opinion, or
discourage it from civic participation. In the following subsections, we further
discuss implications for research and practice that emerge from our synthesis of the
response types.</p>
