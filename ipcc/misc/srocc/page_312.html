The Quarantine Department focuses only on pests and pathogens but takes no notice of plant and animal species being imported. Also, there is no provision for checking the possible impacts of imported species on the environment (Rashid et al. 2014) or for carrying out bioassays of active allelopathic compounds of alien plants.</span></div><div left="59.24" right="268.28" top="627.42"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 64.44; y0: 627.42; y1: 637.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.24" y0="627.42" x1="268.28">1.7.4 Oases in hyper-arid areas in the Arabian Peninsula and northern Africa</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.29" top="591.52"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 65.06; y0: 591.52; y1: 601.02; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="591.52" x1="307.29">Oases are isolated areas with reliable water supply from lakes and springs, located in hyper-arid and arid zones (Figure&#160;3.15). Oasis agriculture has long been the only viable crop production system throughout the hot and arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Oases in hyper-arid climates are usually subject to water shortage as evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall. This often causes salinisation of soils. While many oases have persisted for several thousand years, many others have been abandoned, often in response to changes in climate or hydrologic conditions (Jones et al. 2019), providing testimony to societies&#8217; vulnerability to climatic shifts and raising concerns about similarly severe effects of anthropogenic climate change (Jones et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.3" top="435.54"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 65.06; y0: 435.54; y1: 445.04; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="435.54" x1="307.3">On the Arabian Peninsula and in North Africa, climate change is projected to have substantial and complex effects on oasis areas (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011; Ashkenazy et al. 2012; Bachelet et al. </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.81" top="735.54"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.33; y0: 735.54; y1: 745.04; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.54" x1="565.81">2016; Guan et al. 2018; Iknayan and Beissinger 2018; Ling et al. 2013). To illustrate, by the 2050s, the oases in southern Tunisia are expected to be affected by hydrological and thermal changes, with an average temperature increase of&#160;2.7&#176;C, a&#160;29% decrease in precipitation and a&#160;14% increase in evapotranspiration rate (Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Tunisia and GIZ 2007). In Morocco, declining aquifer recharge is expected to impact the water supply of the Figuig oasis (Jilali 2014), as well as for the Draa Valley (Karmaoui et al. 2016). Saudi Arabia is expected to experience a&#160;1.8&#176;C&#8211;4.1&#176;C increase in temperatures by 2050, which is forecast to raise agricultural water demand by&#160;5&#8211;15% in order to maintain production levels equal to those of 2011 (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani 2013). The increase of temperatures and variable pattern of rainfall over the central, north and south-western regions of Saudi Arabia may pose challenges for sustainable water resource management (Tarawneh and Chowdhury 2018). Moreover, future climate scenarios are expected to increase the frequency of &#64258; oods and &#64258; ash &#64258; oods, such as in the coastal areas along the central parts of the Red Sea and the south-southwestern areas of Saudi Arabia (Almazroui et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.84" top="495.57"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 325.33; y0: 495.57; y1: 505.07; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="495.57" x1="565.84">While many oases are cultivated with very heat-tolerant crops such as date palms, even such crops eventually have declines in their productivity when temperatures exceed certain thresholds or hot conditions prevail for extended periods. Projections so far do not indicate severe losses in land suitability for date palm for the Arabian Peninsula (Aldababseh et al. 2018; Shabani et al. 2015). It is unclear, however, how reliable the climate response parameters in the underlying models are, and actual responses may differ substantially. </span></div><div left="324.28" right="71.32" top="260.73"><span style="x0: 324.28; x1: 328.58; y0: 260.73; y1: 268.73; width: 4.3; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="324.28" y0="260.73" x1="71.32">ba</span></div><div left="67.92" right="329.13" top="109.93"><span style="x0: 67.92; x1: 71.33; y0: 109.93; y1: 117.93; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="67.92" y0="109.93" x1="329.13">cd</span></div><div left="59.53" right="285.99" top="85.81"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.23; y0: 85.81; y1: 93.81; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="85.81" x1="285.99">Figure&#160;3.15 |  Oases across the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa </span><span style="x0: 286.34; x1: 288.42; y0: 85.75; y1: 93.75; width: 2.07; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="286.34" y0="85.75" x1="366.54">(alphabetically by country). </span><span style="x0: 366.88; x1: 369.25; y0: 85.81; y1: 93.81; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="366.88" y0="85.81" x1="377.53">(a) </span><span style="x0: 377.87; x1: 383.79; y0: 85.75; y1: 93.75; width: 5.92; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="377.87" y0="85.75" x1="565.65">Masayrat ar Ruwajah oasis, Ad Dakhiliyah (cid:1)Governorate, Oman (Photo: Eike L&#252;deling). </span><span style="x0: 126.9; x1: 129.27; y0: 76.31; y1: 84.31; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="126.9" y0="76.31" x1="137.85">(b) </span><span style="x0: 137.69; x1: 141.1; y0: 76.25; y1: 84.25; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="137.69" y0="76.25" x1="366.81">Tasselmanet oasis, Ouarzazate Province, Morocco (Photo: Abdellatif Khattabi). </span><span style="x0: 367.1; x1: 369.47; y0: 76.31; y1: 84.31; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="367.1" y0="76.31" x1="377.17">(c) </span><span style="x0: 377.01; x1: 381.46; y0: 76.25; y1: 84.25; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="377.01" y0="76.25" x1="565.69">Al-Ahsa oasis, Al-Ahsa Governarate, Saudi Arabia (Photo: Shijan Kaakkara). </span><span style="x0: 92.44; x1: 94.81; y0: 66.82; y1: 74.82; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="92.44" y0="66.82" x1="103.39">(d) </span><span style="x0: 103.59; x1: 107.14; y0: 66.75; y1: 74.75; width: 3.55; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="103.59" y0="66.75" x1="565.66">Zarat oasis, Governorate of Gabes, Tunisia (Photo: Hamda Aloui).
