They also decrease the hydrological connectivity and thus reduce hillside runoff (Preti et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2016; Arn&#225;ez et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017).

At least since the 1980s, agroforestry has been widely touted as an ideal land management practice in areas vulnerable to climate variations and subject to soil erosion. Agroforestry holds the promise of improving soil and climatic conditions, while generating income from wood energy, timber and non-timber products&#160;&#8211; sometimes presented as a&#160;synergy of adaptation and mitigation of climate change (Mbow et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.52" top="399.54"><span style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.65; y0: 399.54; y1: 409.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.43" y0="399.54" x1="571.52">There is strong scienti&#64257;c consensus that a&#160;combination of forestry with agricultural crops and/or livestock, agroforestry systems can provide additional ecosystem services when compared with monoculture crop systems (Waldron et al. 2017; Sonwa et al. 2011, 2014, 2017; Charles et al. 2013). Agroforestry can enable sustainable intensi&#64257;cation by allowing continuous production on the same unit of land with higher productivity without the need to use shifting agriculture systems to maintain crop yields (Nath et al. 2016). This is especially relevant where there is a&#160;regional requirement to &#64257;nd a&#160;balance between the demand for increased agricultural production and the protection of adjacent natural ecosystems such as primary and secondary forests (Mbow et al. 2014). For example, the use of agroforestry for perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa is increasingly promoted as offering a&#160;route to sustainable farming, with important climate change adaptation and mitigation co-bene&#64257;ts (Sonwa et al. 2001; Kroeger et al. 2017). Reported co-bene&#64257;ts of agroforestry in cocoa production include increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, improved water and nutrient use ef&#64257;ciency and the creation of a&#160;favourable micro-climate for crop production (Sonwa et al. 2017; Chia et al. 2016). Importantly, the maintenance of soil fertility using agroforestry has the potential to reduce the practice of shifting agriculture (of cocoa) which results in deforestation (Gockowski and Sonwa 2011). However, positive interactions within these systems can be ecosystem and/or species speci&#64257;c, but co-bene&#64257;ts such as increased resilience to extreme climate events, or improved soil fertility are not always observed (Blaser et al. 2017; Abdulai et al. 2018). These contrasting outcomes indicate the importance of &#64257;eld-scale research programmes to inform agroforestry system design, species selection and management practices (Sonwa et al. 2014).&#160;</span></div></body></html>
