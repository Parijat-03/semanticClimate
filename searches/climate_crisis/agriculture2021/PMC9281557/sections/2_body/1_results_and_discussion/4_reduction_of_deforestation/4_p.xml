<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0160">Forests play an essential role in reducing global warming by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and absorbing air pollutants. In Iran, due to the outbreak of the disease and the limited cessation of tourism activities, forests have been preserved to some extent, and other incidents such as fires have not occurred. Forest fires are significant sources of pollution, so reducing fires may improve air quality in the southeastern part of the United States. Fewer fires may have occurred due to economic constraints on the use of forests and the requirements for social distancing in March 2020.<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref>
