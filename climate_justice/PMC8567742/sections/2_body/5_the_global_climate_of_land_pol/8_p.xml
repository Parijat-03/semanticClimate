<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This strategic shift towards neoliberal global land politics has been facilitated by a hegemonic narrative with two interlinked aspects: the purported political <italic toggle="yes">impossibility and undesirability</italic> of state-driven, system-wide, class-based redistributive land policies, on the one hand, and the practical political feasibility and desirability of market-based, privatized, so-called demand-driven and &#8216;multistakeholder&#8217; approaches, on the other hand (Herring, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). This narrative has led to a recasting of the unit of analysis and public action: from transforming inequitable land-based social relations into more egalitarian relations based on social justice, to formalizing institutions of private property to invigorate land markets. Some critical questions are provoked by this conservative shift: can the capitalist market relations that caused landlessness self-correct towards egalitarian land-based social relations? Will the institutions and actors that deployed extra-economic coercion that caused widespread expulsions from the land turn back and self-correct via self-imposed reparation? Not impossible but unlikely in the current conjuncture. The &#8216;land tenure security&#8217; strategy seems to suggest that we just forget, forgive and formalize land dispossession caused by extra-economic coercion. In short, and to put it in polemical terms, the implication of the above is to shift public action from dismantling land-based inequality to formalizing inequality.</p>
