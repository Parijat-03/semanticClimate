<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Micro-level: Although the nature of social work discipline is interdisciplinary, practical modules to guide the interdisciplinary work at the primary micro-level practice level are still developing [<xref rid="B69-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This professional deficit limits the social workers in applying interdisciplinary approaches to understand diverse factors associated with clients&#8217; health and overall well-being. The full spectrum of disaster-specific influences on residents&#8217; health and well-being propels social workers to work in multidisciplinary teams and develop interdisciplinary interventions. Accordingly, enhancing the students&#8217; understanding of this range of impacts initiates the first step in building a collaborative foundation. Contextualizing influences on individuals and families within disaster surroundings improves the feasibility for students to embrace the root causes of these influences associated with different societal dimensions, including economic, social, cultural, and political. The interconnections among these dimensions trigger compounded impacts on individuals&#8217; and families&#8217; health and well-being, encouraging social workers to collaborate with other professionals to develop holistic interventions. </p>
