<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par17">Methodologically, our approach resonates with social-ecological systems (SES) models. These models include socio-political norms and rules as inter-related variables and they can serve as a diagnostic tool for studying sustainability problems (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). A fundamental feature of such models is their interpretation of the complex systems property of near-decomposability (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). Near-decomposability means that a system is composed of several subsystems and their dynamic interactions. Furthermore, a system is said to be near-decomposable, if its subsystems are interacting but to a considerable degree autonomously functioning entities (Holland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>, pp. 15&#8211;18; Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>, 109&#8211;111; Simon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1962</xref>). Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the quasi near-decomposable architecture of our model.</p>
