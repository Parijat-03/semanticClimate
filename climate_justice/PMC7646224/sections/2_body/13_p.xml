Treating climate as a siloed issue is not only inaccurate analysis but also it leads to politically dangerous solutions, such as the &#8216;carbon fundamentalist approach&#8217;, which emphasizes market-based solutions for reducing carbon emissions at the expense of working-class people. Such an approach can have disastrous political and socioeconomic implications, as we&#8217;ve seen in Australia and France, where each government has pushed carbon taxes and faced significant public backlash.</p>
