Spread through human encroachment on wilderness habitats, tracing circuits of accelerated multinational exchange, and&#160;arriving amid growing alarm about the climate emergency, COVID 19 serves as a stark reminder that deregulated growth and consumerism are chewing through and polluting ecological systems at an alarming rate, threatening the web of life (Bellamy Foster and Suwandi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2021</xref>; Wallace et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>; Hickel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). As we race towards a sixth mass extinction (Barnosky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>), a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that a rise of 1.5&#160;&#176;C is &#8220;dicing with the planet&#8217;s livability&#8221; and calls for immediate decarbonization (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>), and 230 medical journals describe global warming as the &#8220;greatest threat to global public health&#8221; (Atwoli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). The third IPCC report concludes that meeting climate targets requires a paradigmatic shift away from the growth-oriented capitalist model (Bordera Rom&#225; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). Warming disproportionately harms poor and farming communities in the Global South already reeling from decades of free market policies and who are the least responsible for rising temperatures (World People&#8217;s Congress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2010</xref>).</p>
