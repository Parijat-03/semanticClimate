It tends to an equalization of the future per capita emissions taking into account the future population projections and applies a correction considering historical responsibility. The model allocates more emissions to countries that were historically below the world average per capita emissions and penalizes those who were above. For further insights on the mathematical details of the MCJ, the authors recommend the reading of Annex I contained in the supplementary electronic material of Alcaraz et al.&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>) paper.</p>
