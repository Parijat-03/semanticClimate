The implication is that developing an agriculturally-smart village entails accepting the concept of climate-smart agriculture. Agricultural risk posed by climate is a threat to food security. As a result, there is an urgent need to effectively manage agricultural production, while fighting climate change through adaptation, resilience and mitigation [<xref rid="B69-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This is what climate-smart agriculture offers.</p>
