<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The total emissions [water use, <em>land use</em>] generated [used] in the production of goods and services regardless of the location and timing of those emissions [water use, land use] in the production process. This includes emissions [water use, land use] within the country used to produce goods or services for the countryâs own use, but also includes the emissions [water use, land use] related to the production of such goods or services in other countries that are then consumed in another country through imports. Such emissions [water, land] are termed âembodiedâ or âembeddedâ emissions, or in some cases, (particularly with water) as âvirtual water useâ (Davis and Caldeira, 2010; Allan, 2005; MacDonald et al., 2015).</p></dd>
