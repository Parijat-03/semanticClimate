It is important to recognise the different roles played by a state in maritime policy, according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In any given situation, a state may be acting as a flag state (the country where the ship is registered), a port state (when exercising rights to inspect vessels calling at their ports) or a coastal state (when exercising jurisdiction over vessels sailing within their territorial waters). The EU is also an important actor in maritime policy, and has periodically influenced the IMO by its actions, implementing regulations on double hulls to prevent oil spills, Port State Control for ship inspection and sulphur emission regulations before the IMO. Such regulations only applied within the EU but they acted as policy feedback to increase pressure on the IMO to apply similar policies globally.</p>
