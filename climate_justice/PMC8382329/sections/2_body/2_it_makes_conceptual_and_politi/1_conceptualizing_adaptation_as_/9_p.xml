The argument is that inflicting harm on a person or a country without due diligence is a culpable action, and hence liable for paying compensation (Verheyen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2005</xref>; Farber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>). Such payment actually is the application of the Polluter Pays Principle ex post. Though Decision 1/CP.21 (para 51) forecloses the claims of liability under L&amp;D, it is not contained in Article 8 of the PA. Also, it does not stop CSOs or citizens from suing the polluters, as is happening worldwide, in the EU and the USA.</p>
