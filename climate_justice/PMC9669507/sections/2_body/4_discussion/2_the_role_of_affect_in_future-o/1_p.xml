appears to have an effect on peoples&#8217; mental well-being (<xref rid="bibr35-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Satici et al., 2022</xref>). The
<italic toggle="yes">affective response</italic> theme surfaced some of the negative
emotions attributed to the pandemic that are in line with recent research (<xref rid="bibr8-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Coelho et al., 2020</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr25-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al.,
2020</xref>). Although our findings in this theme reflect readers&#8217; fear and
anxiety about the future, we suggest that researchers should explore whether
predictive journalism could also have the capacity of eliciting prosocial
emotions, such as empathy, that could motivate cooperation in collective acts,
especially during crises (e.g. motivating the public to wear a mask during the
COVID pandemic as a precautionary measure to protect the elderly). In contrast,
misinterpreting predictive journalism articles could elicit negative emotions,
such as anger, that may divide the public and mobilize it toward hostile
action.</p>
