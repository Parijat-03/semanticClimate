Over the region, the projected temperature increase, including a&#160;higher probability of severe heatwaves (Russo et&#160;al., 2015), is accompanied by a&#160;reduction in precipitation (Jacob et&#160;al., 2014; Dosio, 2016; Rajczak and Sch&#228;r, 2017), resulting in projected increases of drought frequency and severity (Spinoni et&#160;al., 2018, 2020; Raymond et&#160;al., 2019). Also, the frequency and severity of marine heatwaves of the Mediterranean Sea are projected to increase (Darmaraki et&#160;al., 2019; see Section&#160;12.4 and Atlas.8.4).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.7" top="594.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="594.6" x1="304.7" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.51; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Only a&#160;limited number of RCM simulations for the MENA domain are currently available. For the southern and eastern Mediterranean, they project a&#160;mean warming ranging from 3&#176;C for RCP4.5 to 9&#176;C for RCP8.5 at the end of this century compared to its beginning (Bucchignani et&#160;al., 2018; Ozturk et&#160;al., 2018). The frequency and duration of heatwaves and annual number of extremely hot days (i.e., those with maximum temperature &gt;50&#176;C) in the southern Mediterranean will increase substantially. For 2070&#8211;2099 with respect to 1971&#8211;2000 the latter might even reach 70 days for RCP8.5 (Lelieveld et&#160;al., 2016; Almazroui, 2019; Driouech et&#160;al., 2020; Varela&#160;et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="450.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="450.6" x1="304.77" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 450.6; y1: 460.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Despite the large efforts of these regional downscaling projects, the global model&#8211;RCM matrix is still sparse and lacking a&#160;systematic design to explore the uncertainty sources (e.g.,&#160;global model, RCM, scenario, resolution) (Section&#160;10.3). Focusing on the Iberian peninsula, Fern&#225;ndez et&#160;al. (2019) argued that the driving global model is the main contributor to uncertainty in the ensemble. Physically consistent but implausible temperature changes in RCMs can occur. An example is a&#160;strong temperature increase over the Pyrenees due to excessive snow cover in the present climate (Fern&#225;ndez et&#160;al., 2019). Based on an older set of RCM simulations (ENSEMBLES), D&#233;qu&#233; et&#160;al. (2012) also argued that the largest source of uncertainty in the temperature response over southern Europe is the choice of the driving global model (whereas for summer precipitation the choice of the RCM dominates the uncertainty). Finally, Bo&#233; et&#160;al. (2020a) found that over a&#160;large area of Europe, including parts of the Mediterranean, RCMs project a&#160;summer warming 1.5&#176;C&#8211;2&#176;C colder than in their driving global models for the end of the 21st&#160;century. This is caused by differences in solar radiation related to the absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in RCMs (Bo&#233; et&#160;al., 2020a; Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2020), which also affects the noted differences in cloud cover between global models and RCMs (Bart&#243;k et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="174.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="174.6" x1="304.73" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Statistical downscaling studies for the Mediterranean confirm the results from global model and RCM studies, with large agreement among future projections showing lower rates of warming in winter and spring, and, in most cases, higher ones in summer and autumn (Jacobeit et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="175.8" top="102.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="102.48" x1="175.8" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 102.48; y1: 112.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.4.8 Storyline Approaches</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="78.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="78.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The atmospheric circulation is influenced by large-scale, often slowly varying components of the climate system, such as ocean, sea ice and soil moisture.

Zappa and Shepherd (2017) have analysed this for the Mediterranean region and developed a&#160;set of storylines based on different plausible evolutions of those drivers and their impact on the Mediterranean winter climate. Important identified drivers during winter are tropical and polar amplification of global warming and the polar stratospheric vortex (Manzini et&#160;al., 2014; Simpson et&#160;al., 2018), with implications for precipitation. Zappa (2019) discusses the relative amplitude of&#160;tropical and Arctic warming, response of the AMOC, patterns of Pacific SST change, and changes in stratospheric vortex strength as possible drivers of the Mediterranean summer climate and stresses that given the present state of knowledge, alternative storylines based on these drivers should be considered as equally plausible future manifestations of regional climate change. Brogli et&#160;al. (2019a, b) and Kr&#246;ner et&#160;al. (2017) have revealed thermodynamic processes, lapse rate, and circulation as important drivers for Mediterranean summer climate.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="498.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="498.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.08; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Low-likelihood high-impact events might affect future Mediterranean climate. An example of such an event is the collapse of the AMOC (Weijer et&#160;al., 2019), that would bring widespread cooling over the Northern Hemisphere. For the Mediterranean this is estimated to be a&#160;few degrees Celsius during summer in the case of a&#160;total collapse (Jackson et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="487.37" top="414.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="414.48" x1="487.37" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.4.9 Climate Information Distilled From Multiple&#160;Lines&#160;of&#160;Evidence</span></div><div left="315.21" right="345.02" top="378.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="378.6" x1="345.02" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 344.96; x1: 349.01; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="344.96" y0="378.6" x1="421.33">very high confidence </span><span x0="421.27" y0="378.6" x1="423.91" style="x0: 421.27; x1: 423.91; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(</span><span style="x0: 423.91; x1: 428.49; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="423.91" y0="378.6" x1="480.64">high agreement</span><span x0="480.64" y0="378.6" x1="484.85" style="x0: 480.64; x1: 482.92; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">, </span><span style="x0: 484.79; x1: 487.6; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="484.79" y0="378.6" x1="541.52">robust evidence</span><span x0="541.52" y0="378.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 541.52; x1: 544.16; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) that the Mediterranean region has experienced a&#160;summer temperature increase in recent decades that is faster than the increase for the Northern Hemisphere summer mean.

For example, the potential effects of climate change on public health are discussed in several national climate change and adaptation reports (Bruci et&#160;al., 2016; MoARE, 2016; MoE, 2016; MoEP, 2018; MoEU, 2018). Although these reports are extremely helpful and widely used for the development of national adaptation policies, they are often based on non-comprehensive and heterogeneous sources of climate information (e.g.,&#160;MEEN, 2018; MoE/UNDP/GEF, 2019). For instance, future climate change projections are based on a&#160;limited number of socio-economic scenarios and climate model simulations, which are also often not evaluated comprehensively (e.g.,&#160;Bruci et&#160;al., 2016; MoARE, 2016; MoEU, 2018). In addition, these reports are often not peer-reviewed, not available in English, and mainly limited to the country level, thus making it difficult to compare the details of the climate information across them.</span></div></body></html>
