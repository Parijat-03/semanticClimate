<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Before the interviews, we shared the information that we had collected online using the data collection framework (Table <xref rid="tmi13714-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with the key informants. The first step of the interviews was to check that what we had collected from the online sources was correct and complete.&#160;If the key informant provided additional information that was not publicly available, we noted it separately in the data collection. We also asked each key informant their opinion regarding factors that were facilitating progress and factors that were acting as barriers to progress. The interviews were the main source of information on success factors and challenges. We present the aggregated results.</p>
