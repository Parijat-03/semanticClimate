<sup>2</sup>) of 0.19 as the best model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of the median minimum dwell time at parks for each county in the study area. For the effects of COVID&#8208;19 outbreaks, we found people spent less time in the counties with more positive cases, except Arizona and Utah in June&#8211;July and Washington and eastern Montana/Wyoming in August&#8211;September (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For the effects of monthly average of minimum smoke, we found the number of counties with positive correlations on the median of minimum dwell time increased from June&#8211;September (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). For the effects of wildfires, we found people spent more time at parks with higher wildfire density in most counties of the study area (e.g., in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and New Mexico) in June and July (Figure&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). However, people avoided the wildfires with the negative correlation between dwell time and wildfire density in most areas in August and September except some parts of California, Colorado, and New Mexico.</p>
