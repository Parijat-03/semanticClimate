For example, heat wave plans have surveillance systems able to predict future heat waves and are based on alerts that trigger actions to reduce the negative effects on health. Along the same lines, surveillance programs and control of vectors and reservoirs initially detect new vectors and reservoirs and can carry out rapid interventions to minimize the negative effects on the population. Another example includes urban planning measures such as setting up climate shelters to protect the most vulnerable persons during days or periods of extreme heat or increasing urban green space to reduce the heat island effect, especially in the most vulnerable neighbourhoods. It is important to monitor the resilience of social and health services in extreme climate situations to guarantee that they do not pose a risk to patients and that they can cope with events such as power cuts.</p>
