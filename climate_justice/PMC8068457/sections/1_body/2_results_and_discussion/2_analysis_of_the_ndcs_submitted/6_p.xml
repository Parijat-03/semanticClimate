In the figure, it can be observed that for some years now, countries from the EU27 have entered into a stage in which emissions per capita and GDP per capita are decoupled and that they are maintaining an economic growth that does not imply an increase of the emissions per capita. As seen in the lower-left section in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the cumulative emissions of these countries in the historical period have been higher than those from non-EU27 countries, and therefore, they have a smaller future emissions budget. Their capacity to undertake a very ambitious mitigation supported by a higher GDP per capita should enable them to increase their NDC ambition, which is currently not compatible with the 1.5&#160;&#176;C scenario.
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The Mediterranean countries belonging to the EU27 (left section) are compared with countries not belonging to the EU27 (right section). In the upper section, the graph shows the evolution of the emissions per capita from these countries in function with the GDP per capita. The lower section shows the cumulative emissions per capita from the historical period, in addition to, firstly, those allocated by the MCJ and, secondly, those that would be consumed according to the NDC as at 2030</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10584_2021_3070_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
