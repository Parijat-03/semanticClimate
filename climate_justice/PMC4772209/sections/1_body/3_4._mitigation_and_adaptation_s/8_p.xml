Hallegatte <italic>et al.</italic> contend that climate change policies are best implemented at the local scale by mitigating transportation, energy, water, and building infrastructures to reduce human impacts on greenhouse gas emission and by adapting locally to climate change effects [<xref rid="B112-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>].
