In the eyes of many people, COVID-19 appeared to be a sudden crisis came out from nowhere. However, disease ecologists have been warning, for a long time, of the growing risk of emerging infectious diseases&#8212;in particular, zoonotic viruses that spill over from non-human animals into humans (Daszak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>; Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). Anthropogenic land-use change (i.e. deforestation caused by agricultural land acquisition) has led to wildlife habitat loss, which has subsequently increased the risk of zoonoses spillover (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>; Gibb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). So, in the eyes of disease ecologists, even though how exactly the virus jumped from animals to humans is yet unknown, the emergence of novel coronavirus (originating from bats) was a predictable, imminent threat. Just like climate scientists have anticipated that climate change would become a grave threat to humanity.</p>
