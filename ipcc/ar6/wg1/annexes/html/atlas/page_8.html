This is a topic which is assessed from a methodological perspective in Chapter 10 using a limited 2 set of examples. The Atlas then builds on this work with a more comprehensive treatment of the available 3 results, including (but not exclusively) CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX, to provide wider coverage and to 4 further demonstrate techniques and issues. 5 6 Generating information relevant to policy or practice requires understanding the context of the systems that 7 they focus on. In addition to the hazards these systems face, their vulnerability and exposure, and the related 8 socio-economic and other physical drivers, also need to be understood. To ensure this relevance, the Atlas is 9 informed by the assessments in Chapter 12 and the regional and thematic chapters and cross-chapter papers 10 of WG II. It will thus focus on generating messages and information on climatic impact drivers and hazards 11 applicable to assessing risks on human and ecological systems whilst noting the potential relevance of these 12 to related contexts such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 13 Reduction. 14 15 Finally, developing and synthesising all of this information, whilst understanding the context in which it is or 16 could be usefully applied, draws on and further develops methods for communicating climate information. It 17 also provides a series of good practise examples on constructing clear and scientifically credible messages. 18 This is used to provide an assessment of communication methods, with accompanying guidelines on 19 generating relevant climate information and a final section describing the online Interactive Atlas and how to 20 interpret the information it displays. 21 22 23 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.63; y0: 481.79; y1: 492.77; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="481.79" x1="391.69">Atlas.2 Defining temporal, spatial and typological domains and scales </span><span x0="27.66" y0="481.79" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 481.79; y1: 492.77; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">24 25 Over the past decades scientists have engaged in a wide array of investigations aimed at quantifying and 26 understanding the state of the components of the land surface-ocean-atmosphere system, the complex nature 27 of their interactions and impacts over different temporal and spatial scales. Through these studies a great deal 28 has been learned about the importance of treating the appropriate temporal and spatial scale when estimating 29 changes due to internal climate variability, trends, characterization of the spatiotemporal variability and 30 quantifying the range of and establishing confidence in climate projections. It is therefore important to be 31 able to explore a whole range of spatial and temporal scales and the Atlas complements the other chapters by 32 facilitating this exploration of their assessments.  33 34 This section presents the basic definitions of the temporal and spatial scales and domains of analysis used by 35 the Atlas accounting for potential synergies between WGI and WGII. Noting the approach taken in the 36 recent IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial levels (SR1.5; 37 IPCC, 2018a), the Atlas will also present key global and regional climate changes at different global 38 warming levels. 39 40 In order to increase transparency and FAIR data practises, most of the results reported in this section can be 41 reproduced using the scripts and data provided in the Atlas GitHub repository (Atlas GitHub, 2020). 42 43 44 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 215.15; y1: 226.13; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="215.15" x1="424.66">Atlas.2.1 Baseline and future time-slice periods and temporal scales of analysis </span><span x0="27.66" y0="215.15" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 215.15; y1: 226.13; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">45 46 Chapter 1 has extensively explored this topic in Section 1.5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 1.2. A summary of the 47 main points relevant to the Atlas are provided here.  48 49 There is no standard baseline in the literature although the WMO recommends a 30-year baseline approach 50 and the current official climate normal period is 1981&#8211;2010. However, it retains the 1961&#8211;1990 period as the 51 historical baseline period for the sake of supporting long-term climate change assessments (WMO, 2017). 52 The application of the WMO standards also provides sample sizes relevant to calculating changes in 53 statistics other than the mean. The AR6 WGI has established the 1995&#8211;2014 period as modern reference 54 period &#8211; for similar reasons to the 1986&#8211;2005 period used in AR5 WGI (IPCC, 2013b) &#8211; since 2014 (2005) 55 </span></div></body></html>
