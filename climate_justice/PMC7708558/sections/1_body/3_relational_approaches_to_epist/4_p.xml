Ecopsychology is a branch of psychology that draws upon the ecological sciences to study the constitutive relations between minds and environments (Kanner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1995</xref>; Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). Studies on ecopsychology are typically concerned with the ecological unconscious, phenomenology, the interconnectedness of all beings, the transpersonal, and the transcendental (Kahn and Hasbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>).</p>
