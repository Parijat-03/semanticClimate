For historic responsibility (R1) quantitative results would differ, if based on the alternative consumption-based emission accounting, which allocates emissions of the full value chain to the country of final demand, irrespective of where the emissions physically have occurred during the production process. For the EU27 for all but four countries consumption-based emissions are higher&#8212;those four being Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Poland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Thus while a switch to consumption-based accounting would increase reduction commitments under R1 for the former countries, but decrease for the four latter ones, the classification of the three groups would not change.</p>
