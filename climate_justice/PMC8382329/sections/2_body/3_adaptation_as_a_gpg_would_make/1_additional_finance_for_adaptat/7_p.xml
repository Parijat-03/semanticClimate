The G20 pledge of eliminating fossil subsidies back in 2009 has still not yet been realized, even though the G7 2021 recommitted to do so. Almost half a trillion dollar of yearly subsidy to fossil fuels worldwide actually funds the climate problem, not the solution. The 2019 Climate Summit unequivocally demanded for carbon pricing and removal of fossil fuel subsidy, as the Secretary General himself very forcefully argued for taxing pollution, not people. Already about 57 carbon pricing programs at the local, national or international levels are being implemented across the world (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2019</xref>). However, the price range varies widely, with the highest being in Sweden with its price of $126/ton. By contrast, Poland and Ukraine have imposed prices just above zero, while the same source estimates the social cost of carbon is $52/ton. Even with half its price per ton, more than a trillion dollar could be mobilized a year beyond the public treasuries each year.</p>
