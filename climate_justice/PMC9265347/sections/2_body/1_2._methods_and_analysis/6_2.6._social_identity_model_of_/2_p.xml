This response, in turn, is a function of social identity-based predictors: the more strongly people identify with a relevant pro-environmental in-group, the more efficacious they feel, and the more salient respective pro-environmental values and norms within a group are, the higher the likelihood of performing pro-environmental behaviours. Specifically, the model proposes that the interaction of these variables affects both the appraisal of environmental crises that, in turn, can trigger (collective) emotions that affect individuals&#8217; efficacy beliefs, norms and whether and how people identify with certain groups, as well as responses.</p>
