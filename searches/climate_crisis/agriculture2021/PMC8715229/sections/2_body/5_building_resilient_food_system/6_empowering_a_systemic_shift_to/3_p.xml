<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0405">With regards to strengthening socioeconomic resilience, the pandemic has highlighted the need to extend comprehensive safety nets and introduce rapidly functioning social protection measures in our interconnected economies, exposed as they are to a variety of potential shocks and risks. Building on these lessons, governments and the international community should strengthen the scope and efficiency of social safety nets so that they reach the most vulnerable societal groups. Improved early warning capacities, understanding of the risk exposure and vulnerabilities of societal groups need to be coupled with facilitated access to social safety nets, simplified enrolment procedures, and reduced administrative burden for benefits claims.</p>
