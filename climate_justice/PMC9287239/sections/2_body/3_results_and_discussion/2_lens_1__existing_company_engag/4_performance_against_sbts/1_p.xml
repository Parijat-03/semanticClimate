Two studies recently used corporate disclosures to evaluate company-level progress against an assumed linear reduction trajectory to determine if companies were ahead or behind on their SBT(s) or had already achieved it prior to the target year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] found that companies were behind on 35% of the targets, ahead on 44%, and had already achieved the remaining 21%. An analysis by SBTi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] indicates<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> that companies were behind on 42% of the targets, ahead on 49%, and had already achieved 9%. The reason the SBTi analysis suggests a substantially lower share of targets already achieved is likely because its sample included all companies (297) with targets approved prior to November 2020, whereas Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] only included (81) companies reporting at least 2&#160;years of progress against their SBT as of February 2020. This sample difference may also explain why SBTi found a higher share of companies behind on their target(s), since more recent SBTs are typically aligned with a more ambitious temperature goal (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although SBTi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] covered more recent SBTs than Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], it should be noted that 20 companies are covered by the latter that are not covered by the former, according to our count, indicating that the two studies did not rely on the same corporate disclosure data<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref>. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] found that companies were significantly more likely to be ahead on their SBTs for scope 1 and 2 emissions than for scope 3 emissions. This is supported by the results of SBTi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref>, who also reported that its sample companies in combination reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% between 2015 and 2019, which exceeds the requirements of the absolute contraction approach for the 1.5&#160;&#176;C scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] suggest that the poorer performance on scope 3 may be due to the fact that companies have less control over emissions for which they are only indirectly responsible. Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] also noted that for most of the SBTs already achieved, companies had made substantial progress prior to the year the targets were approved by the SBTi (but after the base year). Similarly, the SBTi dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] shows that 6% of the SBTs that were approved in 2020 had already been achieved in that year, which was 5&#8211;10&#160;years earlier than targeted. These findings beg the question to what extent emission reductions of companies with SBTs can be attributed to setting SBTs versus companies&#8217; pre-existing course of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In addition, Bolton and Kacperczyk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]&#8217;s observation that companies tend to reduce emissions at a higher rate in the initial years after setting a reduction target than in later years indicates that initial progress according to a linear reduction trajectory may not be followed by long-term target achievement.</p>
