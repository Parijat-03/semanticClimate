<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Identity-based discrimination operates at group levels and thus contributes towards the development of group-based &#8220;horizontal&#8221; inequalities (Kabeer <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; see also Ribot <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The most enduring horizontal inequalities, Kabeer argues, are those associated with identities ascribed at birth such as race, gender, caste and ethnicity. She highlights how &#8220;personal&#8221; the articulation of social hierarchies can be. Cultural norms and practices can &#8220;disparage, stereotype, exclude, ridicule and demean certain social groups, denying them full personhood and equal rights to participate in the economic, social and political life of their society&#8221; (Kabeer <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, 13). Stuart (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) comments that the use of the term &#8220;group-based&#8221; is valuable yet paradoxical, as its real value is in allowing us to see the individual, rather than working with a concept of the poor, as aggregate poverty numbers. Understanding how different types of group-based marginalisation overlap, layering disadvantage upon disadvantage &#8211; for example, being poor, aged, a woman, a widow and a member of a discriminated-against ethnic minority &#8211; enables us to perceive almost viscerally what it means to be left behind and how difficult it can be to escape that situation (Mittal, Pereram, and Korkeala <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
