Indigenous knowledge systems and resource management practices are important tools for both mitigating and adapting to climate change (Fernandez-Llamazares et&#160;al., 2015). Indigenous knowledge is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time (Ahmed et&#160;al., 2016a). Knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems to the impacts of climate change and environmental hazards (Mall et&#160;al., 2019). The adaptation dimension involves developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts (Aghaei et&#160;al., 2018). It is also important to ensure inclusive efforts in DRR across different nations and communities as well as increasing skills and capacities of women towards DRR efforts (Alam and Rahman, 2014; Drolet et&#160;al., 2015; Islam et&#160;al., 2016b; Reyes and Lu, 2016; Hemachandra et&#160;al., 2018). More effective and efficient teaching and learning strategies, as well as collaborative networks, are needed to increase preparedness and DRR activities across various levels of community (Oktari et&#160;al., 2015; Takahashi et&#160;al., 2015; Tuladhar et&#160;al., 2015b; Shiwaku et&#160;al., 2016; Gampell et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.09" top="438.64"><span x0="42.52" y0="438.64" x1="296.09" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 438.64; y1: 448.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Table&#160;10.6 shows education and capacity-building aspects affecting adaptation by sub-region examples.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="144.96" top="402.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="402.48" x1="144.96" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.7.3 Knowledge gaps</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="378.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="378.6" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.62; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Capacity building at national and local levels still needs to address gaps in research and practice, such as impacts and results of different preparedness measures (Alcayna et&#160;al., 2016). Ad-hoc and localised documentations and monitoring of efforts to build adaptive capacities has rendered it difficult to assess success (Cinner et&#160;al., 2018). Recommendations for strengthened capacity building are sometimes made or understood in isolation from the underlying structural issues shaping vulnerability, or without adequately recognising the political relationships that mediate the ways in which particular technical interventions result in differentiated outcomes for different groups (Archer and Dodman, 2015). Thus, design- and decision-based tools, such as rapid assessment for community resilience to climate change as well as rapid approach to monitor the effectiveness of aid projects, support the community-based adaptation to climate change to analyse using a multi-dimensional approach, procedural, distributional, rights and responsibilities (Nkoana et&#160;al., 2018; Jacobson et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.08" top="174.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="174.63" x1="296.08" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 174.63; y1: 184.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As a model of communication and engagement, citizen science has the potential to promote individual and collective climate-change action (Groulx et&#160;al., 2017). More than information provision is needed to mobilise public action on climate change (Kyburz-Graber, 2013). Citizen science links communication and engagement in a manner that holds important lessons on ways to promote collective responses to climate (Wals et&#160;al., 2014; Bonney et&#160;al., 2016). The power of science-based citizen engagement lies in citizen group contribution in drawing upon their local knowledge to enrich the knowledge base required for management decisions (Sayer et&#160;al., 2015). Scientific evidence may be less attuned to the complexity of local realities in managing climate </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.11" top="714.64"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.64" x1="560.11" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.14; y0: 714.64; y1: 724.14; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">has many advantages for climate mitigation and adaptation practice and policy (Ford et&#160;al., 2016). While citizen science uses citizens as policy-passive objects for research in conducting measurements for big datasets, citizen social science is gaining momentum where it repositions citizens as central co-learners who can widen the climate-science evidence base to achieve a more holistic understanding for the benefit of all (Kythreotis et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="551.93" top="605.98"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.81; y0: 605.98; y1: 617.98; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="306.57" y0="605.98" x1="551.93">10.6 Climate Resilient Development Pathways</span></div><div left="306.57" right="547.88" top="582.48"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.77; y0: 582.48; y1: 592.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="306.57" y0="582.48" x1="547.88">10.6.1 Climate Resilient Development Pathways in Asia</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.13" top="558.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="558.6" x1="560.13" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.67; y0: 558.6; y1: 568.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) are &#8216;trajectories that strengthen sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar adaptation to and resilience in a changing climate&#8217; (Roy et&#160;al., 2018). Moving beyond a business-as-usual scenario, CRDPs involve not only adaptation and mitigation choices but also sustainable development implications and societal transformation (Roy et&#160;al., 2018). This basic understanding of CRDPs explicitly reflects that climate action (mitigation and adaptation) and sustainable development are fundamentally integrated and interdependent.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="337.87" top="426.62"><span x0="306.57" y0="426.62" x1="337.87" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 426.62; y1: 436.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 339.3; x1: 343.88; y0: 426.62; y1: 436.12; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="339.3" y0="426.62" x1="400.01">high confidence </span><span x0="401.45" y0="426.62" x1="560.16" style="x0: 401.45; x1: 404.26; y0: 426.62; y1: 436.12; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that currently implemented climate action in Asia (such as climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem-based DRR and investing in urban blue&#8211;green infrastructure) can meet adaptation, mitigation and SDGs simultaneously, presenting opportunities for climate resilient development (CRD).

However, in the 2020 Sustainability Index and Dashboard, only two Asian countries made it into the top 30&#160;countries in the world: Japan (17) and the Republic of Korea (20) (Sachs et&#160;al., 2020).
