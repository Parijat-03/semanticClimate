Its abundance and durability, which have made it a wonderfully cheap and reliable construction material for humans, have also endowed it with a lasting presence in ecosystems all around the world; some plastic has already occupied natural environments for decades beyond its original, typically fleeting, use (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_041" ref-type="bibr">Lebreton et&#160;al. 2018</xref>). The long-term environmental impacts of plastic are claimed to be, at best, &#8220;unknown&#8221; and &#8220;irreversible&#8221; <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_098" ref-type="bibr">(Hohn et al. 2020)</xref>, while other predictions are much more sobering: that plastic fragmentation is the beginning of a delayed, cumulative release of toxic chemicals, a &#8220;global plastic toxicity debt&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_070" ref-type="bibr">Rillig et&#160;al. 2021</xref>); and that plastic is &#8220;poised to dominate the 21st century as one of the yet-unchecked drivers of climate change&#8221; (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">Altman 2022</xref>).</p>
