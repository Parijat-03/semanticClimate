This conclusion is summarised in Figure A3. It shows that the establishment of the Union Federation and the channelling of technical training to women was the precondition for women, Santal and low-income Muslim, to effectively express their agency. This in turn has led to the ability of Santal and low-income Muslim women to secure a range of achievements. In turn, this is starting to shift the balance of power towards women who have been left behind.</p>
