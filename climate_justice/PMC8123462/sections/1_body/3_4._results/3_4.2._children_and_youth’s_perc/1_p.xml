For instance, a national survey from the Australian Childhood Foundation has considered indicators such as feeling troubled by the state of the world and thoughts around the seriousness of climate change and its impacts [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Other studies have acknowledged climate change effects in respect to a sense of climate related stress or worry, or a loss of security for the future [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, there is evidence that youth do not experience the same level of concern about climate change as children, and some studies have found that although youth associate health problems with climate change, they see the issue as a future problem that does not impact their lives now [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These perceptions can come from lived experiences as well as narratives projected by the media, education, family as well as from personal connections with nature [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
