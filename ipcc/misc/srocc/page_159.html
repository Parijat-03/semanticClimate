Also affected are many aspects of land functioning and type including agricultural productivity (Lesk et&#160;al. 2016), hydrology (Mosley 2015; Van Loon and Laaha 2015), vegetation productivity and distribution (Xu et&#160;al. 2011; Zhou et&#160;al. 2014), carbon &#64258;uxes and stocks, and other biogeochemical cycles (Frank et&#160;al. 2015b; Doughty et&#160;al. 2015; Schlesinger et&#160;al. 2016). Carbon stocks are particularly vulnerable to extreme events due to their large carbon pools and &#64258;uxes, potentially large lagged impacts and long recovery times to regain lost stocks (Frank et&#160;al. 2015a) (Section 2.2).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="224.1" top="519.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 519.42; y1: 529.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="519.42" x1="224.1">2.2.5.3  Changes in heavy precipitation</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="495.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 495.52; y1: 505.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="495.52" x1="313.24">A large number of extreme rainfall events have been documented over the past decades (Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012; Seneviratne et&#160;al. 2012; Trenberth 2012; Westra et&#160;al. 2013; Espinoza et&#160;al. 2014; Guhathakurta et&#160;al. 2017; Taylor et&#160;al. 2017; Thompson et&#160;al. 2017; Zilli et&#160;al. 2017). The observed shift in the trend distribution of precipitation extremes is more distinct than for annual mean precipitation and the global land fraction experiencing more intense precipitation events is larger than expected from internal variability (Fischer and Knutti 2014; Espinoza et&#160;al. 2018; Fischer et&#160;al. 2013). As a result of global warming, the number of record-breaking rainfall events globally has increased signi&#64257;cantly by 12% during the period 1981&#8211;2010 compared to those expected due to natural multi-decadal climate variability (Lehmann et&#160;al. 2015). The IPCC SR15 reports robust increases in observed precipitation extremes for annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day) (Hoegh-Guldberg et&#160;al. 2018; Schleussner et&#160;al. 2017). A&#160;number of extreme rainfall events have been attributed to human in&#64258;uence (Min et&#160;al. 2011; Pall et&#160;al. 2011; Sippel and Otto 2014; Trenberth et&#160;al. 2015; Krishnan et&#160;al. 2016) and the largest fraction of anthropogenic in&#64258;uence is evident in the most rare and extreme events (Fischer and Knutti 2014). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="231.54"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 231.54; y1: 241.04; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="231.54" x1="313.22">A warming climate is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle as a warmer climate facilitates more water vapour in the atmosphere, as approximated by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship, with subsequent effects on regional extreme precipitation events (Christensen and Christensen 2003; Pall et&#160;al. 2007; Berg et&#160;al. 2013; Wu et&#160;al. 2013; Guhathakurta et&#160;al. 2017; Thompson et&#160;al. 2017; Taylor et&#160;al. 2017; Zilli et&#160;al. 2017; Manola et&#160;al. 2018). Furthermore, changes to the dynamics of the atmosphere amplify or weaken future precipitation extremes at the regional scale (O&#8217;Gorman 2015; Pfahl et&#160;al. 2017). Continued anthropogenic warming is very likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in many regions of the globe (Seneviratne et&#160;al. 2012; Mohan and Rajeevan 2017; Prein et&#160;al. 2017; Stott et&#160;al. 2016) although many general circulation models (GCMs) underestimate observed increased trends in heavy precipitation suggesting a substantially stronger intensi&#64257;cation </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.3; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.57" x1="571.77">of future heavy rainfall than the multi-model mean (Borodina et&#160;al. 2017; Min et&#160;al. 2011). Furthermore, the response of extreme convective precipitation to warming remains uncertain because GCMs and regional climate models (RCMs) are unable to explicitly simulate sub-grid scale processes such as convection, the hydrological cycle and surface &#64258;uxes and have to rely on parameterisation schemes for this (Cr&#233;tat et&#160;al. 2012; Rossow et&#160;al. 2013; Wehner 2013; Kooperman et&#160;al. 2014; O&#8217;Gorman 2015; Larsen et&#160;al. 2016; Chawla et&#160;al. 2018; Kooperman et&#160;al. 2018; Maher et&#160;al. 2018; Rowell and Chadwick 2018). High-resolution RCMs that explicitly resolve convection have a better representation of extreme precipitation but are dependent on the GCM to capture the large scale environment in which the extreme event may occur (Ban et&#160;al. 2015; Prein et&#160;al. 2015; Kendon et&#160;al. 2017). Inter-annual variability of precipitation extremes in the convective tropics are not well captured by global models (Allan and Liu 2018). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="355.98" top="543.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 543.59; y1: 553.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="543.59" x1="355.98">There is </span><span style="x0: 358.03; x1: 360.14; y0: 543.59; y1: 553.09; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="358.03" y0="543.59" x1="417.3">low con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 419.35; x1: 421.46; y0: 543.59; y1: 553.09; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="419.35" y0="543.59" x1="571.85">in the detection of long-term observed and projected seasonal and daily trends of extreme snowfall.

This results in increased surface &#64258;ooding and soil erosion, increased plant water stress and reduced water security, which in terms of agriculture means an increased dependency on irrigation and reservoir storage (Nainggolan et&#160;al. 2012; Favis-Mortlock and Mullen 2011; Garc&#237;a-Ruiz et&#160;al. 2011; Li and Fang 2016; Chagas and Chaffe 2018). As there is high con&#64257;dence of a positive correlation between global warming and future &#64258;ood risk, land cover and processes are likely to be negatively impacted, particularly near rivers and in &#64258;oodplains (Kundzewicz et&#160;al. 2014; Al&#64257;eri et&#160;al. 2016; Winsemius et&#160;al. 2016; Arnell and Gosling 2016; Al&#64257;eri et&#160;al. 2017; Wobus et&#160;al. 2017). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="243.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 243.55; y1: 253.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.55" x1="571.77">In agricultural systems, heavy precipitation and inundation can delay planting, increase soil compaction and cause crop losses through anoxia and root diseases (Posthumus et&#160;al. 2009). In tropical regions, &#64258;ooding associated with tropical cyclones can lead to crop failure from both rainfall and storm surge. In some cases, &#64258;ooding can affect yield more than drought, particularly in tropical regions (e.g., India) and in some mid/high latitude regions such as China and central and northern Europe (Zampieri et&#160;al. 2017). Waterlogging of croplands and soil erosion also negatively affect farm operations and block important transport routes (Vogel and Meyer 2018; Kundzewicz and Germany 2012). Flooding can be bene&#64257;cial in drylands if the &#64258;oodwaters in&#64257;ltrate and recharge alluvial aquifers along ephemeral river pathways, extending water availability into dry seasons and drought years, and supporting riparian systems and human communities (Kundzewicz and Germany 2012; Guan et&#160;al. 2015).
