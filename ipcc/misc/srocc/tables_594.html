Data is from an update of the Integrated Assessment Modelling\nConsortium (IAMC) Scenario Explorer developed for the SR15 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a). The left panel A. shows bioenergy deployment over time\nfor the entire scenario database (grey areas) and the four illustrative pathways from SR15 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). The right panel B. shows global land area for energy\ncrops in 2100 versus total global bioenergy consumption in 2100; colours indicate the carbon price in 2100 (in 2010 USD per tCO2). Note that this fi gure includes\n409 scenarios, many of which exceed 1.5&#176;C.</td>

      <td>Synergistic outcomes with bioenergy are possible, for example, strategic integration of perennial bioenergy crops with conventional\ncrops can provide multiple production and environmental benefi ts, including management of dryland salinity, enhanced biocontrol\nand biodiversity, and reduced eutrophication (Davis et al. 2013; Larsen et al. 2017; Cacho et al. 2018; Odgaard et al. 2019). Additionally,\nplanting perennial bioenergy crops on low-carbon soil could enhance soil carbon sequestration (B&#225;rcena et al. 2014; Schr&#246;der et al.\n2018; Walter et al. 2015; Robertson et al. 2017a; Rowe et al. 2016; Chadwick et al. 2014; Immerzeel et al. 2014; Del Grosso et al. 2014;\nMello et al. 2014; Whitaker et al. 2018). However, large-scale expansion of bioenergy may also result in increased competition for land\n(DeCicco 2013; Humpen&#246;der et al. 2018; Bonsch et al. 2016; Harris et al. 2015; Richards et al. 2017; Ahlgren et al. 2017; B&#225;rcena et al.\n2014), increased GHG emissions from land-use change and land management, loss in biodiversity, and nutrient leakage (Harris et al.\n2018; Harper et al. 2018; Popp et al. 2011b; Wiloso et al. 2016; Behrman et al. 2015; Valdez et al. 2017; Hof et al. 2018). If biomass\ncrops are planted on land with a high carbon stock, the carbon loss due to land conversion may take decades to over a century to be\ncompensated by either fossil fuel substitution or CCS (Harper et al. 2018). Competition for land may be experienced locally or regionally\nand is one of the determinants of food prices, food security (Popp et al. 2014; Bailey 2013; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018; Rulli et al. 2016;\nYamagata et al. 2018; Franz et al. 2017; Kline et al. 2017; Schr&#246;der et al. 2018) and water availability (Rulli et al. 2016; Bonsch et al. 2015;\nPahl-Wostl et al. 2018; Bailey 2013; Chang et al. 2016; B&#225;rcena et al. 2014).</td>

      <td>Experience in countries at quite different levels of economic development (Brazil, Malawi and Sweden) has shown that persistent efforts\nover several decades to combine improved technical standards and management approaches with strong governance and coherent\npolicies, can facilitate long-term investment in more sustainable production and sourcing of liquid biofuels (Johnson and Silveira 2014).\nFor woody biomass, combining effective governance with active forest management over long time periods can enhance substitution-\nsequestration co-benefi ts, such as in Sweden where bioenergy has tripled during the last 40 years (currently providing about 25% of\ntotal energy supply) while forest carbon stocks have continued to grow (Lundmark et al. 2014). A variety of approaches are available at\nlandscape level and in national and regional policies to better reconcile food security, bioenergy and ecosystem services, although more\nempirical evidence is needed (Mudombi et al. 2018; Manning et al. 2015; Kline et al. 2017; Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Lamers et al. 2016).</td>

      <td>Thus, while there is high confi dence that the technical potential for bioenergy and BECCS is large, there is also very high confi dence\nthat this potential is reduced when environmental, social and economic constraints are considered. The effects of bioenergy production\non land degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity are scale and context specifi c (high confi dence). Large areas of\nmonoculture bioenergy crops that displace other land uses can exacerbate these challenges, while integration into sustainably\nmanaged agricultural landscapes can ameliorate them (medium confi dence).</td>
