<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par42">The specific heterarchic topology in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> depends on the integration of <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic> in the analysis. It thus differs from a straightforward SES or socio-technical systems approach. However, Geels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>) presents a socio-technical model of sustainability transitions that basically also represents a heterarchy. We think that this formal resemblance is necessary in order to transfer our topology of normative dynamics into other contexts of sustainability and improve our understanding of systemic interactions in different sustainability contexts. Therefore, for the purpose of analyzing other sustainability relevant non-scientific documents, especially those related to policy, we suggest that our approach should be directly applicable.</p>
