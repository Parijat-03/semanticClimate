<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par37">The specification of our model was selected through forward and backward stepwise regression using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. We first fit a baseline model that included all predictor variables included in Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and applied the <italic>stepAIC</italic> function from R&#8217;s <italic>MASS</italic> package with &#8220;both&#8221; as the direction of the selection technique. This command uses forward and backward stepwise regression to select the model specification that minimizes the AIC. We also performed ANOVA to test whether the final model selected through <italic>stepAIC</italic> is better at capturing that data than the baseline model. This enabled us to verify that the additional variables present in the baseline model do not significantly improve the fit of the model. We tested the assumption of no multicollinearity through the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test, using the general rule that if the VIF for all parameters is less than 5, there is no evidence of multicollinearity. We also tested for the proportional odds assumption using the Brant test, which assesses whether the observed deviations from the ordinal logistic model are larger than what could be attributed to chance alone. Although there is no single agreed upon measure of goodness-of-fit for logistic regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, we decided to include the McFadden Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> to assess the fit of our model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Higher values of McFadden Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> indicate a better model fit, and values between 20% and 40% are usually considered highly satisfactory.</p>
