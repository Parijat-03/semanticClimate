      <td>Increased food\nproductivity</td>
      <td>Increased food productivity arises when the output of\nfood commodities increases per unit of input, e.g., per\nunit of land or water. It can be realised through many\nother interventions such as improved cropland, grazing\nland and livestock management.</td>
      <td>Many interventions to increase food production, particularly\nthose predicated on very large inputs of agro-chemicals,\nhave a wide range of negative externalities leading to the\nproposal of sustainable intensification as a mechanism to\ndeliver future increases in productivity that avoid these\nadverse outcomes. Intensification through additional input\nof nitrogen fertiliser, for example, would result in negative\nimpacts on climate, soil, water and air pollution. Similarly,\nif implemented in a way that over-exploits the land, signifi-\ncant negative impacts would occur, but if achieved through\nsustainable intensification, and used to spare land, it could\nreduce the pressure on land.</td>

      <td>Improved cropland\nmanagement</td>
      <td>Improved cropland management is a collection of\npractices consisting of a) management of the crop:\nincluding high input carbon practices, for example,\nimproved crop varieties, crop rotation, use of cover\ncrops, perennial cropping systems, integrated production\nsystems, crop diversification, agricultural biotechnology,\nb) nutrient management: including optimised fertiliser\napplication rate, fertiliser type (organic manures, compost\nand mineral), timing, precision application, nitrification\ninhibitors, c) reduced tillage intensity and residue\nretention, d) improved water management: including\ndrainage of waterlogged mineral soils and irrigation\nof crops in arid/semi-arid conditions, e) improved rice\nmanagement: including water management such\nas mid-season drainage and improved fertilisation\nand residue management in paddy rice systems,\nand f) biochar application.</td>
      <td>Improved cropland management can reduce GHG\nemissions and create soil carbon sinks, though if poorly\nimplemented, it could increase nitrous oxide and methane\nemissions from nitrogen fertilisers, crop residues and\norganic amendments. It can improve resilience of food crop\nproduction systems to climate change, and can be used to\ntackle desertification and land degradation by improving\nsustainable land management. It can also contribute\nto food security by closing crop yield gaps to increase\nfood productivity.</td>
