After the Trump dispensation, President Biden has re-engaged the USA in the Paris Agreement and has become a strong advocate of collective international action to deal with climate change. In 2021, the USA announced a target cut of 50% of its carbon emissions by 2030 and pledged to reach net carbon zero by 2050. Biden has also reinstated the environmental regulations removed by Trump, put in major policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions and greatly increased federal funding for renewable energy and the US green economy. It is clear in the second half of Bill Gates&#8217;s book that he is addressing the US audience, as we have a whole chapter dedicated to showing why government matter. A gentle counter or push back against the neoliberal agenda of the last 40&#160;years. He uses positive examples of how governments have made environmental policies that have saved lives such as the UK Clean Air Act after the killer smog of the 1950s. He stops short of showing how states influence the aspirations of civil society through the rule of law and the development of policy. But he does show how they can use incentives, subsidies, taxation and regulation to help countries, particularly the USA, go carbon neutral. What many people do not realise is that governmental power and policy are the major drivers of innovation, through investment in university research, funding industrial R&amp;D and driving demand through incentives.</p>
