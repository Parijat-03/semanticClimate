<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0130">Scholarship has previously applied content analysis methods to investigate sustainable development topics for both public and private sector activities (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Wiese et&#160;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Searcy, 2010</xref>). It is worth investigating in detail sustainable development policy recommendations, rendering comprehensive information on SDGs, and more specifically access to finance and microfinance implementation for resilience action. A cogent argument to support the suitability of the content analysis for this study derives from the abundant and in-tune publication record in the different aspects tackled within this inquiry. Indeed, content analysis has been widely used as a technique to investigate sustainable development, microfinance and resilience research.</p>
