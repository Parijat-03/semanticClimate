<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par49">We use similarly clustered standard errors at census tracts as in the Tobit regression model (Eq.&#160;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). The odds ratios estimated from the logit estimation are presented in the tables of results. In estimating Eq.&#160;<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>, the sample is smaller than Eq.&#160;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> since properties that would have anyway been flooded, even without the additional precipitation attributed to climate change, are excluded. As such, the sample includes 793 to 795 census tracts as in some scenarios a few census tracts no longer had any valid observations (i.e., all parcels had flood depths/damages even with the reduced modeled precipitation).</p>
