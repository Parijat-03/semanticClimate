<italic>Laudato Si&#8217;, on the Care of Our Common Home</italic> is the second encyclical by Pope Francis. For the first time a Papal encyclical is devoted to environmentalism. Whereas encyclicals are usually addressed to the bishops of the Catholic Church, <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic> is addressed to every person on the planet. A summit at the Vatican on April 28, 2015 with the title &#8220;Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity&#8212;The Moral Dimensions of Climate Change and Sustainable Development&#8221; led to the &#8220;Declaration of Religious Leaders, Political Leaders, Business Leaders, Scientists and Development Practitioners&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> which foreshadowed the main content of <italic>Laudato Si&#8217;</italic>. The Encyclical was then introduced on June 18, 2015 in a press conference at the Vatican attracting extraordinary attention. Speakers were the Ghanaian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church Peter Turkson, the Eastern Orthodox metropolitan of Pergamon John Zizioulas, who is one of the most influential Orthodox Christian theologians today, the climate scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) John Schellnhuber, and Carolyn Woo, CEO and President of Catholic Relief Services and former dean of the Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame, USA.</p>
