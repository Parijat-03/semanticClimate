This suggests that that administrative capacity is the bottleneck to turn wind potential into installed capacity&#8212;the substantive and statistically significant effects of casino size support our speculation that richer jurisdictions tend to have stronger capacities to start wind energy projects, and most vitally, to push those projects to completion.</p>
