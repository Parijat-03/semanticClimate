In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1- 1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming .

In the low and very low GHG emissions scenarios, assumed reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to a net warming, while reductions in CH4and other ozone precursor emissions lead to a net cooling.

In the near-term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity . Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks  . Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise  (see Figure 3.4 and Figure 4.3). Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods .
