      <td>Green and renewable energy and transportation are emerging as important parts of climate change mitigation globally (medium evidence,\nhigh agreement) (McKinnon 2010; Zarfl et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2017). Evidence is, however, emerging across many biomes (from\ncoastal to semi-arid and humid) about how green energy may have significant trade-offs with biodiversity and ecosystem services,\nthus demonstrating the need for closer environmental scrutiny and safeguards (Gibson et al. 2017; Hernandez et al. 2015). In most\ncases, the accumulated impact of pressures from decades of land use and habitat loss set the context within which the potential\nimpacts of renewable energy generation need to be considered.</td>

      <td>Until recently, small hydropower projects (SHPs) were considered environmentally benign compared to large dams. SHPs are poorly\nunderstood, especially since the impacts of clusters of small dams are just becoming evident (Mantel et al. 2010; Fencl et al. 2015;\nKibler and Tullos 2013). SHPs (&lt;25/30 MW) are labelled &#8216;green&#8217; and are often exempt from environmental scrutiny (Abbasi and\nAbbasi 2011; Pinho et al. 2007; Premalatha et al. 2014b; Era Consultancy 2006). Being promoted in mountainous global biodiversity\nhotspots, SHPs have changed the hydrology, water quality and ecology of headwater streams and neighbouring forests significantly.\nSHPs have created dewatered stretches of stream immediately downstream and introduced sub-daily to sub-weekly hydro-pulses\nthat have transformed the natural dry-season flow regime. Hydrologic and ecological connectivity have been impacted, especially for\nendemic fish communities and forests in some sites of significant biodiversity values (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Jumani\net al. 2017, 2018; Chhatre and Lakhanpal 2018; Anderson et al. 2006; Grumbine and Pandit 2013). In some sites, local communities\nhave opposed SHPs due to concerns about their impact on local culture and livelihoods (Jumani et al. 2017, 2018; Chhatre and\nLakhanpal 2018).</td>

      <td>Semi-arid and arid regions are often found suitable for wind and solar farms which may impact endemic biodiversity and endangered\nspecies (Collar et al. 2015, Thaker, M, Zambre, A. Bhosale 2018). The loss of habitat for these species over the decades has been largely\ndue to agricultural intensification driven by irrigation and bad management in designated reserves (Collar et al. 2015; Ledec, George\nC.; Rapp, Kennan W.; Aiello 2011) but intrusion of power lines is a major worry for highly endangered species such as the Great Indian\nBustard (Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and conservation and mitigation efforts are being planned to address such concerns\n(Government of India 2012). In many regions around the world, wind-turbines and solar farms pose a threat to many other species\nespecially predatory birds and insectivorous bats (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Thaker, M, Zambre, A. Bhosale 2018) and\ndisrupt habitat connectivity (Northrup and Wittemyer 2013).</td>

      <td>Additionally, conversion of rivers into waterways has emerged as a fuel-efficient (low carbon emitting) and environment-\nfriendly alternative to surface land transport (IWAI 2016; Dharmadhikary, S., and Sandbhor 2017). India&#8217;s National Waterways seeks\nto cut transportation time and costs and reduce carbon emissions from road transport (Admin 2017). There is some evidence that\ndredging and under-water noise could impact the water quality, human health and habitat of fish species (Junior et al. 2012; Martins\net al. 2012), disrupt artisanal fisheries and potentially impact species that rely on echo-location (low evidence, medium agreement)\n(Dey Mayukh 2018). Off-shore renewable energy projects in coastal zones have been known to have similar impacts on marine fauna\n(Gill 2005). The Government of India has decided to support studies of the impact of waterways on the endangered Gangetic dolphin\nin order in order to plan mitigation measures.</td>

      <td>Responses to mitigating and reducing the negative impacts of small dams include changes in SHP operations and policies to enable\nthe conservation of river fish diversity. These include mandatory environmental impact assessments, conserving remaining undammed\nheadwater streams in regulated basins, maintaining adequate environmental flows, and implementing other adaptation measures\nbased on experiments with active management of fish communities in impacted zones (Jumani et al. 2018). Location of large solar\nfarms needs to be carefully scrutinised (Sindhu et al. 2017). For mitigating negative impacts of power lines associated with solar\nand wind farms in bustard habitats, suggested measures include diversion structures to prevent collision, underground cables and\navoidance in core wildlife habitat, as well as incentives for maintaining low-intensity rainfed agriculture and pasture around existing\nreserves, and curtailing harmful infrastructure in priority areas (Collar et al. 2015). Mitigation for minimising the ecological impact of\ninland waterways on biodiversity and fisheries is more complicated, but may involve improved boat technology to reduce underwater\nnoise, maintaining ecological flows and thus reduced dredging, and avoidance in key habitats (Dey Mayukh 2018).</td>
