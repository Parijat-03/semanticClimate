By livelihood we mean the capabilities, assets and activities required for a means of life that allows people to achieve a minimum level of wellbeing (Chambers &amp; Conway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1991</xref>). Climate change threatens these livelihoods and imposes the need for systematic and transformative adaptation which in turn calls for expanded and innovative financing.</p>
