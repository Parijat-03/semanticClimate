      <td>Paleoclimate evidence is integrated within multiple lines of evidence across the WGI Report to more fully understand\nthe climate system. Paleo evidence extends instrument-based observations of climate variables and climate drivers\nback in time, providing the long-term context needed to gauge the extent to which recent and potential future\nchanges are unusual (Section TS.2, Figure TS.1). Pre-industrial climate states complement evidence from climate model\nprojections by providing real-world examples of climate characteristics for past global warming levels, with empirical\nevidence for how the slow-responding components of the climate system operate over centuries to millennia &#8211; the\ntime scale for committed climate change (Core Concepts Box, Box TS.4, Box TS.9). Information about the state of\nthe climate system during well-described paleoclimate reference periods helps narrow the uncertainty range in the\noverall assessment of Earth&#8217;s sensitivity to climate forcing (Section TS.3.2.1). {Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, FAQ 1.3, FAQ 2.1}</td>

      <td>Paleoclimate reference periods. Over the long evolution of Earth&#8217;s climate, several periods have received extensive research\nattention as examples of distinct climate states and rapid climate transitions (Box TS.2, Figure 1). These paleoclimate reference periods\nrepresent the present geological era (Cenozoic; past 65 million years) and are used across chapters to help structure the assessment\nof climate changes prior to industrialization. Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 describes the reference periods, along with a brief account of their\nclimate forcings, and lists where each is discussed in other chapters. Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 summarizes information on one of the\nreference periods, the mid-Pliocene Warm Period.

      <td>Paleoclimate models and reconstructions. Climate models that target paleoclimate reference periods have been featured by\nthe IPCC since the First Assessment Report. Under the framework of CMIP6-PMIP4 (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project),\nnew protocols for model intercomparisons have been developed for multiple paleoclimate reference periods. These modelling efforts\nhave led to improved understanding of the climate response to different external forcings, including changes in Earth&#8217;s orbital and\nplate movements, solar irradiance, volcanism, ice-sheet size and atmospheric greenhouse gases. Likewise, quantitative reconstructions\nof climate variables from proxy records that are compared with paleoclimate simulations have improved as the number of study sites\nand variety of proxy types have expanded, and as records have been compiled into new regional and global datasets. {1.3.2, 1.5.1,\nCross-Chapter Boxes 2.1 and 2.4}</td>
