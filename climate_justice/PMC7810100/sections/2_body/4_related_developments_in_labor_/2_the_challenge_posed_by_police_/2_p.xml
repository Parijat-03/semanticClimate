Opponents of public sector bargaining have seized the opportunity to argue that bargaining should be outlawed for all public employees as all public employee unions are against the public interest (Cunningham-Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). Still others have contended that police unions could be part of the solution. (Malin and Slater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). The impact of the movement for racial justice has the potential to divide the labor movement, or to bring together coalitions of unions and other organizations dedicated to racial justice to work towards a common goal, or both.</p>
