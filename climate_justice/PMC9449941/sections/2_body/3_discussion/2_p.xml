To begin with, the IPPA approach opens up the view of several crucial issues of today&#8217;s major challenges in problem-oriented science and policy: firstly, it shows interacting and embedded policies bundled in a package. Second, it considers a heterogeneity of impact perspectives yielding to very different but similarly important results. Thirdly, it provides an overall view on consistently evaluating the different results. And finally, it provides opportunities to discuss the integrated scientific results from real-world perspectives of practice experts from administration/policy, civil society, and business. Thus, the overall IPPA approach may serve as a materialized blueprint approach for analysing policy packaging as policy advice.</p>
