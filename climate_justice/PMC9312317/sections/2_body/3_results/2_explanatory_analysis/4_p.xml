The effect is statistically significant for all three indicators. Thus, support for adaption is greater among individuals who oppose measures that go against the will of the majority of the people (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.827***), that slows economic growth or causes job loss (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.726***) and that could make social security arrangements worse (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.862*). By contrast, greater support for such radical measures is thus positively associated with greater support for a focus on mitigation in government&#8217;s climate policy. Thus, for the strongest effect, of support for measures that go against economic growth and causes job losses, a one-unit increase on the 5-point scale of agreement makes respondents roughly 23 percent less likely to support (equal) priority for adaptation.</p>
