Scaled up, agroecology can help end poverty and hunger and help mitigate global warming by enriching soils that sequester carbon and by using fewer fossil fuels. It also uses far fewer pesticides and herbicides, uses water more efficiently than industrial agriculture, and is more resilient to climate change (Altieri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Extension could simultaneously work to mitigate the racial biases in regenerative agriculture by centering Black and Indigenous agricultural knowledge (Wozniacka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2021</xref>).</p>
