We are critical criminologists and our instinct is to look at the crimes of the powerful, identify the hypocrisy, and argue for a reversal in the logic of law. Our impulse is often to call for tougher penalties for corporate criminals. There is no shortage of studies and articles and books in which I, together with colleagues, including Anne Alvesalo, Steven Bittle, Andrew Moretta, Frank Pearce, Laureen Snider and Steve Tombs, have argued for criminalization of the powerful. Yet, we have never argued that criminalization could ever be <italic>the</italic> solution to corporate crime. When it comes to proposals for a new law of ecocide, it is clear that the doctrinal and political odds are stacked against such an offense being adopted and implemented with the intensity that could make even the slightest ripple in the balance of social forces. At the same time, we should not oppose such proposals as out of hand. Law is always a site of struggle, and the utility of each struggle depends on weighing the likely long-term gains (not just measured in legal terms, but also measured in terms of enhancing the prospects for building a movement). We just need to be realistic about the prospect of legal struggles for saving the planet.</p>
