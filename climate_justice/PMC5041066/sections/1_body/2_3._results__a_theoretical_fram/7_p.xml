<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Within the social domain, gender-related indicators are of high importance as they are acknowledged as highly relevant [<xref rid="B58-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], yet remain under-theorized in climate change adaptation research output [<xref rid="B60-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The roles of intersectionality and gender in climate change assessments are still ill-defined and mostly limited to discussions on vulnerability differences between women and men [<xref rid="B61-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This extends to climate change, adaptation, and health research, and is unsurprising considering the debates on integration of intersectionality concepts and gender-sensitive approaches to data collection and analysis in social epidemiology [<xref rid="B63-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Despite these difficulties, increasing awareness of gender as a category worth exploring in adaptation evaluation promises greater applicability of strategies to different population groups [<xref rid="B66-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
