<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This training programme aims to engage health workers at different levels of public service (policy-makers, health managers and clinicians) and to strengthen interdisciplinary academia formal and informal networks. As such, it provides a practical link between clinical practice and broader Health in All Policies capacity development and advocacy. The role of advocacy is extremely important for ensuring the engagement of clinicians in civic movements for fairer societies with essential conditions for health equity. To ensure the continuous education programme is relevant to physicians, a range of teaching methods is used, including the use of audio-visual aids, the use of vignettes describing situations confronting clinicians when treating patients as regards the social determinants of health, including learning from simulation (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Paroz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and the study of real clinical cases.</p>
