<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This work calls for Integrated Knowledge to Action (iKTA) [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] which is necessary to foster partnerships with a range of experts, social organizations, intergenerational collaborators, mentors, and community organizations to develop a series of projects with and for children/youth from diverse communities, geographies, and socio-cultural backgrounds. Community-based projects and insights are central in developing actions on climate change at the local level. IKTA can provide a framework for building collaborations between children/youth and intergenerational allies using a variety of tools and processes including art, education, and techniques in climate adaptation and mitigation. Outputs from interdisciplinary research should be diverse due to the diverse social locations and backgrounds of the participants involved. Outputs may include academic research papers, conference presentations and policy briefs that are co-produced with children/youth, and/or knowledge translation materials actively defined by children- and youth-collaborators with a goal of feeding knowledge into the communities, groups, and institutions that are important in their lives [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Knowledge Synthesis Reports and briefs can be effective tools when advocating for system-level change, and plain-language reports can be used to ensure that the findings are contextualized and culturally appropriate.</p>
