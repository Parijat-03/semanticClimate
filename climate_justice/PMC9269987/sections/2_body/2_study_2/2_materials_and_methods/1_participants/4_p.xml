<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A sensitivity analysis using G*Power (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) indicated that with the given sample size of <italic>N</italic> = 880, &#945; = 0.05, and a power of 1 &#8211; &#946; = 0.80, linear multiple regression with 10 predictors (four justice sensitivities, moral disengagement in high carbon behavior, guilt, shame, authentic and hubristic pride, gratitude) could detect small effect sizes of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.02 and with a power of 1 &#8211; &#946; = 0.95 could detect small effect sizes of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.03. As these effect sizes are even smaller than those we found in Study 1, the sample size can be regarded as being sufficient to reliably quantify the effects.</p>
