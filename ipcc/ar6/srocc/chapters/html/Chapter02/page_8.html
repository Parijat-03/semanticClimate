Therefore, changes in air temperature have different consequences for snow cover, permafrost and glaciers at different elevations. A number of studies have reported that trends in air temperature vary with elevation, a phenomenon referred to as elevation dependent warming (EDW; Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein), with potential consequences beyond those of uniform warming. EDW does not imply that warming is larger at higher elevation, and smaller at lower elevation, but it means that the warming rate (e.g.,&#160;in &#186;C per decade) is not the same across all elevation bands. Although this concept has received wide attention in recent years, the manifestation of EDW varies by region, season and&#160;temperature indicator (e.g., daily mean, minimum or maximum temperature), meaning that a uniform pattern does&#160;not&#160;exist.&#160;The identi&#64257;cation of the underlying driving mechanisms for EDW and how they combine is complex.</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.64" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 77.92; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="579.54" x1="551.64">Several physical processes contribute to EDW, and quantifying their relative contributions has remained largely elusive (Minder&#160;et al., 2018; Palazzi et al., 2019). Some of the processes identi&#64257;ed are similar to those explaining the ampli&#64257;ed warming in the polar regions (Chapter&#160;3). For example, the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcing is increased at low temperatures common in both polar and mountain environments (Ohmura, 2012). Because the relationship between speci&#64257;c humidity and downwelling radiation is nonlinear, in a dry and cold atmosphere found at high elevation, any increase in atmospheric humidity due to temperature increase drives disproportionately large warming (Rangwala et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Snow-albedo feedback plays an important role where the snow cover is in decline (Pepin and Lundquist, 2008; Scherrer et al., 2012), increasing the absorption of solar radiation which in turn leads to increased surface air temperature and further snowmelt. Other processes are&#160;speci&#64257;c to the mountain environment. Especially in the tropics, warming can be enhanced at higher elevation by a reduction of the vertical temperature gradient, due to increased latent heat release above the condensation level, favored in a warmer and moister atmosphere (Held and Soden, 2006). The cooling effect of aerosols, which also cause solar dimming, is more pronounced at&#160;low elevation and reduced at high elevation (Zeng et al., 2015). While many mechanisms suggest that warming should be enhanced at high elevation, observed and simulated EDW patterns are usually more complex (Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein). Numerical simulations by global and regional climate models, which show EDW, need to be considered carefully because of&#160;intrinsic limitations due to potentially incomplete understanding and implementation of relevant physical processes, in addition to coarse grid spacing with respect to mountainous topography (M&#233;n&#233;goz et al., 2014; Winter et al., 2017). </span></div></body></html>
