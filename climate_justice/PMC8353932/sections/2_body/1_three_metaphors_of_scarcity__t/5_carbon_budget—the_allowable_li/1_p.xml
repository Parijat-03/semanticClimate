While the idea of a temperature threshold can be used to convey what level of warming will be dangerous, it still needs to be translated into a more &#8216;actionable&#8217; policy target to meet the temperature goal (Geden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). The scientific concept of a <italic>carbon budget</italic>&#8212;the finite amount of allowable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to stay below a given temperature&#8212;facilitates the discursive translation of a temperature goal into a mitigation target for reducing global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to net zero (Rogelj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2019</xref>; Matthews et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>).</p>
