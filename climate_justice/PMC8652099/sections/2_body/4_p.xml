Although, methane concentration in atmosphere is just 2 parts per millions (PPM) as compared to CO<sub>2</sub> (412 PPM), but it has capacity to trap heat 84 times more than CO<sub>2</sub> thus making it a nuisance as far as global warming is concerned (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/cop26-report-card-methane-s-role-in-global-warming-in-sharp-focus-for-the-first-time-80176">https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/cop26-report-card-methane-s-role-in-global-warming-in-sharp-focus-for-the-first-time-80176</ext-link>). This was the first time that an event was dedicated on methane as &#8216;global methane pledge&#8217; proposed by US and EU, to reduce methane emissions by 30% from levels of 2020 by 2030. The pledge was signed by 105 nations, but the top three methane producing countries (China, India and Russia) that are responsible for about 35% of methane in atmosphere did not sign it.

Agriculture, land use and forestry have intricate linkages with global warming and are responsible for around quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. There were expectations that COP26 would witness marked changes in food and agricultural system such as shifting towards sustainable consumption of meat and dairy, but that also showed no concrete achievements.</p>
