<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0110">The relationship between the incidence of WNV infections (per 100,000) and the climate, land-use, and economic factors was modeled via a Generalized Additive Model (GAM), which also accounted for the spatial and temporal auto-correlation. One of the main issues with our data-set is that it does not meet some basic assumptions for statistical inference, and specifically the data are not independent and identically distributed random variables (iid). More specifically, the data-set captured repeated measurements over the same regions, and observations were not independent because of spill over effects from neighboring regions. Therefore, spatial auto-correlation in the GAM model was approximated by a Markov random field (MRF) smoother, defined by the geographic areas and their neighborhood structure. We used R's Spdep package <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> to create a queen neighbors list (adjacency matrix) based on regions with contiguous boundaries i.e. those sharing one or more boundary point. We used a full rank MRF, which represented roughly one coefficient for each area. The local Markov property assumes that a region is conditionally independent of all other regions unless regions share a boundary. This feature allowed us to model the correlation between geographical neighbors and smooth over contiguous spatial areas, summarizing the trend of the response variable as a function of the predictors (see Section 5.4.2 of <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In order to account for variation in the response variable over time, not attributed to the other explanatory variables in our model, we used a saturated time effect for years, where a separate effect per time point is estimated.</p>
