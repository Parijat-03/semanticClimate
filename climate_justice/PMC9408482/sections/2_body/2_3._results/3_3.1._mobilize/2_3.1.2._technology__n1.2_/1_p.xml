The LDPCs need technologies for preparedness against climate change. This includes, but is not limited to, &#8220;early warning systems&#8221;, &#8220;smart agriculture technologies&#8221;, &#8220;efficient-energy&#8221;, and flood-resistant infrastructure (Eritrea p. 25, Kiribati p. 3, South Sudan p. 145). With this technology transfer, they also require knowledge (N2.1) and techniques (N2.2) to utilize them (Lesotho and Burundi). This process of technology transfer, as Angola notes, requires partnership (4.2) and institutional (N3.1) arrangements. Djibouti (p. 14) acknowledges its partnership with Germany and technological support in the energy sector for renewable energies (N5.3). </p>
