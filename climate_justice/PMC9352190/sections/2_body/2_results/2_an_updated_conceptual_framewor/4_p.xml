<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0007">This revitalized framework primarily builds on the work of Lieber et&#160;al. <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, in addition to the features described above, there are a few more differences and modifications. First, this framework focused solely on the impact of climate change on HIV/AIDS, and did not include the reverse - for instance, how HIV/AIDS care can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions leading to further worsening of the climate crisis. Including this dimension will make the framework much more complicated and more difficult to be used in practice, especially for HIV/AIDS programs in climate-vulnerable settings. It could be therefore said that this framework focuses more on climate adaptation for HIV/AIDS programs, but the important role of climate mitigation within the health sector is in no way underestimated. Moreover, other large-scale ecosystem changes such as biodiversity loss and land use change were also excluded from this framework. While these ecosystem alterations are also related to climate change in different ways, they also have their own causes and consequences and will entail the inclusion of additional pathways, making the framework much more complicated and too expansive for HIV/AIDS programming.</p>
