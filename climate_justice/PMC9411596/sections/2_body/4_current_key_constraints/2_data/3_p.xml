Cloud computing and machine learning have the potential to improve the tailoring of climate predictions at scale. Technologies such as drones, social media and mobile phones, combined with transparent data analytics, have the potential to reduce the cost and time required to create locally relevant and frequently updated geospatial and socio-economic datasets. However, accelerating the adoption of new capabilities and processes will require capacity building and knowledge generation and diffusion across stakeholders, in both the public and private sectors. In addition, local and system-based expert knowledge needs to be an intrinsic part of the end-to-end data architecture and governance. The reason is not only because of critical issues such as data equity and ethical concerns but also&#160;to ensure that assumptions and input information are valid and that outputs are targeted at assessing the climate resilience of social, economic and biodiversity systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>&#8212;making maladaptive practices less likely. This is required in every country, not only in developing countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
