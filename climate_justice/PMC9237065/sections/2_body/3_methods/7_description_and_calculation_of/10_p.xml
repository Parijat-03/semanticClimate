The work of Kikstra et al. provides estimates of country-explicit energy requirements to achieve sufficient nutrition, housing, and transportation to meet established standards of living. We utilize these estimates to allocate a portion of the EU effort-sharing budget as a priority measure to be used in meeting basic needs thresholds for the portion of the population most at risk of poverty.</p>
