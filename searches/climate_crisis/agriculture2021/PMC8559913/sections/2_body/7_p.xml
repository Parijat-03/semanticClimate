The capability of the WMO&#8217;s Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) to support a comprehensive security and sustainability agenda should be developed. The pooling and integration of relevant data can begin in tandem with the development of more appropriate standardized and timely reporting and information systems and institutional, regulatory and governance structures.</p>
