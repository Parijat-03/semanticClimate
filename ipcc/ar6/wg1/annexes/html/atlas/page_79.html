Particularly relevant for this region are increased model resolution and a better representation of the 16 land-surface processes in many of the models that participated in CMIP5. The spread in climate model 17 projections is still substantial, partly due to large amounts of natural variability in this region (particularly 18 NAO and AMO). Storm track biases in the North Atlantic have improved slightly, but models still produce a 19 storm track that is too zonal and underestimate cyclone intensity.  20 21 Studies assessed in SR1.5 have clearly identified a possible amplification of temperature extremes by 22 changes in soil moisture, acting as a mechanism that further magnifies the intensity and frequency of 23 heatwaves related to summer drying conditions.
