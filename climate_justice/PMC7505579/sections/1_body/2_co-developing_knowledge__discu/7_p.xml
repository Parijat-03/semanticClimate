Scaling well-proven methods of deliberative democracy to reach critical mass can show the road to relevant or accepted policies and communication activities towards the general public <xref rid="b0595" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>: engaged citizens of truly diverse profiles in such discussion platforms are free of agenda and vested interests <xref rid="b0600" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>; as such they are representative of the diversity of their country or community <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>, and hence reflect the blockades and drivers for change. They furthermore go through a condensed process of education, through interaction with experts and other stakeholders, as well as deliberation, since the diverse groups go through a process of collective intelligence <xref rid="b0610" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>. They can, therefore, output a set of recommendations that find collective acceptance because of this inclusive, fact-based, deliberative process <xref rid="b0615" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>, thereby overcoming &#8216;societal ceilings&#8217; <xref rid="b0620" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref> boosting uptake of sustainable lifestyles <xref rid="b0625" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>.</p>
