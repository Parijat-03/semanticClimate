<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The positive prediction of pro-environmental intention by guilt stands in line with existing literature (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Carrus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rees et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Hurst and Sintov, 2022</xref>). However, in our study, guilt was not only a significant predictor but also a mediator. We, therefore, recommend devoting more attention to different theoretical and statistical associations than simple predictions. The data of our study suggest that the predictive power of shame was comparably small which is consistent with the results of an experimental study by <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rees et al. (2014)</xref> who showed that the combination of guilt and shame into a &#8220;guilty conscience&#8221; construct was a stronger predictor of pro-environmental behavior than each of them taken separately. However, in their study, it was shame and not guilt that transformed the intention into manifest behavior. Consequently, shame may play a role in the implementation of pro-environmental intentions. Yet, the body of literature on shame is not as abundant as is on guilt; therefore, it is difficult to compare their respective influences.</p>
