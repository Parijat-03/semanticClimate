For instance, the USA consume roughly 240 GJ per capita, and the EU 127 GJ per capita (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), both having very high HDI well above 0.8. Possibly, it could not be demanded that these countries lower their GJ per capita, and consequently lower their HDI, since their capabilities are then curtailed.</p>
