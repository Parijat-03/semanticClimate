Similarly, in Central Asia, the shifting of water storage for irrigation to power development has increased risks on reliable water supply and quality of water (Granit et&#160;al., 2012). Deforestation-driven agro-environmental changes have led to a decreased forest water supply, an increased irrigation water demand and a negative effect on cropland stability and productivity (Lim et&#160;al., 2017a; Lim et&#160;al., 2019b).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="156.58" top="606.48"><span x0="54.14" y0="606.48" x1="156.58" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.94; y0: 606.48; y1: 616.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.3.3 Knowledge gaps</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.7" top="582.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="582.6" x1="307.7" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 61.53; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Many challenges remain in both scientific research and policy actions at the global, regional, national and subnational levels. The scientific challenges include data, information and knowledge gaps in understanding the food, energy, water and land interlinkages, and lack of systematic tools to address trade-offs (Liu et&#160;al., 2017a). Until very recently, implementation of the food&#8211;energy&#8211;water nexus focused primarily on technical solutions, whereas governance (i.e., the institutions and processes governing the food&#8211;energy&#8211;water nexus) has not received much consideration (Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019). At the policy end, the common challenges for implementation of the water&#8211;energy&#8211;food&#8211;land nexus are absence of sectoral coordination (Pahl-Wostl, 2019), the influence of political priorities on decisions and lack of processes for scientific knowledge to shape decisions, lack of capacity to understand interlinkages between sectors, lack of multi-stakeholder engagement in planning and decision-making processes, and lack of incentive mechanisms and adequate finance to support the approach (Bao et&#160;al., 2018; Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="196.39" top="354.48"><span style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.34; y0: 354.48; y1: 364.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="54.14" y0="354.48" x1="196.39">10.6.4 Social Justice and Equity</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.71" top="330.6"><span x0="54.14" y0="330.6" x1="307.71" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.36; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Social justice focuses on the justice-related implications of social and economic institutions, examined in different ways such as distributional justice (distribution of benefits and burdens across different societal groups), procedural justice (the design of just institutions and processes for decision making), inter-generational justice (duties of justice to future generations) and recognitional justice (recognition of historical inequality) (Thaler et&#160;al., 2017). Climate change is affecting every aspect of our society and economy; thus, it is pertinent to understand the interactions between social justice and climate-change impacts (Tol, 2018), in particular, focusing on how vulnerability to various impacts is created, maintained and distributed across geographic, social, demographic and economic dimensions (Bulkeley et&#160;al., 2014; Schlosberg and Collins, 2014; Van de Vliert, 2014; Burke et&#160;al., 2016). For instance, environmental and health consequences of climate change, which disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in high-income countries, profoundly affect human rights and social justice (Levy and Patz, 2015). Furthermore, great concern is expressed about the plight of the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable populations when it comes to climate, but not in other policy domains (Winters, 2014).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="78.63"><span x0="54.14" y0="78.63" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.54; y0: 78.63; y1: 88.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Evidence is increasing on the importance of focusing on environmental sustainability, and relieving poverty and social injustice are not conflicting aims; in fact, there is a further need for mainstreaming </span></div><div left="318.18" right="569.5" top="714.64"><span x0="318.18" y0="714.64" x1="569.5" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 320.29; y0: 714.64; y1: 724.14; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">in a socially just manner (Mayrhofer and Gupta, 2016). These non-conflicting aims are described as co-benefits as reiterated in the IPCC reports as a central concept that refers to &#8216;the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, irrespective of the net effect on overall social welfare&#8217; (IPCC, 2014b). Better understanding of how social justice affects, and is affected by, efforts to build adaptive capacity will be crucial to avoiding unintended, and even perverse, outcomes. For example, on the Andaman coast of Thailand, responses to climate-change trends and events tended to be reactive rather than proactive, making already vulnerable people even more vulnerable and undermining their capacity to adapt in the future (Bennett et&#160;al., 2014). Different forms of inequality, moreover, render some groups more vulnerable than others to damage from climate hazards. In Mumbai, India, for example, the houses of poorer families required repeated repairs to secure them against flood damage, and the cumulative cost of those repairs consumed a greater proportion of their income than for richer populations (UN, 2016). Building the resilience of vulnerable groups requires strong community and government institutions that can support efforts to cope with devastating events, offering SP and social development initiatives to support at-risk or vulnerable groups (Drolet et&#160;al., 2015). In addition, agencies need to consider how they can best work in ways which potentially support longer-term positive change to gender roles and relations. For example, post-disaster activities must build and resource women&#8217;s resilience and adaptive capacity in practice and challenge the constraints that impinge on their lives (Sadia et&#160;al., 2016; Sohrabizadeh et&#160;al., 2016; Hadiyanto et&#160;al., 2018; Yumarni and Amaratunga, 2018; Alam and Rahman, 2019).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.75" top="366.68"><span x0="318.18" y0="366.68" x1="571.75" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 320.48; y0: 366.68; y1: 376.18; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Insights from the environmental justice literature show that an overemphasis on emission reductions at national levels obscures the negative impacts on disadvantaged communities, including low-income communities (Burch and Harris, 2014). The issue of social justice and adaptation is particularly relevant because of the politics that drive how adaptation and recovery efforts, as well as investments, are targeted towards specific populations, places and capacities (Klinsky et&#160;al., 2017). Hence, climate justice and equity need to be highlighted more explicitly in integrative approaches to mitigation and adaptation (</span><span style="x0: 363.69; x1: 370.55; y0: 258.7; y1: 268.2; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="363.69" y0="258.7" x1="491.55">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span x0="491.55" y0="258.7" x1="571.77" style="x0: 491.55; x1: 494.19; y0: 258.7; y1: 268.2; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Moellendorf, 2015; Henrique KP, 2020).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="222.7"><span x0="318.18" y0="222.7" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 222.7; y1: 232.2; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The term &#8216;climate justice&#8217; is used to problematise global warming in ethical and political contexts. It does so by employing the concepts of environmental justice and social justice to examine inequalities and violation of human collective rights in relation to climate-change impacts (Ghimire, 2016).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.78" top="150.71"><span x0="318.18" y0="150.71" x1="571.78" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.64; y0: 150.71; y1: 160.21; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">At the heart of climate-justice concerns lies the asymmetry that those who have contributed least to the problem of climate change (i.e., GHG emissions) are the ones who will be affected by its adverse impacts the most. It is about sharing the burden and benefits equitably (a) among developed and developing countries in the context of historical responsibility, and (b) within nations to uplift the marginalised and affected populations who have contributed the least to the problem in the contexts of per-capita equity and local vulnerability (Joshi, 2014; Chaudhuri, 2020; Shawoo, 2020).</span></div></body></html>
