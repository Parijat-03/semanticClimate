      <td>Physical climate storylines are complementary to probabilistic or unconditional risk-based approaches, and are particularly suitable to\nexplore low-likelihood changes or events, which are often associated with the highest impacts (Shepherd et al., 2018; Sillmann et al.,\n2020; Section 4.8). They also facilitate providing local context to large-scale trends and changes, by conditioning the projections on\nlocally relevant circumstances (Hazeleger et al., 2015). Storylines are also developed based on expert elicitation and include plausible\nchanges beyond those simulated by existing model projections in order to explore deep uncertainties (Dessai et al., 2018).</td>

      <td>Storylines can be combined with impact modelling (Strasser et al., 2019; Hegdahl et al., 2020) and can be embedded in a user&#8217;s\nrisk landscape (Shepherd, 2019; Box 10.2, Figure 1). In particular, this holds for event storylines, where confounding factors such as\nregional characteristics like land-use changes and non-climatic drivers of the event are an element of the storyline (Pisaric et al., 2011;\nDessai et al., 2018; Lloyd and Shepherd, 2020; Sillmann et al., 2021). In a co-production process, multidisciplinary expert knowledge\nas well as the values and interests of the intended audiences and stakeholders can be explicitly considered (Kok et al., 2014; Bhave\net al., 2018; Dessai et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018; Hegdahl et al., 2020).</td>

      <td>Storylines can also be used to communicate climate information by narrative elements describing the main climatological features and\nthe relevant consequences in the user context (Fl&#248;ttum and Gjerstad, 2017; Moezzi et al., 2017; Dessai et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018;\nJack et al., 2020). Co-produced narratives have been demonstrated to enhance knowledge integration in decision-making contexts\n(e.g., de Bruijn et al., 2016). Narrative elements have also been employed to convey information from climate models (Corballis, 2019).\nJack et al. (2020) introduced the concept of climate risk narratives and developed a set of principles, such as using present tense in\ntheir presentation to avoid the effects of future discounting and writing individual narratives without uncertainty language to assume\nan imagined observer perspective. From this point of view, event storylines are particularly useful for communication purposes as they\nlink to the experience and episodic memory of stakeholders (Schacter et al., 2007; Steynor et al., 2016; Shepherd et al., 2018).</td>

      <td>Box 10.2, Figure 1 | Schematic of two types of physical climate storylines with a particular climate impact of concern (red). The storylines are\ndefined by specified elements (dark blue). Variable elements (light blue) are simulated conditional on the specified elements. The white elements are &#8216;blocked&#8217; since\ntheir state does not need to be known to determine the light blue elements. Other types of storylines could be defined by specifying other elements (e.g., storylines\nof different climate sensitivities or different representative concentration pathways). (a) Event storyline, where the particular dynamical conditions during the event\nas well as the regional warming are specified and control the hazard arising from the event. (b) Dynamical storyline, where the global warming level and remote\ndrivers are specified and control the long-term changes in atmospheric dynamics and regional warming. In both storylines, the impact is also conditioned on specified\nexposure and vulnerability. Figure adapted from Shepherd (2019).</td>
