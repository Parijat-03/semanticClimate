<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this study, we explore the social networks and topics discussed at the first virtual-only IDWeek on Twitter. Similar to previous studies, there was a substantial amount of tweets, retweets, and user activity related to this medical conference. When compared with IDWeek 2016 (3249 tweets from 488 users) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there was nearly a 4-fold increase in tweet activity and 7-fold increase in users. This large uptick may be a result of expected growth on the Twitter platform or the virtual format of the conference, which lent itself to increased internet access and impetus for virtual connection. With over half of all tweets representing retweets, there was clear evidence of amplification of original messages, facilitating sharing of ideas and thoughts. This permits engagement in conversation and is one of the most attractive reasons for using this medium.</p>
