      <td>Differentiated impacts, vulnerability, risk perception,\nbehaviours and coping strategies for climate change related\nto food security derive from cultural (gendered) norms.\nThat is, the behaviours, tasks, and responsibilities a society\ndefines as &#8216;male&#8217; or &#8216;female&#8217;, and the differential gendered\naccess to resources (Paris and Rola-Rubzen 2018; Aberman\nand Tirado 2014; Lebel et al. 2014; Bee 2016). In many rural\nareas women often grow most of the crops for domestic\nconsumption and are primarily responsible for storing,\nprocessing, and preparing food; handling livestock; gathering\nfood, fodder and fuelwood; managing domestic water supply;\nand providing most of the labour for post-harvest activities\n(FAO 2011a). They are mostly impacted through increased\nhardship, implications for household roles, and subsequent\norganisational responsibilities (Boetto and McKinnon 2013;\nJost et al. 2016). Water scarcity can particularly affect women\nbecause they need to spend more time and energy to collect\nwater, where they may be more exposed to physical and\nsexual violence (Sommer et al. 2015; Aipira et al. 2017).\nThey may be forced to use unsafe water in the household\nincreasing risk of water-borne diseases (Parikh 2009).\nClimate change also has differentiated gendered impacts on\nlivestock-holders&#8217; food security (McKune et al. 2015; Ongoro\nand Ogara 2012; Fratkin et al. 2004) (Supplementary Material\nTable SM5.1).</td>
