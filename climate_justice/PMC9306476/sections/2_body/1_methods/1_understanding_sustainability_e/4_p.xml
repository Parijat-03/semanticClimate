<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Between March and August 2021, we conducted 60&#8208;min virtual interviews with key informants from each TropEd institution. We searched the institution websites for contact persons relating to sustainable operations, research or education in sustainability and reached out to them via email. We also used general information or department email addresses to ask to be put in touch with the appropriate person. If we were unable to find a contact person, we worked with the coordination team of the TropEd network to reach out to member institutions. If there was more than one key informant, we conducted a small group interview, and if anyone was not comfortable taking part in an interview in English, we offered to do the interview with a translator. With permission, we recorded the interviews and transcribed the audio using the Sonix online tool to help take note of all the information [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
