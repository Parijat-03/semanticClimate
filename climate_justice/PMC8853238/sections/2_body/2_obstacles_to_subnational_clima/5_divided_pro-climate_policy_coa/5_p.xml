With more diverse leadership, including women, people of color and Indigenous people, a new approach is emerging that links climate/energy policy with jobs and economic justice, health, food, housing, and transportation. Several states and cities have proposed ambitious Green New Deal policies, such as New York&#8217;s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Boyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>). This approach focuses on justice-oriented policies and direct investments in under-invested in households and communities. For example, climate justice proponents are now pushing for more equitable housing and community development, equitable access to clean and affordable energy, and more inclusive public engagement around climate policy development (Clifton and Kelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). An expansion of the &#8220;just transition&#8221; concept includes worker protections and recognition of fossil-dependent communities and consumers (Healy and Barry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017</xref>).</p>
