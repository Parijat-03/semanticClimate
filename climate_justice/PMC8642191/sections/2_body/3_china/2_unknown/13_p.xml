<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par56">Overall, a 2019 study of green financial development since 2011 concluded that &#8216;the degree of green financial development in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> is relatively low at present&#8217; (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>, 979). China&#8217;s government has estimated that the green credit provided by the 21 &#8216;major financial institutions in banking&#8217; in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> reached around 7.51 trillion yuan by the end of 2016 or around 8.83 per cent of all loans (PRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2018</xref>, 157). There is also evidence that green finance has developed unevenly in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref>, with a gap between the more prosperous coastal cities and provinces and inland regions (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>). The process of aligning finance flows within <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> with the Article 2.1c goal remains at an early stage, and the absence of a taxonomy-like tool of general application (as opposed to a green bond catalogue) may impede whole-of-economy transformation of finance flows. Evidently, however, the 30/60 targets are providing new impetus, and further initiatives can be expected.</p>
