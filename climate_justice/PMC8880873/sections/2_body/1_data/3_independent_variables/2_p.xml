<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Arguably, support for wind energy might reflect the desire for energy self-sufficiency and energy sovereignty [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and not directly related to climate change. Thus, we also consider the tribes that were members of CERT (Council of Energy Resource Tribes) before it disbanded in 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. CERT advocated for tribal energy independence and economic independence, but it was indifferent as to what forms of energy development tribes used. For example, some members had a lot of coal mining, while others were pursuing renewables. In addition to CERT, our model also controls the presence of fossil fuel extraction on tribal lands. The intuition is that a high salience of this industry might create a pressure group that dissuades tribal government from embarking on wind projects, which eventually seek to phase out fossil fuel from electricity generation. An alternative expectation, however, is that tribes involved in fossil fuel extraction might develop the business experience that would then aid wind projects.</p>
