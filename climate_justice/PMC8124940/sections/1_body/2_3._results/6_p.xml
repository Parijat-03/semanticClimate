<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Results from the GEE using September NDVI as the dependent variable (<xref rid="ijerph-18-04800-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) indicate a significantly positive association (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the proportions of children, SCs, agricultural workers, households with assets, and households with electricity, but a negative relationship (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) with the proportions of literate residents, households owning homes, and households of larger size. A one standard deviation increase in the proportion of children, SCs, agricultural workers, households with assets, and households with electricity is associated with about 1.7%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 2.4%, and 1.4% increases in values of the September UHRI, respectively, while a one standard deviation increase in the proportion of literate residents, households owning homes, and households of larger size is associated with about 2.0%, 0.9%, and 1.6% decreases in the September UHRI, respectively. Although the proportions of children and agricultural workers indicated a non-significant association with the NDVI in May (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.30), both these independent variables show a significantly positive relationship (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with the September NDVI.</p>
