Most of the shortfall will have to be filled from domestic sources, requiring stimulation of domestic &#8216;green finance&#8217;. The financial policies applied to achieve climate goals build on the &#8216;financialisation&#8217; of the Chinese economy, which began in the 1990s (Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2019</xref>, 213&#8211;14). As elsewhere, financialisation in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> involved creation of markets for trading securities. Unlike in many other countries, however, financialisation was not accompanied by privatisation of the largest businesses and banks. Rather, &#8216;[f]inancialization of the state refers to the process in which the Chinese state transforms its management of the economy from administrative intervention and fiscal allocation to supervising its massive state assets according to shareholder value&#8217; (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>, 621). Chinese financialisation is essentially state-led (for an overview of this phenomenon, see Walter and Howie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>)). &#8216;Green finance&#8217; is no exception.</p>
