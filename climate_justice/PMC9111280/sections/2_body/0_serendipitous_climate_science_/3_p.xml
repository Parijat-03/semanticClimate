Bauwens et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), using the metric of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide, revealed significant declines in air pollution. Venter et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) also provided a comprehensive global analysis using in&#8208;situ and satellite data. Their study included nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. Le Qu&#233;r&#233; et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) revealed that carbon dioxide emissions were also lower during COVID&#8208;19 lockdowns. Though temporary and unsustainable as human activity normalized after 2020, the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown unequivocally revealed that human activities affect climate&#8208;warming greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. The lockdown provided a glimpse into how changes in anthropogenic activity can reduce emissions and could be used as guidance for future policy decisions.</p>
