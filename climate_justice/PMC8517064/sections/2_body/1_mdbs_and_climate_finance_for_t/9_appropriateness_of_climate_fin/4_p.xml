For example, an intervention may implement sustainable, diversified food production systems with climate resilient crop varieties, and &#8220;climate proof&#8221; infrastructure across a value chain. In such a context, a combination of grant, concessional loan, and equity resources may be justifiable to provide adequate incentives to achieve a desired result. For example, the Planting Climate Resilience Project in Brazil is a blended finance project that includes a loan of $US 65 million and a grant of $34.5 million from the Green Climate Fund, $30 million from IFAD and $73 million from Brazil&#8217;s National Social and Economic Development Bank (BNDES). Technical assistance and higher risk initial investment in climate resilient production systems are financed with a blend of grant and concessional loans from GCF, while well proven investments in water harvesting/management and agroprocessing are financed through IFAD and BNDES loans.</p>
