Similar to anthropogenic climate change detection (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution in Chapter&#160;1), signal emergence can be detected, at least initially, without identifying the physical causes of the emergence (Section&#160;1.4.2). In the context of human influence on climate, the objective of emergence studies is the search for the appearance of a&#160;signal characterizing an anthropogenically-forced change relatively to the climate variability of a&#160;reference period, defined as the noise.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="342.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="342.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.26; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Precise definitions of signal and noise as well as a&#160;metric to measure the relative importance of the signal are key ingredients of the emergence framework and depend on the framing question. In particular, emergence study results can depend on the specific definitions of signal and noise such as the level of spatial and temporal aggregation (McSweeney and Jones, 2013). For instance, grid-point scale emergence will likely be delayed compared with region-average emergence (Section&#160;11.2.4 and Cross-Chapter Box&#160;Atlas.1, Figure&#160;2; Fischer et&#160;al., 2013; Maraun, 2013b; Lehner et&#160;al., 2017a). The signal is often estimated by a&#160;running mean multi-decadal average or probability distribution function of the physical variable under scrutiny in order to avoid false emergence due to manifestation of multi-decadal internal variability (King et&#160;al., 2015). In the case of extremes such as climate records, a&#160;notion of multi-year persistence or recurrence can also be used to fully characterize the anthropogenic signal and its emergence (Christiansen, 2013; Bador et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="138.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="138.6" x1="304.76" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.09; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Emergence is also sensitive to the noise characteristics: assuming a&#160;common signal definition, larger signal-to-noise values and earlier emergence will arise if the noise is based on decadal mean variability rather than interannual variability (Kusunoki et&#160;al., 2020). Depending on the framing question, the noise can include or omit external natural forcing such as volcanic and solar forcing (Zhang and Delworth, 2018; Silvy et&#160;al., 2020). Furthermore, emergence results are very sensitive to the choice and length of the reference </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 318.02; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">the very recent past or even a&#160;time-evolving baseline, depending on both the framing and assumption that adaptation to the current climate has already occurred (King et&#160;al., 2015; Zhang and Delworth, 2018; Brouillet and Joussaume, 2020). These choices will then determine the type of simulations and periods that will be used to construct the noise distribution. Finally, the permanence of future emergence cannot be taken for granted when emergence occurs in the late-21st&#160;century based on simulations ending in 2100 (Hawkins et&#160;al., 2014; King et&#160;al., 2015; Lehner et&#160;al., 2017a).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="594.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="594.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Robust assessments and comparisons of past emergence between observations and models are strengthened by the use of consistent definitions of signal and noise (Lehner et&#160;al., 2017a; Hawkins et&#160;al., 2020). In the case of future emergence under increasing greenhouse gas emissions, two main approaches have been followed to assess emergence. The first is based on estimating the signal and noise (and sometimes the signal-to-noise ratio as well) in individual models before using the resulting distribution median or mean to construct the final emergence metric (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; Maraun, 2013b; Sui et&#160;al., 2014; Barrow and Sauchyn, 2019). The second method first estimates the signal as a&#160;multi-model mean change and the noise variance as a&#160;combination of internal variability and model structural differences (Giorgi and Bi, 2009; Mariotti et&#160;al., 2015; Nguyen et&#160;al., 2018). The first approach allows the definition of emergence of the signal relative to internal variability only and treats model error as source of uncertainty (Maraun, 2013b; Lehner et&#160;al., 2017a). The second assumes that the multi-model mean is the optimal estimate of the signal and confounds internal variability and model structural differences in the noise estimate. It is noteworthy that most emergence studies implicitly assume model independence (Annan and Hargreaves, 2017; Bo&#233;, 2018; Box&#160;4.1) and therefore sensitivity of emergence results to model selection or weighting is rarely performed (Akhter et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="306.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="306.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 322.6; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Metrics can vary from a&#160;simple signal-to-noise ratio to statistical distributional tests (King et&#160;al., 2015; Gaetani et&#160;al., 2020) and give median estimates and uncertainty bounds for the date (or time of emergence) corresponding to the exceedance of specific thresholds by the emergence metric. Reconciling future emergence results among different studies is challenging due to their many methodological differences including the choice of the reference period, the selected climate models and scenario, the precise definition of signal and noise and the choice of different signal-to-noise thresholds to characterize robust emergence. Contrasting with binary yes/no statements, emergence can also be viewed as a&#160;continuous process characterized by an amplitude or level, for example the value of the signal-to-noise ratio, that is a&#160;function of time or global warming level.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="138.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="138.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Since AR5, the development and production of SMILEs (Sections&#160;4.2.5 and 10.3.4.3) has allowed the assessment of the influence of internal variability on anthropogenic signal emergence. The influence of internal variability, and specifically of the unforced atmospheric circulation, on temperature signal emergence can delay or advance the time of emergence by a&#160;decade or two in mid- to high-latitude regions (Lehner et&#160;al., 2017a; Koenigk et&#160;al., 2020). Internal variability can also result in small or decreasing decadal to multi-decadal </span></div></body></html>
