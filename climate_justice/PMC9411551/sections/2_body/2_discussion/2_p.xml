The world has warmed by more than 1&#8201;&#176;C already<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The common frame of analyzing how climate change might have inequitable social impacts in the future is important but incomplete. We believe an equally important line of inquiry should focus on how climate change is already having unequal social impacts now. Already, this theme is emergent in research on topics like climate migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We believe that social science analysis of climate change-attribution impacts of extreme weather events can further substantiate the major (and inequitable) impacts climate change is having in our world today.</p>
