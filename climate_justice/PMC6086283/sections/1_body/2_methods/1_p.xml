<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par12">The analytical approach in this paper makes use of the three documents as an entry point for an analysis of the complex system of normativity related to sustainability discourse (Oppermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). To analyze the system of norms in the three documents, we systematically identified the main entities and actors that are guided and influenced by norms. We could identify entities at three different levels: 1. Macro-level, 2. Meso-level, and the 3. Micro-level. We took the three levels as representing the discursive structure of the three texts and focused on specific norms related to the entities on each level as well as their dynamical interactions.</p>
