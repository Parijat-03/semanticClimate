Santals once dominated the village numerically. Today they comprise approximately 20 per cent of the population due to immigration by Bengalis and most Santals have become Christian. Bengali Muslims account for 75 per cent and Hindus &#8211; 5 per cent<xref ref-type="fn" rid="EN0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>of the population. Key informants claimed that the overwhelming nature of Bengali immigration, combined with low literacy rates among Santals, resulted in the latter losing almost all their land to Bengalis. Today, Santals hold less than 10 per cent of the land. The majority of Santal women and men work as day labourers, as do many low-income Muslim women and men.</p>
