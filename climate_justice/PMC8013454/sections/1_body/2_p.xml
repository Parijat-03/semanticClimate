<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Through this Forum, we hope to present some anthropological perspectives on the recent phenomenon of mass climate protests in Europe and beyond. Knowing that many anthropologists have been involved in the context of climate activism, we want to rekindle reflections on our discipline&#8217;s stake in and influence on transitions to a different world in the aftermath of the Covid&#8208;19 pandemic. We are interested in thinking about how we, as anthropologists, could work with and alongside the climate justice movement, both as individuals who advise and spread knowledge and as a well&#8208;established and networked institution. In our opinion, during these times of multiple intersecting crises, anthropologists have the urgent task to ponder the role that the discipline has to play in fomenting social change and offering political alternatives. We know now for certain that the generations to come will have to deal with an unstable world <italic>and</italic> grapple with the lurking possibility of deadly pandemics. We hope that this Forum will help to show that anthropologists are poised to become interlocutors of environmental movements, but also that their knowledge can make a difference for humans and other beings as they face the impacts of climate change and for the generations of earthlings to come. Ultimately, we want to take stock of the stories that anthropology can tell to influence the outcome of the planetary crisis of climate change, because, as Jonathan Safran Foer cogently put it, &#8216;History not only makes a good story in retrospect; good stories <italic>become</italic> history&#8217; (<xref rid="soca13005-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>: 16).</p>
