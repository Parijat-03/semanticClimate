<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The question arises as to the degree to which Santal women are able to use their personal agency to overcome the &#8220;power over&#8221; and the hidden forms of agency which combine to keep them left behind. An analytic model presented in the Introduction (see Figure A1) posited that four structural drivers underpin marginalisation processes: (1) an inadequate asset base; (2) poor access to services and infrastructure; (3) weak political voice, empowerment and institutional governance; and (4) identity-based exclusion and social norms. The first three structural drivers &#8211; assets, services and voice &#8211; can also act as &#8220;enablers&#8221; to lift people out of poverty. However, the processes of identity-based exclusion &#8211; and the social norms which underpin and &#8220;rationalise&#8221; this &#8211; are an underlying driver preventing marginalised people (including middle-income Muslim women) from accessing and using the first three drivers to their advantage.</p>
