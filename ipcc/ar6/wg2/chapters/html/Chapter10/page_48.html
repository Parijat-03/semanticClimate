(2020) who found that structural interventions in existing drainage systems reduce flooding risk by 7&#8211;19% in Sylhet (Bangladesh) and Bharatpur (Nepal); however, without proper solid waste management, areas under flood risk could increase to 18.5% in Sylhet and 7.6% in Bharatpur in five&#160;years, rendering the infrastructural interventions ineffective over time. While in some cities it is estimated that infrastructural adaptation through &#8216;hard&#8217; flood protection strategies (e.g., storm surge barriers and floodwalls) is more effective than institutional or ecosystem-based adaptation by 2100, for example, Shanghai. A hybrid approach where hard strategies protect from flood risk, and soft strategies reduce residual risk from hard strategies, is suggested (Du et&#160;al., 2020). In Japan, without adaptation, estimated damage costs of floods (caused by tropical cyclones and altered precipitation) by 2081&#8211;2100 under RCP2.6 will be 28% higher (compared with 1981&#8211;2000), rising to 57% higher under RCP8.5 (Yamamoto et&#160;al., 2021). With a combination of adaptation measures (such as land-use control, piloti building and flood control measures), estimated damage costs can be reduced even below the 1981&#8211;2000 levels, and with a combination of mitigation and these adaptation measures, an estimated 69% reduction in flood damage costs are expected&#8211;demonstrating the importance of concerted and immediate climate action in reducing damage.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.09" top="354.65"><span x0="42.52" y0="354.65" x1="296.09" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 354.65; y1: 364.15; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Infrastructural interventions can sometimes be maladaptive when assessed over longer time periods: for example, the Mumbai Coastal Road (MCR) project aimed at reducing flood risk and protecting against SLR will potentially cause damages to intertidal fauna and flora and local fishing livelihoods (Senapati and Gupta, 2017); and Jakarta&#8217;s Great Garuda project aimed at reducing flood risk is expected to </span><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.63; y0: 282.66; y1: 292.16; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="42.52" y0="282.66" x1="74.34">increase </span><span x0="74.34" y0="282.66" x1="290.72" style="x0: 74.34; x1: 79.09; y0: 282.66; y1: 292.16; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">flood risk for the poorest urban dwellers (Salim et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="245.41" top="258.66"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.08; y0: 258.66; y1: 268.16; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="42.52" y0="258.66" x1="245.41">10.4.6.4.2 Sustainable land-use planning and regulation</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.12" top="234.66"><span x0="42.52" y0="234.66" x1="296.12" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.39; y0: 234.66; y1: 244.16; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Land use in cities impacts resource use (e.g., water, energy), risk (a function of population density, service provision and hazard exposure) and adaptive capacity, all of which influence the efficacy of urban adaptation (de Coninck et&#160;al., 2018). Locally suited land-use planning and regulation (such as appropriate zoning or building codes and safeguarding land rights) can have adaptation co-benefits (Mitchell et&#160;al., 2015; Dhar and Khirfan, 2016): for example, strict building regulations can protect urban wetlands and associated ecosystem services (Jiang et&#160;al., 2015); appropriate land zoning can safeguard green spaces, ensure improvements in permeability and obviate new development in risk-prone locations (Duy et&#160;al., 2019); and ensuring </span></div><div left="42.52" right="559.55" top="82.44"><span x0="42.52" y0="82.44" x1="559.55" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 45.89; y0: 82.44; y1: 89.44; width: 3.37; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: BGTYRB+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;">9 Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is defined by IPBES as the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of natural ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change (Glossary, 2019). In urban areas, EbA includes improving ecological structures (e.g., maintaining watersheds, forests, green roofs), ecological functions and processes (e.g., wetland functioning for flood protection), valuation measures (including monetary or non-monetary values to ecosystem service benefits) and investing in ecosystem management practices (i.e., enabling adaption co-benefits through the maintenance, preservation and restoration or creation of ecological structures) (Liu et&#160;al., 2014a; Brink et&#160;al., 2016). Thus, EbA adaptation actions include protecting urban green spaces, improving permeability, fostering urban agriculture, mangrove restoration in coastal cities, improved wetland management and so forth (Doswald et&#160;al., 2014; Brink et&#160;al., 2016; de Coninck et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.14" top="714.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="714.6" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 308.68; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">improvements to housing quality, thereby alleviating vulnerability of the most marginal people (Mitchell et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.12" top="678.61"><span x0="306.57" y0="678.61" x1="560.12" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.43; y0: 678.61; y1: 688.11; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Land tenure arrangements strongly shape urban dwellers&#8217; vulnerability and their adaptive capacities (Roy et&#160;al., 2013; Michael et&#160;al., 2018). For example, in Khulna (Bangladesh), Roy et&#160;al. (2013) found significant differences between the adaptive strategies of homeowners and renters in low-income settlements, a finding echoed in Bangalore (India) (Deshpande et&#160;al., 2018) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) (Mitchell et&#160;al., 2015). In Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), land-based adaptation strategies include land zoning to control population and building density, demarcating environmental protection zones, and sub-urbanisation (Nahiduzzaman et&#160;al., 2015; Rahman et&#160;al., 2016). In many Asian cities, land subsidence control can serve as an adaptation strategy since it is estimated to significantly reduce relative SLR (</span><span style="x0: 468.17; x1: 472.75; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="468.17" y0="546.62" x1="523.91">high confidence</span><span x0="523.91" y0="546.62" x1="560.35" style="x0: 523.91; x1: 526.55; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). This has an important implication in that subsidence control would be a good and complementary measure to climate mitigation and climate adaptation in many coastal urban settings in Asia (Cao et&#160;al., 2021; Nicholls et&#160;al., 2021). Urban land-use planning, if used proactively, can incentivise adaptation&#8211;mitigation synergies and obviate unintended negative consequences of urbanisation as Xu et&#160;al.
