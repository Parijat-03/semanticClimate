The impacts will vary across states, sectors, locations and populations. Consequently, there can be no one-size-fits all climate change strategy. Hence, it is required that approaches designed will need to be tailored to fit state and local vulnerabilities and conditions. In keeping with the wider objectives of the NAPCC, the Prime Minister called on the states and the union territories to initiate the preparation of State Action Plans consistent with the strategies in the National Plan in an address on August 18, 2009. To support the states in this complex undertaking, Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) circulated a set of guidelines for the states: &#8220;A framework for the preparation of State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC)&#8221; in November 2010. Each state government has been directed to formulate its own state level policy on climate change to coordinate the implementation of the national plan at the state level.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="385.15" top="547.68"><span x0="72.02" y0="547.68" x1="385.15" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 547.68; y1: 559.68; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.2Need for State Level Action Plans on Climate Change </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.18" top="520.08"><span x0="72.02" y0="520.08" x1="508.18" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 83.35; y0: 520.08; y1: 532.08; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">With the formulation of a national policy on climate change, it has become imperative to achieve coherence between the strategies and actions at national and state levels. Adaptation challenges are experienced most acutely at the state level. The governments (both national and state) have considerably enhanced budgetary outlays for development over the years; the livelihoods of communities in rural and urban areas remain vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Unless adequate actions are taken at the state level, climate change may become a major impediment to the endeavor of realizing national development priorities including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, there is an urgent need for State Governments to prepare SAPCC, which will enable them to understand the uncertainty of future climatic conditions and engage effectively in a process of developing adaptation programmes.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.25" top="349.42"><span x0="72.02" y0="349.42" x1="508.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 349.42; y1: 361.42; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The processes of intervention will focus more on the local level covering all the formal as well as informal sectors.  In the process of preparation of such action plan, there may be the requirement to re-look into existing policies of the state with the perspective of reframing and restructuring along with creating mechanism for integration/coordination at sectoral and spatial level.   </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.1" top="257.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="257.95" x1="508.1" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 257.95; y1: 269.95; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In Jan 2009, GNCTD became the first federal state to have adopted a Climate Mitigation and Adaption Plan</span><span x0="161.54" y0="247.52" x1="165.56" style="x0: 161.54; x1: 165.56; y0: 247.52; y1: 255.56; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">4</span><span x0="168.74" y0="242.11" x1="508.12" style="x0: 168.74; x1: 177.4; y0: 242.11; y1: 254.11; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">within the broad outlines of National Action Plan on Climate Change. A framework for implementing a series of action under the plan was initiated by the GNCTD. The plan had a 65-point four-year agenda to fight climate, the plan further had been consolidated to 36 agenda points. It basically, aimed to encourage use of solar power, increase in use LEDs, setting up of an electronic waste facility, more CNG buses to promote public transport, promoting use of bio-fuel and shutting down coal fired power plants. It also planned to encourage reuse of construction waste, increase green cover by developing more city forests and parks, preserve natural heritage, create Biodiversity Parks, enrich biodiversity of existing greens, restore water bodies and reuse waste water.
