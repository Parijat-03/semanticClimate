      <td>that uses continual monitoring of crop and livestock\nperformance to actively inform management practices.\nPrecise monitoring of crop performance over the course of\nthe growing season will enable farmers to economise on their\ninputs in terms of water, nutrients and pest management.\nTherefore, it can contribute to both the food security (by\nmaintaining yields), sustainability (by reducing unnecessary\ninputs) and land sparing goals associated with SI. The\nsite-specific management of weeds allows a more efficient\napplication of herbicide to specific weed patches within\ncrops (Jensen et al. 2012). Such precision weed control has\nresulted in herbicide savings of 19&#8211;22% for winter oilseed\nrape, 46&#8211;57% for sugar beet and 60&#8211;77% for winter wheat\nproduction (Gutjahr and Gerhards 2010). The use of on-farm\nsensors for real time management of crop and livestock\nperformance can enhance farm efficiency (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman\net al. 2014). Mapping soil nutrition status can allow for more\ntargeted, and therefore more effective, nutrient management\npractices (Hedley 2015). Using wireless sensors to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as soil moisture, has the\npotential to allow more efficient crop irrigation (Srbinovska\net al. 2015). Controlled traffic farming, where farm machinery\nis confined to permanent tracks, using automatic steering\nand satellite guidance, increases yields by minimising soil\ncompaction. However, barriers to the uptake of many of these\nhigh-tech precision agriculture technologies remain. In what\nis described as the &#8216;implementation problem&#8217;, despite the\npotential to collect vast quantities of data on crop or livestock\nperformance, applying these data to inform management\ndecisions remains a challenge (Lindblom et al. 2017).</td>

Where intensive land use has led to land degradation,\nmore diverse land-use systems, such as intercropping, can\nprovide a more sustainable land-use option with co-benefits\nfor food security, adaptation and mitigation objectives. For\nexample, in temperate regions, highly productive agricultural\ngrasslands used to produce meat and dairy products\nare characterised by monoculture pastures with high\nagrochemical inputs. Multi-species grasslands may provide\na route to SI, as even a modest increase in species richness\nin intensively managed grasslands can result in higher forage\nyields without increased inputs, such as chemical fertiliser\n(Finn et al. 2013; Sanderson et al. 2013; Tilman et al. 2011).\nRecent evidence also indicates multispecies grasslands have\ngreater resilience to drought, indicating co-benefits for\nadaptation (Hofer et al. 2016; Haughey et al. 2018).</td>
