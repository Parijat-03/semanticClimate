<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0135">Second on the spectrum of risk are those who, through CM or MR, resettle in a new place but face new physical hazards such as an earthquake, floods, or landslides (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Carrasco et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Huang, 2018</xref>) as well as new livelihood risks. For example, the thousands of people who migrated from rural Bangladesh to the slums of Dhaka found their new location was not safer, and their migration contributed to landlessness, indebtedness, and poverty (<xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">Rana and Nessa, 2017</xref>). Third, are those that face either physical or livelihood risk in the resettlement sites, but not both. An example in the case of MR are urban poor residents in Manila who were resettled to the outskirts of the city which had low flood risk compared to Manila City but limited livelihood options (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ajibade, 2019</xref>). Both categories two and three reflect risk substitutions across geographic spaces rather than meaningful adaptation.</p>
