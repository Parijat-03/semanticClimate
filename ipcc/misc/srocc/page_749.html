Implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation has been impeded by institutional barriers, including multi-level governance and policy integration issues (Biesbroek et al. 2010). To overcome these barriers, climate governance has evolved signi&#64257;cantly beyond the national and multilateral domains that tended to dominate climate efforts and initiatives during the early years of the UNFCCC. The climate challenge has been placed in an Earth System context, showing the existence of complex interactions and governance requirements across different levels, and calling for a&#160;radical transformation in governance, rather than minor adjustments (Biermann et al. 2012). Climate governance literature has expanded since AR5 in relation to the sub-national and transnational levels, but all levels and their interconnection is important. Expert thinking has evolved from implementing good governance at high levels (with governments) to a decentred problem-solving approach consistent with adaptive governance. This approach involves iterative bottom-up and experimental mechanisms that might entail addressing tenure of land or forest management through a territorial approach to development, thereby supporting multi-sectoral governance in local, municipal and regional contexts (FAO 2017b). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.22" top="99.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.06; y0: 99.57; y1: 109.07; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="99.57" x1="313.22">Local action in relation to mitigation and adaptation continues to be important by complementing and advancing global climate policy (Ostrom 2012).

A transformation of sorts has been underway through deepening engagement from the private sector and NGOs as well as government involvement at multiple levels. It is now recognised that business organisations, civil society groups, citizens, and formal governance all have important roles in governance for sustainable development (Kemp et al. 2005).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="627.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 627.59; y1: 637.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="627.59" x1="571.76">Transnational governance efforts have increased in number, with applications across different economic sectors, geographical regions, civil society groups and NGOs. When it comes to climate mitigation, transnational mechanisms generally focus on networking and may not necessarily be effective in terms of promoting real emissions reductions (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017). However, acceleration in national mitigation measures has been determined to coincide with landmark international events such as the lead up&#160;to&#160;the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference 2009 (Iacobuta et al. 2018). There is a tendency for transnational governance mechanisms to lack monitoring and evaluation procedures (Jordan et al. 2015a).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="483.6"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 483.6; y1: 493.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="483.6" x1="571.77">To address shortcomings of transnational governance, polycentric governance considers the interaction between actors at different levels of governance (local, regional, national, and global) for a&#160;more nuanced understanding of the variation in diverse governance outcomes in the management of common-pool resources (such as forests) based on the needs and interests of citizens (Nagendra and Ostrom 2012). A more &#8216;polycentric climate governance&#8217; system has emerged that incorporates bottom-up initiatives that can support and synergise with national efforts and international regimes (Ostrom 2010). Although it is clear that many more actors and networks are involved, the effectiveness of a more polycentric system remains unclear (Jordan et al. 2015a). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="353.24" top="327.61"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 327.61; y1: 337.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="327.61" x1="353.24">There is </span><span style="x0: 352.88; x1: 357.46; y0: 327.61; y1: 337.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="352.88" y0="327.61" x1="411.8">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 411.44; x1: 414.25; y0: 327.61; y1: 337.11; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="411.44" y0="327.61" x1="571.77">that a hybrid form of governance, combining the advantages of centralised governance (with coordination, stability, compliance) with those of more horizontal structures (that allow &#64258;exibility, autonomy for local decision-making, multi-stakeholder engagement, co-management) is required for effective mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation in sustainable land and forest management (Keenan 2015; Gupta 2014; Williamson&#160;and Nelson 2017; Liniger et al. 2019). Polycentric institutions self-organise, developing collective solutions to local problems as they arise (Koontz et al. 2015).

Climate adaptation and mitigation goals must be integrated or mainstreamed into existing governance mechanisms around key land-use sectors such as forestry and agriculture. In the EU, mitigation has generally been well-mainstreamed in regional policies but not adaptation (Hanger et al. 2015). Climate change </span></div></body></html>
