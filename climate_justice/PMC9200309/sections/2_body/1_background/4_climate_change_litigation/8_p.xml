<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Interestingly, eco-centric law is becoming a reimagination of the anthropocentric foundations of the international legal system. Eco-centric concepts are transforming human-centered legal systems, that historically undervalue non-human life. This is based on newly articulated eco-centric ideas that &#8220;to treat nature as just one of several competing (economic) interests results in a tendency to trump more qualitative public interest notions, such as ecosystem protection, intergenerational and intragenerational equity and even cultural values&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This represents a profound departure from an anthropocentric framing of the environment as a mere resource-giving vehicle for human exploitation towards viewing the environment in Kantian terms, as &#8220;an end in itself&#8221;, as a legal entity with rights of protection.</p>
