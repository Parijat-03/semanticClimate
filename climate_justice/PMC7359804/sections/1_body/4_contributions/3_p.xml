<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0150">The papers, firstly, establish a <italic>practice of recognition of mobility injustice</italic> in a manner that, at the same time, politicises the understanding of injustice, and refines the attention to the complex and dynamic roles that different mobility subjects play in constructing (in)just configurations. This is achieved by analysis of the political economy of transport and mobility injustice, showing how conceptual frameworks such as spatial justice and the right to the city can be expanded with a mobile ontology, providing empirical cases of differential (im)mobilities and the ways these are (re)produced in and through government policy. Secondly, the contributions take the <italic>responsibility of generating</italic> just mobilities by documenting and enabling processes of resistance and bottom-up co-creation, in line with the aforementioned society-centred approach to justice. This is achieved by adding the <italic>critical and reflexive discussion of various participatory methods</italic> to the existing repertoire of methodological practices for examining transport and mobility justice, and by highlighting justice as an emergent outcome of the everyday practices of various <italic>urban actors who challenge and address transport and mobility injustice</italic> through a wide range of strategies.</p>
