<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Activating a new consciousness &#8211; one that leads to the very possibility of
enacting counter-hegemonic and transgressive visions and practices of inhabiting
a more equal city &#8211; is at the core of the schools working under the umbrella of
HIC-AL. In the school driven by <italic toggle="yes">Corporaci&#243;n Regi&#243;n</italic> and
<italic toggle="yes">Fuerza Incluyente</italic> in Medell&#237;n, this translates into the
ways in which an inclusive city is approached: not as one that accommodates the
needs and experiences of people with disabilities through marginal artefacts and
ad hoc interventions such as ramps, but rather by turning accessibility and
mobility for all as a default position from which the city is planned and
managed. In a similar vein, FUCVAM&#8217;s schools of cooperativism do not build
houses to be traded as assets in the real estate market, but as homes to be
inhabited, as concrete political practices that reclaim the social function of
housing and land in cities &#8211; where, as expressed in the title of their short
film, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;the dwelling is not the end, it is the beginning&#8221;</italic>.</p>
