Since 1975 this willingness to cooperate is articulated under the Mediterranean Action Plan &#8211; Barcelona Convention and its related protocols (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>). Likewise, the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development 2016&#8211;2025 (MSSD) aims to promote regional and national plans, by improving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (UNEP/MAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Among other objectives, the MSSD sets out that addressing climate change must be a priority for the Mediterranean and recognizes that climate change constitutes a severe risk for economic growth and development in this area. Moreover, since 2008, the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) promotes cooperation among countries from the European Union and 15 countries from the South and East of the Mediterranean. Among other things, the UfM mandate is to support and advise its member countries on the elaboration, review, and implementation of their climate action commitments within the Paris Agreement context (Union for the Mediterranean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>).</p>
