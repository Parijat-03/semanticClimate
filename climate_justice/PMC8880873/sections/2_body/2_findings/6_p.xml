We find that federal assistance for wind energy, which often allows tribal governments to hire individuals with technical skills, is associated with wind installed capacity. How do politics affect wind energy capacity? The quest for wind energy reflects the desire for energy self-sufficiency and sovereignty. Indeed, we find that tribes who joined CERT (Council of Energy Resource Tribes) are more likely to have wind turbines. This suggests that wind installed capacity reflects concerns about energy sovereignty as well. To our surprise, we find that the fossil fuel industry is positively correlated with wind energy. Arguably, experience with the fossil fuel industry might provide tribes with business acumen and administrative capacity to deal with non-tribal businesses interested in wind energy development.</p>
