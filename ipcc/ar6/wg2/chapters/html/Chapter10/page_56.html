Countries such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka have included provisions for &#8216;climate-smart agriculture&#8217; in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) (Amjath-Babu et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.13" top="534.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="534.63" x1="296.13" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 534.63; y1: 544.13; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the domain of forest adaptive governance, ever since the introduction of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus (REDD+) at COP 13 in 2007 in Bali, the Indonesian experience suggests that some of the major challenges include curbing emissions, changes in cross-sectoral land-use as well as practice within forestry and lack of effective, efficient and equitable implementation of diverse forest governance practices. The issue of how forest governance institutions are conceived and managed, both at national and subnational levels, involving state, private sector and civil society, also needs serious attention (Agung et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.1" top="402.64"><span x0="42.52" y0="402.64" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In an example from Nepal, Clement (2018) showed that deliberative governance mechanisms can create the space for alternative framings of climate change to take a hold in ways that are cognisant of both the local and global contexts; this moves beyond a dependence on techno-managerialism in the construction of solutions, where local governance solutions can support institutional changes. The possibilities more incorporating deliberative methods into wider governance architecture are also expanded through an acknowledgment of the role of social learning; this is observable in the multi-stakeholder involvement that this approach fosters in regions of South Asia such as the Brahmaputra River basin (Varma and Hazarika, 2018). Additionally, recent studies have reconfirmed the importance of linking Indigenous knowledge with the scientific knowledge of climate change in diverse regions of the globe, including Asia and Africa (Hiwasaki et&#160;al., 2014; Etchart, 2017; Taremwa et&#160;al., 2017; Vadigi, 2017; Apraku et&#160;al., 2018; Inaotombi and Mahanta, 2018; Makondo and Thomas, 2018) for building farmers&#8217; resilience, enhancing CCA, ensuring cross-cultural communication, promoting local skills, drawing upon Indigenous Peoples&#8217; intuitive thinking processes and geographic knowledge of remote areas.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.08" top="162.67"><span x0="42.52" y0="162.67" x1="296.08" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 162.67; y1: 172.17; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A study of the Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, deploying a knowledge quality assessment tool, found significant correlation between a narrow technocratic problem framing, divorced from traditional knowledge strongly rooted in local sociocultural histories and relatively low project success due to skewed risk-based calculations disconnected from the ground realities (Haque et&#160;al., 2017; Wani and Ariana, 2018). Highlighting the vulnerability of the Bajo tribal communities, who inhabit the coastal areas of Indonesia, to climate change, the study showed how they share several examples of their Indigenous knowledge and traditions of marine resource conservation, and how </span></div><div left="306.56" right="544.67" top="714.69"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.69" x1="544.67" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.13; y0: 714.69; y1: 724.19; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">been passed from generation to generation through oral tradition.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="492.88" top="690.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="690.48" x1="492.88" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 690.48; y1: 700.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.1.3 Knowledge Gaps and Future directions</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.17" top="666.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="666.6" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.38; y0: 666.6; y1: 676.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">One of the major knowledge gaps in the domain of climate adaptation governance relates to implementation by various stakeholders at multiple scales, and sharing of information and experiences in this regard. There is a need to assuage the perceptions of distrust in global information, through governance methods that engage multiple stakeholders in open and lucid channels of communication (Stott and Huq, 2014). This is observable in the structure of the New Urban Agenda which formed part of the SDGs pertaining to cities and has been shaped by a bottom-up process marked by diverse participation including communities, experts and activists, rather than the top-down variant that is observable in the Millenium Development Goals (Barnett and Parnell, 2016). This approach could also be evidenced in the Paris Agreement, which placed the onus of a successful global governance regime on the development of efficient systems of regional governance. However, these emerging systems of regional governance could equally pose a challenge to the global governance in a way that can be witnessed through the development of financial groups such as the BRICS (associated economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which resulted from a perception of inadequate institutional transformation at the global level. From another perspective, a comprehensive approach would require simultaneous implementation of both bottom-up and top-down models of governance, retaining flexibility of scale.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.15" top="378.64"><span x0="306.57" y0="378.64" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.38; y0: 378.64; y1: 388.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Given the concerns surrounding food security, especially in light of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, under the NDCs submitted by South Asian nations under the Paris Agreement, emission reduction commitments are </span><span style="x0: 407.23; x1: 409.34; y0: 342.64; y1: 352.14; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="407.23" y0="342.64" x1="443.27">less likely </span><span x0="443.12" y0="342.64" x1="560.16" style="x0: 443.12; x1: 445.93; y0: 342.64; y1: 352.14; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to include the agriculture sector. Prospects for enhancing both adaptive capacity and food security could be improved by strengthening resilience and profitability through the introduction of a basket of policy choices and actions including structural reforms, agriculture value-chain interventions and landscape-level efforts for climate resilience. Correspondingly, the substantial adaptation finance gap could be closed with the help of both private finance (autonomous adaptation) and international financial transfers (Amjath-Babu et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.15" top="222.66"><span x0="306.57" y0="222.66" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.61; y0: 222.66; y1: 232.16; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">For nearly five decades, integrated coastal management (ICM), advocated by several international organisations (e.g., IMO, UNEP, WHO, FAO) and adopted by over 100&#160;countries, has been acknowledged as a holistic coastal governance approach aimed at achieving coastal sustainability and reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities in the face of multiple environmental impacts (</span><span style="x0: 484.43; x1: 489.01; y0: 162.66; y1: 172.16; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="484.43" y0="162.66" x1="542.8">high confidence</span><span x0="542.8" y0="162.66" x1="560.17" style="x0: 542.8; x1: 545.44; y0: 162.66; y1: 172.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). In view of threats posed to coastal ecological integrity by climate-change-induced tropical storm activity, accelerated SLR and littoral erosion and social&#8211;ecological impacts on the livelihood security of vulnerable coastal communities, the pressing need for approaches that innovatively combine coastal zone management and CCA measures is widely acknowledged (Rosendo et&#160;al., 2018) yet under researched. A study focusing on the three coastal cities of Xiamen, Quanzhou and Dongying, in China, a country with nearly 12% of its national coastline already covered under the ICM governance framework, suggests that </span></div></body></html>
