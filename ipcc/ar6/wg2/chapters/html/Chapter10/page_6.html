It can be broadly divided into six sub-regions based on geographic position and coastal peripheries (IPCC, 2014b). These are, in alphabetical order, Central Asia (5&#160;countries), East Asia (7&#160;countries/regions), North Asia (2&#160;countries), South Asia (8&#160;countries), Southeast Asia (12&#160;countries) and West Asia (17&#160;countries). The population of Asia was reported to be over 4.46&#160;billion in 2016, which is about 60% of the world&#8217;s population with an estimated density of 100 people per square kilometre (UNDESA, 2017). The highest life expectancy at birth is 84&#160;years (Japan) and the lowest is 52&#160;years (Afghanistan) (CIA, 2017). The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranged from US$587 (Afghanistan) to US$81,585 (Macao, SAR, PRC) (IMF, 2018).</span></div><div left="56.55" right="252.1" top="533.98"><span style="x0: 56.55; x1: 63.22; y0: 533.98; y1: 545.98; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.55" y0="533.98" x1="252.1">Box&#160;10.1 | What Is New on Asia in AR6?</span></div><div left="56.55" right="63.77" top="510.6"><span style="x0: 56.55; x1: 61.3; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.55" y0="510.6" x1="63.77">&#8226; </span><span x0="70.73" y0="510.6" x1="281.92" style="x0: 70.73; x1: 76.18; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation in energy sector is becoming increasingly crucial in the Asian region, which has been assessed in a new subsection.</span><span style="x0: 56.55; x1: 61.3; y0: 474.61; y1: 484.11; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.55" y0="474.61" x1="63.77">&#8226; </span><span x0="70.73" y0="474.61" x1="281.92" style="x0: 70.73; x1: 76.18; y0: 474.61; y1: 484.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation technology and innovations are also of high importance for the region.

The projected rise could lead to large-scale flooding in low-lying areas, particularly South, Southeast and East Asia.&#8226; The erosion of the major deltas of Asia may take place through a rise in sea levels, an increased frequency of extreme weather events and the excessive withdrawal of groundwater.&#8226; The priority areas for Asia include an enhancement of capabilities to collect social and biophysical data, information sharing, sectoral interactions, a mainstreaming of science and the identification of critical climate thresholds across regions and sectors.</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.26" top="558.65"><span x0="306.56" y0="558.65" x1="560.26" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 312.02; y0: 558.65; y1: 568.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Drawing upon a greater number of studies made possible by greater use of advanced research tools, such as remote sensing as well as meticulous modelling of impacts, the Fifth Assessment Report could significantly expand its coverage of pertinent issues (IPCC, 2014c). For example, the discussion on the Himalayas was expanded to cover observed and projected impacts of climate change on tourism (WGII AR5 Section&#160;10.6.2); livelihood assets such as water and food (WGII AR5 Sections&#160;9.3.3.1, 13.3.1.1, 18.5.3, 19.6.3); poverty (WGII AR5 Section&#160;13.3.2.3); culture (WGII AR5 Section&#160;12.3.2); flood risks (WGII AR5 Sections&#160;18.3.1.1, 24.2.1); health risks (WGII AR5 Section&#160;24.4.6.2); and ecosystems (WGII AR5 Section&#160;24.4.2.2; IPCC, 2014b, 2014c).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.27" top="402.67"><span x0="306.56" y0="402.67" x1="560.27" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.31; y0: 402.67; y1: 412.17; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">&#8226; Over the past century, and across most of Asia, warming trends and increasing temperature extremes have been observed.&#8226; Adequate supplies of freshwater resources are under considerable threat due to both the existing pattern of socioeconomic growth and climate change.&#8226; With a number of regions already close to the heat stress limits, most models, using a range of general circulation models (GCMs) and Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios, suggest that higher temperatures will lead to shorter growing periods of rice cultivation, resulting in lower rice yields.&#8226; Climate-change impacts have led to visible shifts on the terrestrial systems in many parts of Asia in the phenologies, growth rates and distributions of plant species.&#8226; Coastal and marine systems in Asia are under increasing stress from both climate-impact drivers (CIDs) and non-climate drivers, and mean SLR will contribute to upwards trends in extreme coastal high water levels (WGI AR5 Section&#160;3.7.6) (Rhein, et&#160;al., 2013). Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds may decline unless they can move inland, while coastal freshwater swamps and marshes will be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion with rising sea levels. Damage to coral reefs will increase during the 21st century because of both warming and ocean acidification.&#8226; Climate change will further compound multiple stresses caused due to rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic growth. Development of sustainable cities in Asia with fewer fossil-fuel-driven vehicles and with more trees and greenery would have a number of co-benefits, including improved public health.&#8226; Extreme climate events will have an increasing impact on human health, security, livelihoods and poverty, with the type and magnitude of impact varying across Asia.</span></div></body></html>
