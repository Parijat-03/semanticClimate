<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" content-type="flushleft">Earth&#8217;s biosphere, its extraordinary and complex web of species and ecosystems on land and in the oceans, drives the life-sustaining cycles of water and other materials that enable all life on Earth to thrive. The biosphere is also a principal driver of immense negative feedback loops in the Earth system that stabilize atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and thereby global climate&#8212;including carbon sequestration by vegetation, soils, and the oceans. As such, Earth&#8217;s ecosystems have played a central role in keeping our planet&#8217;s climate system unusually stable throughout the last 11,700 years (i.e., the inter-glacial Holocene). During this epoch, global mean temperatures have oscillated only about 1 &#176;C around the pre-industrial average, providing the unique conditions that allowed human civilizations to flourish. Today, ocean and land ecosystems remove around 50% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the atmosphere each year (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), an extraordinary biophysical feat, given that these emissions have risen from approximately 4 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) per year in 1960 to around 11 GtC per year today. Put another way, half our &#8220;climate debt&#8221; is removed, for free, by the biosphere every year&#8212;a vast subsidy to the world economy.</p>
