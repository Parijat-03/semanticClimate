Finally, social and health services work directly to ameliorate the negative health effects of climate change. For example, in Barcelona, during heat waves these services are responsible for, among other things, issuing the advice to be followed by citizens and identifying people whose health is at greatest risk (frail, elderly people, those taking certain medications, homeless people, etc.). These activities should be included in the planning of social and health services to guarantee their resilience.</p>
