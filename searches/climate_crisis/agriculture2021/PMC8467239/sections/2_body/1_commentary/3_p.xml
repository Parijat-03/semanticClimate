With the arrival of COVID-19, Afghanistan&#8217;s situation was further exacerbated. The sudden onset of the pandemic was a major factor in aggravating acute food insecurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As one of the world&#8217;s hunger hotspots, there is a need for continuous flow and increased assistance to curb the increasing trend in the incidence of famine. To create data and provide some statistics, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) researched food insecurity amid COVID-19 in Afghanistan. In September 2020, 11.15 million people were reported to be in high level of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or more) with 3.6 million being in the Emergency phase (IPC Phase 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These results represented a 3% increase from the numbers obtained the previous year during the same period showing the worsening situation.</p>
