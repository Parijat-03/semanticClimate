As Bhaskar indicated in his review [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], long- and short-term exposures to air pollutants induce oxidative stress and decrease cellular immunity and chemical response. Additionally, the expression of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, which is involved in the virus&#8217;s entry into lung cells, is associated with chronic exposure to air pollutants [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
