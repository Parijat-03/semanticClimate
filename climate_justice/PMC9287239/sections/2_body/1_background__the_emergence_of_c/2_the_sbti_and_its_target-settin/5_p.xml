While companies are free to choose their base year, SBTi recommends the use of the latest year for which data without an atypical emission profile are available. In general, companies should express SBTs as percentage reduction in absolute emissions or emission intensities (e.g., per ton of product or $ of revenue). For scope 2, SBTi also permits targeting increased procurement of renewable electricity<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref>. Scope 3 engagement targets involve targeting a percentage of suppliers and customers (by scope 3 emissions or procurement spend) with SBTs.</p>
