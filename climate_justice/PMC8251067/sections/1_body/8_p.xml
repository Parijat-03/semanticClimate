<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Climate activism has contributed to a research&#8208;based majority consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change, but it has not convinced me that the climate apocalypse can be averted politically. On the other hand, the new Corona virus has taught us that anything that seriously impairs the operation of the global economy &#8211; whether a pandemic, financial collapse or a natural disaster &#8211; <italic>could</italic> effectively avert climate apocalypse. While climate activists and proponents of degrowth affirm that the current global response to the pandemic is <italic>not</italic> a welcome development from their perspectives, they seriously need to consider the possibility that these may be the only kind of conditions that might make their visions materialise. Although at this point the prospects for a post&#8208;carbon future seem remote, we have not yet seen the end of what a pandemic might accomplish.</p>
