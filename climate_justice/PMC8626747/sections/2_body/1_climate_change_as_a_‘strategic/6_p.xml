(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2019</xref>) point out that in its 12th Five-Year Plan, China introduces a &#8216;normal new era of development&#8217;, characterized by changes in its industrial structure and emphasis on the quality of growth that should be sustainable and environmentally friendly. We observe this trend also in the case of the historical problem of European energy security, and in investments&#8212;both public and private&#8212;in the alternative energy sector. Such investments are associated with economic advantages resulting from less external dependence on energy and greater cumulative potential to compete in global sustainable energy markets. According to Romano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>), the promotion of environmental sustainability, in particular the fight against climate change, endorsed the competitiveness of the European economy in relation to other markets. Present environmental protection under the cloak of pro-climate policies has given strategic interests a more political dimension; in addition, it has also helped solving issues of cost structure and resource scarcity. The coexistence of the EU&#8217;s strategic political-economic interests, the demands of an engaged scientific community and an active civil society were crucial elements for constructing social support inside and moving the European climate policy beyond its borders (Pavese and Torney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>).</p>
