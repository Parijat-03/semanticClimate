<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Eco-centric concepts now extend to &#8220;wild property law&#8221;, ascribing personhood to &#8220;Eco-entities&#8221; in law, and laws of &#8220;Ecocide&#8221;. The French government is the first country to pass a law of Ecocide (2020) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Despite some commentators saying this is a diluted form of the citizens&#8217; convention recommendation, this is another indicator of the increasingly eco-centric orientation of recent legal developments. As legal developments are stimulated by this normative shift towards eco-centricity, a growing focus for public health stakeholders will pertain to the incorporation of a public health mandate into this new eco-centric legal paradigm. Will eco-centric laws be grounded in the One Health model [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] championed by environmental health practitioners and others? Will they respond to our need to reconcile goals of societal development, public health, and ecological preservation? It is these questions at the intersection of law and public health which will be important to address in future interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
