A few scholars have documented rifts <italic>within</italic> environmental justice movements, such as debates over what should be the scale of anti-hazardous waste activism in Alabama (Alley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1995</xref>) or the implications of race and class as bases of identification in social movement organizing in South Africa (Checker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). How the empirical reality of climate change can add a dimension of difference within environmental justice movements, manifesting as a rift of temporal scale, is comparatively overlooked.</p>
