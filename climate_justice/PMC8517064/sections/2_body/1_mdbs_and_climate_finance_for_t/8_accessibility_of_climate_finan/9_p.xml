(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>) found that only 7% of the financing for adaptation in small-scale agriculture targeted value chain actors, including agri-enterprises and SMEs. Even less (3%) was directed towards formal financial institutions (Chiriac et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). However, many of the barriers to adaptation in the small-scale agricultural sector are commercial in nature &#8211; e.g. lack of agri-business development, low and risky financial returns discouraging engagement of private sector lending and investment risks due to lack of information. This suggests that people operating agri-enterprises and SMEs face severely constrained access to climate finance. (Chiriac et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>).</p>
