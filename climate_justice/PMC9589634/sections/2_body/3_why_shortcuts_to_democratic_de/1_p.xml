He analyzes and describes the tendency of an <italic>epistemicization of the political</italic> as the idea that reasonable and responsible politics is possible solely on the basis of superior scientific knowledge (Bogner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>, p. 114). In practice, this idea is reflected in an expertocratization of politics that bypasses broad and democratic procedures of will-formation by transferring decisions to specialized bodies. From this perspective, crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic or climate change are understood primarily as epistemic problems. It is undeniable that dealing with such crises requires a particular level of specialized knowledge and thus comprehensive scientific policy advice. However, the assumption that experts can therefore also make better political decisions is misguided in several ways.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref></p>
