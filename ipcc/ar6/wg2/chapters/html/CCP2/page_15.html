Financial arrangements for coastal adaptation measures that align public-actor and private-investor interests are suitable for a range of budgets, from USD&#160;10,000 to 100&#160;million (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018). Private equity instruments that involve real estate development companies have already been successfully implemented and are most effective in urban areas with high-value real estate development (Chiang and Ling, 2017). Public&#8211;private partnership equity instruments that engage construction and real estate developers have been successful for small- to medium-scale infrastructural projects. While public&#8211;private partnership bonds and public bonds have the potential to align public actors and private investors, such instruments require de-risking of coastal adaptation through enabling economic policy instruments, such as concessional loans (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.73" top="462.63"><span x0="54.0" y0="462.63" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.4; y0: 462.63; y1: 472.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Explicitly identifying the benefits, or goods and services, that are provided by coastal adaptation is critical to supplement limited government funds and engage a broader set of financial tools and actors (Woodruff et&#160;al., 2020). Matching goods and services provided by particular adaptation strategies to specific beneficiaries helps to identify the range of fair and equitable financial tools. In the Netherlands, public fundings through state, regional and local entities have independent tax revenue systems to provide the funding needed to maintain flooding infrastructure (Hinkel et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.72" top="342.65"><span x0="54.0" y0="342.65" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 59.81; y0: 342.65; y1: 352.15; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Given the high costs of coastal adaptation, benefit-to-cost ratios (BCR) are often used to determine the value of investing in adaptation. BCR are high for urbanised coastal areas with high concentrations of assets (13% of the world&#8217;s coastline), covering 90% of the global coastal floodplain population and 96% of assets in the global coastal floodplain (Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). A global assessment shows a&#160;BCR for investing in flood protection of up to ~120 (Tiggeloven et&#160;al., 2020). For Europe, at least 83% of flood damages could be avoided by elevating dikes along ~23&#8211;32% of Europe&#8217;s coastline and BCR vary from 8.3 to 14.9, with higher ratios for higher concentration pathways (Section&#160;13.2; Vousdoukas et&#160;al., 2020a). Globally, 40% of damages can be reduced with levees of 1 m and costs lower than avoided damage (Tamura et&#160;al., 2019). For a mix of expensive storm surge barriers, nature-based solutions and flood-proofing measures for New York City, Aerts et&#160;al. (2014) found BCRs &lt;1 for the current situation, but &gt;2 for a SLR scenario of +1 m.</span></div><div left="54.0" right="307.73" top="138.67"><span x0="54.0" y0="138.67" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 59.45; y0: 138.67; y1: 148.17; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">However, BCR values may be low and adaptation investment may not be financially viable for small coastal settlements, less densely populated poorer coasts or isolated communities </span><span style="x0: 228.13; x1: 230.78; y0: 114.68; y1: 124.18; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: DGKZFC+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="228.13" y0="114.68" x1="307.73">(medium confidence). </span><span x0="54.0" y0="102.68" x1="307.74" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 59.1; y0: 102.68; y1: 112.18; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Considering BCRs of protection and coastal migration across a range of SLR and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios for the 21st century, a higher BCR was found for protection of only 3% of the global coastline protecting 78% of the coastal population and 92% of global coastal floodplain assets, while for the remaining coasts, coastal </span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.89" top="714.69"><span x0="318.19" y0="714.69" x1="571.89" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 320.83; y0: 714.69; y1: 724.19; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(Lincke and Hinkel, 2021). Considering coastal migration as part of the solution space could lower global costs in investment and maintenance for SLR protection by a factor of 2&#8211;4 in the 21st century, but would result in large land losses and high levels of migration for South and Southeast Asia in particular, and in relative terms, small island nations would suffer most. The need to consider place attachment, community relationships, livelihoods and the spiritual and cultural significance of settlements limits the application of BCR as a tool for coastal adaptation decisions in these contexts (Thomas and Benjamin, 2020). Moreover, there is limited knowledge on trade-offs, including BCR, of alternative adaptation options and pathways at a global to regional scale, in particular over the long term (beyond 2100).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.9" top="558.71"><span x0="318.19" y0="558.71" x1="571.9" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 322.58; y0: 558.71; y1: 568.21; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Even where BCR is high, finance may be inaccessible, as it is challenging to convert the long-term benefits of adaptation into the revenue streams that may be needed to initially finance adaptation investments (Hinkel et&#160;al., 2018). For example, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, despite high BCR, high costs of flood protection (USD&#160;1.4&#8211;2.6&#160;billion) have prevented such adaptation measures from being implemented (Hinkel et&#160;al., 2018; Cao et&#160;al., 2021). Moreover, drawing from places as distinct as small communities in Fiji (Neef et&#160;al., 2018) and Belize (Karlsson and Hovelsrud, 2015), and megacities like New York City and Shanghai (Oppenheimer et&#160;al., 2019), BCR provides only a limited view and consideration of feasibility, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, culture, politics and power, and attachment to place has a greater chance of fostering CRD (</span><span style="x0: 437.77; x1: 442.35; y0: 414.73; y1: 424.23; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: DGKZFC+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="437.77" y0="414.73" x1="494.77">high confidence</span><span x0="494.77" y0="414.73" x1="499.69" style="x0: 494.77; x1: 497.41; y0: 414.73; y1: 424.23; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).</span></div><div left="318.19" right="419.03" top="378.48"><span style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.75; y0: 378.48; y1: 388.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: QIIWJC+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.19" y0="378.48" x1="419.03">CCP2.4.3 Governance</span></div><div left="318.19" right="571.91" top="354.6"><span x0="318.19" y0="354.6" x1="571.91" style="x0: 318.19; x1: 323.64; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An array of climatic and non-climatic perils (Le Cozannet et&#160;al., 2017) present coastal communities and their governing authorities with immense governance and institutional challenges that will become progressively more difficult as sea level rises (</span><span style="x0: 507.18; x1: 511.76; y0: 318.61; y1: 328.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: DGKZFC+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="507.18" y0="318.61" x1="567.73">high confidence</span><span x0="567.73" y0="318.61" x1="571.93" style="x0: 567.73; x1: 570.01; y0: 318.61; y1: 328.11; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">; Wallace, 2017; Leal Filho et&#160;al., 2018; Oppenheimer et&#160;al., 2019). Yet a study of public provisions for coastal adaptation in 136&#160;of the largest coastal port&#8211;urban agglomerations across 68&#160;countries found no policy implementation in 50% of the cases; in 85% of cases, adaptation actions are not framed by current impacts or future risks, and formal efforts are recent and concentrated in more developed settings (Olazabal et&#160;al., 2019; Olazabal and Ruiz De Gopegui, 2021), thus underscoring a persistent coastal adaptation gap.
