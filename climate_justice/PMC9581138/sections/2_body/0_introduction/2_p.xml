In fact, a recent study conducted across 125 European-based projects found the roles citizen scientists undertook in the projects were predominantly those of collaborators (Moczek et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Such approaches are increasingly chosen when attention is required from both local actors and communities in order to solve place-based problems and deliver community outcomes (Gunnell et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Manzoni et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>
