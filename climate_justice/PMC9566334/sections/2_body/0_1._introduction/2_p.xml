<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This study examines the spatial-temporal aspects of urban heat exposure within the top 200 most populous cities in the US. The analysis is performed at the census tract-level across all cities and for each city as a whole. Utilizing measurements of the SUHI from 2003 to 2018 and applying a Bayesian hierarchical spatial temporal modelling approach, enables the examination of SUHI intensity measurements relative to US Decadal Census data, quantifying the predominant racial composition of census tracts and the level of segregation in the respective city. Tracts are stratified into the prevalence of the population-based groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian. This methodology allows for the determination of the temporal trends in heat exposure in affected areas based on demographic prevalence. Moreover, it will foster a more complete understanding of the disparity in thermal exposure through time and hopefully, catalyze efforts to improve local environments in affected areas and promote social, climatic and environmental justice. This study should add further weight and urgency to similarly inclined environmental justice pursuits especially related to heat health risk and the inequitable distribution of environmental health hazards.</p>
