He wonders why the globally spreading Covid&#8208;19 virus has been quicker in making inroads in reducing emissions and protecting ecosystems. Kevin M. DeLuca explores the role of image events in ecological activism in the age of globalisation and new media. He asks to what extent contemporary climate protest movements are able to challenge techno&#8208;industrial capitalism, as their ways to act are based on the resources of this very system. Similarly, Sarah Vaughn sees in climate activism the potential to tell stories about connections between the local and planetary effects of climate change. Since these stories exist on the fringe of dominant discourses, ethnography can help highlighting these connections.</p>
