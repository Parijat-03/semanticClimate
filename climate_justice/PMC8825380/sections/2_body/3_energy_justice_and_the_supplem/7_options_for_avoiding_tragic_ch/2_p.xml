Viewed inter-generationally, the CA supplemented with ceilings recommends such a choice. Since energy demands are primarily fulfilled through the burning of fossil fuels, then both avoiding climate change and ensuring (or at the very least raising the likelihood) that future generations get what is required by justice would entail substantial restrictions on current and near-term emissions of fossil fuels. Given the close relation between HDI and energy use per capita, this likely means that a great share of the current generations are not provided what is required by justice. This would be a tragic choice wherein future generations can be pushed up to the threshold at the expense of members of current generations.</p>
