cases: (1) can be adjusted for different types and levels of health
professionals, (2) can be modified to educate health professionals regarding how
to approach patients with varying levels of climate change knowledge and belief,
(3) can be shifted to benefit the specific geographic region and culture of the
population affected, and (4) the cases can be recorded and used for future
training sessions.<sup>
