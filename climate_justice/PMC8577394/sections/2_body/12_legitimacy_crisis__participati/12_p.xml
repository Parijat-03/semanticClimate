In contrast to the experience of participating in the design phase of the project, people providing input in workshops and public hearings now could not see their input reflected in the evolution of the plans. At each meeting, city officials would repeat their technical justification of the new plan. They would continue to gather feedback, but this feedback rarely if ever made it into the plan. Participants perceived that their involvement was now without influence and it frustrated them. City officials, on the other hand, insisted that the process remained participatory, since residents continued to attend and provide feedback in city-organized hearings and meetings. Political legitimacy in the ESCR, then, came from residents participating in the process recognizing their own input in plans, rather than outside actors &#8211; such as city staff or researchers &#8211; imposing their evaluation of whether the participation process was meaningful or not. This understanding of influence is distinct from Arnstein&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1969</xref>) classic conceptualization of meaningful participation as an objective quality that exists outside the experience of participants involved in a planning process.</p>
