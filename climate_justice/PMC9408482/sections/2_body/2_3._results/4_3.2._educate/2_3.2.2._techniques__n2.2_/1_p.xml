They need skills and training for their staff and stakeholders to enable them to carry out technical assessments and operations related to NDC implementation (Benin, Uganda, and Burundi). They need technical assistance in different sectors (N5.3). For instance, Burundi, Rwanda, Lao DPR, and Liberia referred to climate risk screening, early warning systems, and procedural matters related to planning, budgeting, and administration of gaining climate finance (N1.1). The procedures involved in applying for grants (N1.1, N1.3), etc., and the identification of climate action needs and &#8220;differentiated&#8221; (PA) action plans depend upon international technical assistance. Bhutan needs techniques for robust forest monitoring; Burundi needs to learn the technical processes involved in the sustainable production of new crops; Myanmar requires assistance in identifying their country&#8217;s needs (N2.3).</p>
