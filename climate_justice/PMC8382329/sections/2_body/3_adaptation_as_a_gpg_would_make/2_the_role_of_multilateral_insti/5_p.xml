For example, UNDP initiated the human development index and the norm of human security in the mid-1990s. As &#8220;knowledge brokers,&#8221; multilateral organizations may circumvent the principal-agent relationship, and influence state behavior. Kaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017c</xref>) advocates for a stronger role of MDBs for the provision of GPGs, suggesting that the MDBs could keep funds dedicated for GPG-related purposes separate from funds for national projects. She also suggested the creation of a separate institution like the OECD-DAC to handle GPG fund mobilization.</p>
