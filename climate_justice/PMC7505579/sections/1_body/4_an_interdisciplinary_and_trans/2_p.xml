<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0155">Co-producing knowledge is a challenging task that must be carried out from both an interdisciplinary (across different disciplines) and a transdisciplinary (cross-actoral and cross-sectoral) lens. These are widely used in addressing the current tranformations in the relations between research, economy and society. Interdisciplinarity is a mode of research that integrates data, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from multiple disciplines to advance fundamental understanding or to find solutions beyond the scope of a single discipline <xref rid="b0865" ref-type="bibr">[173]</xref>; while transdisciplinarity is a reflexive, mutual learning, method-driven scientific principle <xref rid="b0870" ref-type="bibr">[174]</xref>, that aims at solving societal problems characterised by complexity and diversity. It does so by differentiating and integrating various bodies of knowledge and inputs <xref rid="b0875" ref-type="bibr">[175]</xref> from a wide range of stakeholders <xref rid="b0880" ref-type="bibr">[176]</xref>, <xref rid="b0885" ref-type="bibr">[177]</xref>, like community, practitioners, and indigenous perspectives <xref rid="b0890" ref-type="bibr">[178]</xref>. In this context, co-production entails a collaborative process of knowledge production, which uses integration as a means to combine scientific and local/traditional bodies of knowledge contributing to a holistic understanding <xref rid="b0895" ref-type="bibr">[179]</xref>.</p>
