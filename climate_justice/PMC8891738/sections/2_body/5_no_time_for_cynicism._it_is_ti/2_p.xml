The US&#8217;s 4-year absence from the climate negotiations stage left a void yet to be filled. There is plenty that the world leaders and policymakers, and international organizations should learn from young men and women advocating for climate action not only because they are accountable to them as voters and future torchbearers. However, they should always aim for an honest conversation rather than tokenism and display similar character and courage needed in the climate negotiations.</p>
