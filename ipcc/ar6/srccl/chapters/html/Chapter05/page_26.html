Negative impacts may be exacerbated if irrigation water availability declines due to climate change and increased water demand in upstream regions. In Iran, changes in rainfall and water endowments are projected to significantly impact crop yield and water requirements, as well as income and welfare of farm families (Karimi et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="615.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 615.12; y1: 624.62; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="615.12" x1="307.55">Climate change impacts on food, feed and cash crops other than cereals, often grown in smallholder systems or family farms are less often studied, although impacts can be substantial.

Where crop production will become marginal, livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. Such transitions could occur in up to&#160;3% of the total area of Africa, largely as a&#160;result of increases in the probability of season failure in the drier mixed crop&#8211;livestock systems of the continent (Thornton et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="423.14"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 423.14; y1: 432.64; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="423.14" x1="307.55">In Mexico, subsistence agriculture is expected to be the most vulnerable to climate change, due to its intermittent production and reliance on maize and beans (Monterroso et al. 2014).

This would impact consumers globally through higher food prices, though regional effects will vary. The median cereal price increase was&#160;7%, given current projections of demand. In all cases (across SSPs and global economic models), prices are projected to increase for rice and coarse grains, with only one instance of a&#160;price decline&#160;(&#8211;1%) observed for wheat in SSP1, with price increases projected in all other cases. Animal-sourced foods (ASFs) are also projected to see price increases (1%), but the range of projected price changes are about half those of cereals, highlighting that the climate impacts on ASFs will be felt indirectly, through the cost and availability of feed, and that there is significant scope for feed substitution within the livestock sector. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="507.14"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 507.14; y1: 516.64; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="507.14" x1="566.11">Declining food availability caused by climate change is likely to lead to increasing food cost impacting consumers globally through higher prices and reduced purchasing power, with low-income consumers particularly at risk from higher food prices (Nelson et al. 2010; Springmann et al. 2016a and Nelson et al. 2018). Higher prices depress consumer demand, which in turn will not only reduce energy intake (calories) globally (Hasegawa et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2010; Springmann et al. 2016a and Hasegawa et al. 2018), but will also likely lead to less healthy diets with lower availability of key micronutrients (Nelson et al. 2018) and increase diet-related mortality in lower and middle-income countries (Springmann et al. 2016a).

Not all regions will respond to climate impacts equally, with more uncertainty on regional land-use change across the model ensemble than the global totals might suggest. For example, the median land-use change for Latin America is an increase of cropland by&#160;3%, but the range across the model ensemble is significant, with three models projecting declines in cropland&#160;(&#8211;25 to &#8211;1%) compared </span></div></body></html>
