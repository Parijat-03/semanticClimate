Cryosphere changes in high mountain areas have in&#64258;uenced human mobility and migration during this century by altering water availability and increasing exposure to mass movements and &#64258;oods and other cryospheric induced disasters (Figure&#160;2.7) (Barnett et al., 2005; Carey et al., 2017; Rasul and Molden, 2019). These changes affect three forms of human mobility: transhumant pastoralism, temporary or permanent wage labour migration and displacement, in which entire communities resettle in new areas.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="447.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 447.54; y1: 457.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="447.54" x1="307.57">Transhumant pastoralism, involving movements between summer and winter pastures, is a centuries old practice in high mountain areas (Lozny, 2013). In High Mountain Asia and other regions, it is declining due to both climatic factors, including changes in snow distribution and glaciers, and to non-climatic factors, and is projected to continue declining, at least in the short term (</span><span style="x0: 239.84; x1: 246.7; y0: 387.55; y1: 397.05; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="239.84" y0="387.55" x1="307.55">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 116.71; x1: 119.35; y0: 375.55; y1: 385.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="116.71" y0="375.55" x1="307.57">). The changes in snow and glaciers adversely affect herders at their summer residences and winter camps in the Himalaya (Namgay et al., 2014) and in Scandinavian mountains (Mallory and Boyce, 2018). Reduced winter snowfall has led to poorer pasture quality in Nepal (Gentle and Maraseni, 2012) and India (Ingty, 2017). Other climate change impacts, including erratic snowfall patterns and a decrease in rainfall, are perceived by herders in Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to have resulted in vegetation of lower quality and quantity (Shaoliang et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2013; Gentle and Thwaites, 2016). Heavy snowfall incidents in winter caused deaths of a large number of livestock in northern Pakistan in 2009 (Shaoliang et al., 2012). Herders in Nepal reported of water scarcity in traditional water sources along migration routes (Gentle and Thwaites, 2016). Increased glacier melt water has caused lakes on the Tibetan Plateau to increase in size, covering pasture areas and leading pastoralists to alter their patterns of seasonal movement (Nyima and Hopping, 2019). However, rising temperatures, with associated effects on snow cover, have some positive impacts. Seasonal migration from winter to summer pastures start earlier in Northern Pakistan, and residence in summer pasture lasts longer (Joshi et al., 2013), as it does in Afghanistan (Shaoliang et al., 2012).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.54" top="111.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 67.09; y0: 111.58; y1: 121.08; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="111.58" x1="307.54">Wage labour migration is also a centuries old practice in the Himalaya, the Andes and the European Alps (Macfarlane, 1976; Cole, 1985; Viazzo, 1989).

Wage labour migration linked to cryosphere changes occurs on several time scales, including short-term, long-term and permanent migration, and on different spatial scales. Though migration usually takes place within the country of origin, and sometimes within the region, cases of international migration have also been recorded (Merrey et al., 2018). The studies since AR5 on migration driven by cryosphere changes are concentrated in High Mountain Asia and the Andes, supporting the &#64257;nding, reported in AR5 Working Group II (Section&#160;12.7), that stress on livelihoods is an important driver of climate change induced migration. The research on such migration also supports the &#64257;nding in SR15 (Section&#160;4.3.5.6) that migration can have mixed outcomes on reducing socioeconomic vulnerability, since cases of increase and of reduction of vulnerability are both found in migration from high mountain regions that is driven by cryosphere changes. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="531.62"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 531.62; y1: 541.12; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="531.62" x1="566.09">Changing water availability, mass movements and &#64258;oods are cryosphere processes which drive wage labour migration (</span><span style="x0: 534.62; x1: 541.48; y0: 519.62; y1: 529.12; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="534.62" y0="519.62" x1="566.1">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 410.33; x1: 412.98; y0: 507.62; y1: 517.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="410.33" y0="507.62" x1="566.1">). A debris &#64258;ow in central Nepal in 2014, in a region where landslides have increased in recent decades, led more than half the households to migrate for months (van der Geest and Schindler, 2016). In the Santa River drainage, Peru, rural populations have declined 10% between 1970&#8211;2000, and the area of several major subsistence crops also declined (Bury et al., 2013). Research in this region suggests that seasonal wage labour migration from small basins within the main Santa basin is largest in the small drainages in which glacier retreat has reduced melt water &#64258;ow most signi&#64257;cantly; where this process is not as acute, and stream&#64258;ow is less reduced, migration rates are lower  (Wrathall et al., 2014). A study from a region in the central Peruvian Andes shows that the residents of the villages that have the highest dependence on glacier melt water travel further and stay away longer than the residents of the villages where glacier melt water forms a smaller portion of stream &#64258;ow (Milan and Ho, 2014). However, the inverse relation between reliance on cryosphere-related water sources and migration was noted in a case in the Naryn River drainage in Kyrgyzstan, where the villages that are more dependent on glacier melt water had lower, rather than higher, rates of wage labour migration than the villages which were less dependent on it; the villages with lower rates of such migration also had more ef&#64257;cient water management institutions than the others (Hill et al., 2017). Several studies, which project cryosphere-related emigration to continue in the short term, emphasise decreased water availability, due to glacier retreat as a driver in Kyrgyzstan (Chandonnet et al., 2016) and Peru (Oliver-Smith, 2014), and to reduced snow cover in Nepal (Prasain, 2018). In most cases, climate is only one of several drivers (employment opportunities and better educational and health services in lowland areas are others).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="147.67"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 147.67; y1: 157.17; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="147.67" x1="566.1">Several studies show that wage labour migration is more frequent among young adults than among other age groups, supporting the observation in AR5 that climate change migrants worldwide are concentrated in this age (</span><span style="x0: 416.85; x1: 418.96; y0: 111.67; y1: 121.17; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="416.85" y0="111.67" x1="541.62">limited evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 541.61; x1: 544.26; y0: 111.67; y1: 121.17; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="541.61" y0="111.67" x1="566.09">).
