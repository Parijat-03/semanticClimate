From a Gramscian perspective, we have illustrated contradictions through the lenses of both players&#8217; bilateral relations with Brazil. The maintenance of commercial flows, the access to markets and primary products and the strategic internationalization of both economies&#8212;Chinese and European&#8212;are today contradictory with their promotion of climate justice norms. Considering that this is an on-going research agenda, we have highlighted how states&#8217; bilateral relations may contribute to deepen inequalities, steer human rights violations and harm local&#8211;global climate, exactly the opposite of what both players claim to promote multilaterally. In our next steps, we intend to focus primarily on the role of corporations and how they relate to different fractions and sectors within the Brazilian public machinery, thus trying to move beyond a state-centric vision of the EU-Brazil and China-Brazil relations.</p>
