All Diola households try to store African rice as a risk insurance measure against bad harvests, to use in mourning ceremonies, and to conduct rituals at spirits&#8217; shrines. The cereal can be offered or lent to family and neighbors in need, but only the old rice can be sold. Traditionally, Djobel inhabitants accessed other goods, such as cassava, peanuts, palm oil, wine, and clay pots through the direct exchange of rice and fish at weekly Diola markets. However, the growing destruction of rice fields during recent decades has reduced their capacity not only to keep rice stocks but also to be self-sufficient. In the past two decades, income from fish, shrimps, and oysters has started to be used as the main currency to buy rice, other food items, and cloth, and to pay for school expenses. However, according to Djobel inhabitants, income from these activities has been decreasing due to the growth of industrial fishing by foreign countries and the increasing number of people from neighboring villages now engaged in artisanal fishing and oyster collection. As previously noted, most of young people only return during the rainy season for plowing (men) and planting (women), leaving the major work of dike repair and maintenance to the decreasing number that stay in the village.</p>
