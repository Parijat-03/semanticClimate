First, one may not regard all of posterity when discussing the inter-generational aspect. Rather, one can assume that the capabilities either apply only to the people who are currently existing or apply to the immediately subsequent generations. If <italic>all</italic> of posterity is included, that requires considering the capabilities of a set of potentially infinite persons, or at the very least a very high amount. On the other hand, it may be counter-intuitive to restrict capabilities only to those currently existing when the consequences of one&#8217;s choices will not be limited to currently existing individuals. If that were the case, then the storage of nuclear waste, as an example of decisions with long-term consequences, would provide little moral problem; it will most likely affect those existing in the far-off future, not anyone currently existing. Nevertheless, it seems morally questionable to reach such a conclusion.</p>
