The data show that women have strong vested interests in wheat&#8211;maize innovation processes, though the precise form of that interest differs according to locally specific cultural norms which shape their lives as low- and middle-income female farmers and whether they are Santal or Muslim. As a consequence of these differences, the strategies women have developed to access and participate in male-dominated innovation processes differ.</p>
