This is due to low coverage of freshwater lines in these areas and proximity of available lines to waste water sources. Populations living in such settlements are also largely socially and economically disadvantaged and therefore cannot seek to augment or improve their water supply through bureaucratic lobbying. More affluent areas of Delhi, South and Central Delhi for example have better, well-organized water supply as they have the social and economic means to augment their water supply in periods of shortage (summers). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="168.36" top="633.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="633.27" x1="168.36" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 633.27; y1: 645.27; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity</span><span x0="168.38" y0="633.27" x1="526.41" style="x0: 168.38; x1: 171.72; y0: 633.27; y1: 645.27; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: There are currently programs being implemented to improve efficiency of water supply, increased wastewater treatment and methane capture (from sewage treatment plants) as part of the city development plan. These initiatives are aimed at optimizing use of water in Delhi to ensure availability of water for decades to come. The Delhi government has also mandated rainwater harvesting for all constructions of more than 200 sq. yards (GNCTD). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.04" top="541.92"><span x0="72.02" y0="541.92" x1="526.04" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 541.92; y1: 553.92; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are also demand side management practices, aimed at incentivizing conservation of water through awareness initiatives and differential pricing of water across different sectors of Delhi. Water pricing is a major issue currently being addressed by the Indian government. An efficient water pricing mechanism, perhaps managed through public-private partnership would help ensure efficient use of water and curtail wastage (CDP, 2010).</span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.07" top="450.6"><span x0="72.02" y0="450.6" x1="526.07" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 450.6; y1: 462.6; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi government has planned to upgrade treatment facilities that have become highly inefficient. Service level benchmarking initiative of the government of India also requires higher penetration of water supply and sanitation services provided by local bodies. The National Water Mission and National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, aim at optimizing water supply and quality. Climate change may result in reduced water availability and deteriorate water quality. This would disproportionately affect low-income families and informal settlements. The government has planned optimization and improvement of available water supply and treatment services. This is in addition to incentivisation of conservation efforts like rainwater harvesting. The implementation of the above interventions along with demand side management of water is essential for adapting to the above impacts. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="199.97" top="280.87"><span x0="72.02" y0="280.87" x1="199.97" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 280.87; y1: 291.91; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2.4 Urban Planning </span><span x0="72.02" y0="265.27" x1="526.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 265.27; y1: 277.27; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Three urban systems that have been taken into consideration as part of urban planning, these include: (a) Land Use, (b) Infrastructure, and (c) Solid Waste Management. </span></div></body></html>
