Transportation was the second largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitting sector in Australia, and from 1990 to 2017, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to this sector increased from 62 to 98 MT (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Additionally, transportation was the leading sector in terms of energy consumption in the country between 1990 and 2017. As IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) data revealed, energy consumption in the transport sector in Australia rose by 58% from 21,111 to 33,352 ktoe over the studied period. Industry followed transportation in this respect and was the third major determining sector in Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The emissions that resulted from industrial activities decreased slowly from 43 to 38 MT over the period 1990&#8211;2017 (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). In addition, the sector was the second highest energy intensive sector in Australia, immediately after transportation.&#160;The energy consumption of the industry sector increased by 16.4% from 19,320 to 22,476 ktoe in the reviewed period (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p>
