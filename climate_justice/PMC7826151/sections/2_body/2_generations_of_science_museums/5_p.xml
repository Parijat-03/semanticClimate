The corollary to this was the sub-text that these new machines and industrial objects would enhance our well-being and our future. The close association between science and technology was clinched, and with that, the idea that our lives would be better through machines and technological progress.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><italic>Turbine</italic>, Science World, Canada. &#8220;&#8230; What blade angle makes the turbine spin fastest?
