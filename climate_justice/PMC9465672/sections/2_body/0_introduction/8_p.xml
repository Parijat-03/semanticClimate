In a context of state&#8211;society disconnect (Chabal &amp; Green, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>), the islanders' attempt to create a settlement area in the uplands ended up in a conflict over land between Djobel and the neighboring village of Arame (Temudo &amp; Cabral, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2021</xref>), resulting in several deaths and numerous injured people (e.g., REMUME et al.,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>). Despite the many years of claims for help and national television coverage during the 2017 rainy season when there were severe floods and the dike ruptured, no effective technical or financial assistance for climate change mitigation or adaptation measures (see Ministry of Natural Resources &amp; Environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>) has so far been provided either by the state, NGOs, or donors.</p>
