Therefore, we hypothesized that justice is not only the target but also a cause of pro-environmental intention, and, in turn, a motivator of pro-environmental behavior. Hence, we investigated whether justice sensitivity motivates individuals to behave (more) pro-environmentally. In this article, we apply findings from justice sensitivity research to the context of the current climate crisis and investigate the predictive power of justice sensitivity toward the intention of a pro-environmental behavioral change. Moreover, we investigate the associations of pro-environmental behavior change with moral emotions and moral disengagement.</p>
