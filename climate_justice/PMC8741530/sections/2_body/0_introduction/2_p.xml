Global climate justice is an underlying issue and &#8216;unavoidable&#8217; part of international climate politics (Audet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>; Okereke and Coventry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>; Shue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1992</xref>). The failures and successes of international climate negotiations on shaping the design and evolution of the climate regime have much to do with the social construction of climate justice and the idea of a fair climate deal (Audet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). Within the process of constructing a fair global climate deal from Copenhagen to Paris, China&#8217;s role has undergone a significant shift.</p>
