The concept of planetary health is based on the understanding that human health and human civilization depend on flourishing natural systems and the wise stewardship of those natural systems. However, natural systems are being degraded to an extent unprecedented in human history (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2022</xref>). Population health relies on promoting action on the social determinants of health, health security and Universal Health Coverage. Income inequalities affect each of these areas. Worryingly for inequalities (Sustainable Development Goal 10.1), the share of the total income of the bottom 40% has been growing at a slower rate than the income share of the top 10% (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Oldiges and Nayyar, 2022</xref>). Health inequities are a signpost to broader social inequities and their historical legacy, with climate change exacerbating existing health and social inequities. The health sector must adopt a pro-active leadership role in promoting health and drive intersectoral collaboration for lasting solutions to the climate crisis and growing inequities.</p>
