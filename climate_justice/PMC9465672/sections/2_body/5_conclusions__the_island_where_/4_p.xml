Climate change acts in synergy with other human-induced changes, but adaptation measures must incorporate issues of equity and justice (Adger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Borras &amp; Franco, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>), especially when the survival of a population is at risk and social conflicts over land are emerging. Both sudden events and slow-onset processes of climate change can expose poor, marginalized, and underrepresented people to the violation of their human rights, undermine their food, water, and shelter needs, and trigger national or international migration or even a civil war. Thus, the legal protection by both governments and the UN of the rights of climate-related forced migrants is an imperative matter, and a consensus around climate justice mechanisms must be achieved soon.</p>
