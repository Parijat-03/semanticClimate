The main agenda for the Council meetings revolves around the following themes: (1) rapid response to environmental disasters or hazards; (2) sustainability of the digital platform; (3) food and data sovereignty; (4) real-time intervention design for mental wellness; (5) citizen engagement features of the smartphone app; and (6) decision-making dashboard features and functionality. As part of this process, the Council has identified existing and emerging needs to address climate change&#8211;related impacts on community health. In phase 1, we are completing an environmental scan to create an inventory of available resources and programming for food security and sovereignty, solastalgia, and mental wellness, as well as climate change adaptation and preparedness strategies in the community. The findings from this scan will inform digital climate change platform customization.</p>
