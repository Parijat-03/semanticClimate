<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Before building the GTWR models, we first screened all the 25 potential variables for the multicollinearity. For any variables with the Pearson's correlations greater than 0.5 (see the correlation of the covariates in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), we selected one of them to be incorporated into the models based on the information criterion (AICc). We also standardized the dependent and independent variables to directly compare the coefficients in the later GTWR models. We investigated the effects of COVID&#8208;19 outbreaks and wildfires on visits per capita, the median of minimum dwell time at the park, and the travel distance to park separately with three different sets of GTWR models. For each set of GTWR models, we generated all additive possible combination of covariates. All the GTWR models were conducted using the GTWR AddIn in ArcMap 10.8 (Huang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The model performance and predictive accuracy were evaluated based on AICc and global R<sup>2</sup>, respectively. For model selection, the &#8710;AICc for each model were computed as the differences in the AICc values between the lowest AICc and each following model. Any candidate model with &#8710;AICc&#160;&lt;&#160;2 was accounted for as the competing model that informationally indistinguishable (Anderson &amp; Burnham,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The number of covariates incorporated in the competing models and their global <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> were also considered in model selection procedures.</p>
