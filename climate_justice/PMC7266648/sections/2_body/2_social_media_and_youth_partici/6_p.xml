This analysis also strongly correlated reported levels of participation with respondents&#8217; sense of personal political efficacy. This leaves open the real possibility (as the authors identify) that their observations about technology use and political participation may be an expression of some other unmeasured causal agents, or that tool use is epiphenomenal to the connection between political interest and expression that would occur in any other socio-technical setting. Significantly, reflecting our concern about the dominance of individualism, the same volume includes a longitudinal analysis of internet use that concludes that &#8220;&#8230;facilities on the internet often described as &#8216;social&#8217; media offer environments which mainly draw young people&#8217;s attention away from common concerns&#8221; (Ekstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Thus, the actual relationship remains open for investigation, and youth engagement in political participation on the internet is questionable, opening up the potential to explore how the use of social media and other internet-based technologies could mobilise youths into political engagement.</p>
