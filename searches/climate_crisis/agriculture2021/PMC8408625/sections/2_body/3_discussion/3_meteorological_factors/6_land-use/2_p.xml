This is consistent with other literature, according to which humans are particularly at risk in areas close to rice paddies, irrigated agriculture and wetlands, since these areas tend to attract susceptible mosquitoes and birds <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The percentage of discontinuous urban fabric, that represents populated areas of low to medium density that tend to have gardens, parks, ponds, such as residential suburbs and villages <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, is not statistically significant in our model, although it is often cited as a driver of WNV infections in humans.</p>
