One of the many contributors is the four decades of war which has dramatically affected organizations, irrigation, and agricultural infrastructures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Continuing conflict and climate disasters work synergistically, thus burdening the progress in securing food. Natural disasters have contributed hugely to the nutritional status of the country. The arable land is considered to be climate-sensitive for agricultural production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For instance, 70% of natural disasters in Afghanistan were floods, which left the inhabitants without adequate food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Droughts influenced the agricultural infrastructure, thus decreasing nutritional supplies including crops and animal farm produce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies show that there is an inverse correlation between the cost of food and the loss of family income, drought, and food security in Afghanistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
