<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">forcing</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><div><p class="definition" style="font-weight: bold">Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux (expressed in W m2&#160;) at the tropopause or top of atmosphere due to a change in an driver of climate change, such as a&#160;change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun.</p><p>The traditional radiative&#160;forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after&#160;allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium.&#160;Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for.&#160;The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative&#160;forcing. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an<br>unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.</p></div></dd><div>
