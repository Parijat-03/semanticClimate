Environmental racism&#8212;the silencing of marginalized people and activists of color&#8212;has been widely reported.<sup><xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Vanessa Nakate, a youth activist from Uganda, founded the Rise Up Movement to give voice to African climate activists who have been systematically silenced by the media in international settings and addressed primarily as victims of climate change.<sup><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Nakate experienced this discrimination herself when the Associated Press removed her image from a photograph with other (white) youth climate activists participating in the 2020 Davos World Economic Forum Summit.<sup><xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> For Nakate and many other young activists of color, the fight for climate justice starts with the eradication of racial injustice.</p>
