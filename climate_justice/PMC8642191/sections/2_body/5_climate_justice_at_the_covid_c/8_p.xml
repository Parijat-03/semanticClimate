The study found the EU to have the &#8216;greenest&#8217; pandemic stimulus measures of any G20 participant (Vivid Economics/F4B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2021a</xref>, 4). In contrast, China&#8217;s stimulus plans were rated as having a net negative impact on the environment, with relaxation of environmental reporting requirements and &#8216;unconditional&#8217; stimulus for polluting industries. The study nevertheless noted that China&#8217;s score had improved in recent months due to &#8216;stricter emission reduction targets and ambitions for massive renewable energy deployment&#8217; (Ibid, 15). A July 2021 report from the same organisations found that, overall, &#8216;greenness of stimulus is improving slightly over time&#8217;, with the trend observable in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> due to the launch of its carbon market, new emission targets and announced phase-out of fossil-fuel vehicles (Vivid Economics/F4B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021b</xref>, 4, 11).</p>
