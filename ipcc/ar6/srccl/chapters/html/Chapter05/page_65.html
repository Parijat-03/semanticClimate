These are broadly similar across most countries. These are typically capped at the number of calories and higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and lower in animal-sourced foods, fats and sugar. Such diets have the potential to be both more sustainable and healthier than alternative diets (but healthy diets are not necessarily sustainable and vice versa). The extent to which the mitigation potential of dietary choices can be realised requires both climate change and health being considered together. Socio-economic (prices, rebound effects), political, and cultural contexts would require significant consideration to enable this mitigation potential to be realised.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="286.62" top="422.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 422.98; y1: 432.98; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="422.98" x1="286.62">1.6.4 Sustainable integrated agricultural systems</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="399.11"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 399.11; y1: 408.61; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="399.11" x1="313.26">A range of integrated agricultural systems are being tested to evaluate synergies between mitigation and adaptation and lead to low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways for sustainable food security and ecosystem health (</span><span style="x0: 214.28; x1: 217.09; y0: 363.11; y1: 372.61; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="214.28" y0="363.11" x1="313.24">robust evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="x0: 103.88; x1: 106.52; y0: 351.11; y1: 360.61; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="103.88" y0="351.11" x1="313.25">). Integration refers to the use of practices that enhance an agroecosystem&#8217;s mitigation, resilience, and sustainability functions. These systems follow holistic approaches with the objective of achieving biophysical, socio-cultural, and economic benefits from land management systems (Sanz et al. 2017). These integrated systems may include agroecology (FAO et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2015), climate smart agriculture (FAO 2011c; Lipper et al. 2014; Aggarwal et al. 2018), conservation agriculture (Aryal et al. 2016; Sapkota et al. 2015), and sustainable intensification (FAO 2011d; Godfray 2015), amongst others. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.2" top="219.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 72.59; y0: 219.13; y1: 228.63; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="219.13" x1="313.2">Many of these systems are complementary in some of their practices, although they tend to be based on different narratives (Wezel et al. 2015; Lampkin et al. 2015; Pimbert 2015). They have been tested in various production systems around the world (Dinesh et al. 2017; Jat et al. 2016; Sapkota et al. 2015 and Neufeldt et al. 2013). Many technical innovations, for example, precision nutrient management (Sapkota et al. 2014) and precision water management (Jat et al. 2015), can lead to both adaptation and mitigation outcomes and even synergies; although negative adaptation and mitigation outcomes (i.e.,&#160;trade-offs) are often overlooked. Adaptation potential of ecologically intensive systems includes crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting the role of microbial assemblages (Section&#160;5.3).

It started with a&#160;focus at the farm level but has expanded to include the range of food system activities (Benkeblia 2018). Agroecology builds systems resilience through knowledge-intensive practices relying on traditional farming systems and co-generation of new insights and information with stakeholders through participatory action research (Men&#233;ndez et al. 2013). It provides a&#160;multidimensional view of food systems within ecosystems, building on ILK and co-evolving with the experiences of local people, available natural resources, access to these resources, and ability to share and pass on knowledge among communities and generations, emphasising the inter-relatedness of all agroecosystem components and the complex dynamics of ecological processes (Vandermeer 1995). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="471.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 471.13; y1: 480.63; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="471.13" x1="571.78">At the farm level, agroecological practices recycle biomass and regenerate soil biotic activities. They strive to attain balance in nutrient flows to secure favourable soil and plant growth conditions, minimise loss of water and nutrients, and improve use of solar radiation. Practices include efficient microclimate management, soil cover, appropriate planting time and genetic diversity. They seek to promote ecological processes and services such as nutrient cycling, balanced predator/prey interactions, competition, symbiosis, and successional changes. The overall goal is to benefit human and non-human communities in the ecological sphere, with fewer negative environmental or social impacts and fewer external inputs (Vandermeer et al. 1998; Altieri et al. 1998). From a&#160;food system focus, agroecology provides management options in terms of commercialisation and consumption through the promotion of short food chains and healthy diets (Pimbert and Lemke 2018; Loconto et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="267.15"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 267.15; y1: 276.65; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="267.15" x1="571.74">Agroecology has been proposed as a&#160;key set of practices in building climate resilience (FAO et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2015). These can enhance on-farm diversity (of genes, species, and ecosystems) through a&#160;landscape approach (FAO 2018g). Outcomes include soil conservation and restoration and thus soil carbon sequestration, reduction of the use of mineral and chemical fertilisers, watershed protection, promotion of local food systems, waste reduction, and fair access to healthy food through nutritious and diversified diets (Pimbert and Lemke 2018; Kremen et al. 2012; Goh 2011; Gliessman and Engles 2014). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="135.17"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 135.17; y1: 144.67; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="135.17" x1="571.74">A principle in agroecology is to contribute to food production by smallholder farmers (Altieri 2002).
