One source of fragmentation is divisions among the different alternative or renewable energy industries, which must operate in a political arena dominated by powerful fossil fuel incumbents (Kelsey and Meckling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2018</xref>). For example, a study of lobbying and testimony in Massachusetts found that more concentrated renewable energy industries were better able to engage in paid lobbying than dispersed ones (Culhane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021</xref>). Relatedly, Si and Stephens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2021</xref>) find disparate participation among solar developers and installers surrounding efforts to target solar installation among low-income households in Massachusetts. The solar industry is more fragmented in small installation firms, whereas the wind industry has higher capital barriers to entry and is consequently concentrated in a few, large firms. Solar firms are further divided between rooftop residential developers and those installing utility-scale projects, and between in-state and out-of-state firms (Stokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2020</xref>).</p>
