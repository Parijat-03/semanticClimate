Conjoining response options to maximise social, climatic and environmental bene&#64257;ts will require framing of such actions as strong pathways to sustainable development (Ayers and Dodman 2010). As the chapter has pointed out, there are many potential options for synergies, especially among several response options that might be applied together and in coordination with one another (such as dietary change and improved land management measures). This coordination will help ensure that synergies are met and trade-offs minimised, but this will require deliberate coordination across multiple scales, actors and sectors. For example, there are a variety of response options available at different scales that could form portfolios of measures applied by different stakeholders from farm to international scales. Agricultural diversi&#64257;cation and use of local seeds by smallholders can be particularly useful poverty eradication and biodiversity conservation measures, but are only successful when higher scales, such as national and international markets and supply chains, also value these goods in trade regimes, and consumers see the bene&#64257;ts of purchasing these goods. However, the land and food sectors face particular challenges of institutional fragmentation, and often suffer from a lack of engagement between stakeholders at different scales (Biermann et&#160;al. 2009; Deininger et&#160;al. 2014) (see Chapter 7, Section&#160;7.6.2). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.54" top="387.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.92; y0: 387.56; y1: 397.06; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="387.56" x1="307.54">Many of the response options listed in this chapter could be potentially implemented as &#8216;community-based&#8217; actions, including community-based reforestation, community-based insurance, or community-based disaster risk management. Grounding response options in community approaches aims to identify, assist and implement activities &#8216;that strengthen the capacity of local people to adapt to living in a riskier and less predictable climate&#8217; (Ayers and Forsyth 2009). Research shows that people willingly come together to provide mutual aid and protection against risk, to manage natural resources, and to work cooperatively to &#64257;nd solutions to environmental provisioning problems. Some activities that fall under this type of collective action include the creation of institutions or rules, working cooperatively to manage a resource by restricting some activities and encouraging others, sharing information to improve public goods, or mobilising resources (such as capital) to &#64257;x a collective problem (Ostrom 2000; Poteete and Ostrom 2004), or engagement in participatory land-use planning (Bourgoin 2012; Evers and Hofmeister 2011). These participatory processes &#8216;are likely to lead to more bene&#64257;cial environmental outcomes through better informed, sustainable decisions, and win-win solutions regarding economic and conservation objectives&#8217; (Vente et&#160;al. 2016), and evaluations of community-based response options have been generally positive (Karim and Thiel 2017; Tompkins and Adger 2004). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="735.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 735.6; y1: 745.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.6" x1="566.12">Agrawal (2001) has identi&#64257;ed more than 30 different indicators that have been important in understanding who undertakes collective action for the environment, including: the size of the group undertaking action; the type and distribution of the bene&#64257;ts from the action; the heterogeneity of the group; the dependence of the group on these bene&#64257;ts; the presence of leadership; presence of social capital and trust; and autonomy and independence to make and enforce rules. Alternatively, when households expect the government to undertake response actions, they have less incentive to join in collective action, as the state role has &#8216;crowded out&#8217; local cooperation (Adger 2009). High levels of social trust and capital can increase willingness of farmers to engage in response options, such as improved soil management or carbon forestry (Stringer et&#160;al. 2012; Lee 2017), and social capital helps with connectivity across levels of SESs (Brondizio et&#160;al. 2009). Dietz et&#160;al. (2013) lay out important policy directions for more successful facilitation of collective action across scales and stakeholders. These include: providing information; dealing with con&#64258;ict; inducing rule compliance; providing physical, technical or institutional infrastructure; and being prepared for change. The adoption of participatory protocols and structured processes to select response options together with stakeholders will likely lead to greater success in coordination and participation (Bautista et&#160;al. 2017; Franks 2010; Schwilch et&#160;al. 2012a).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="447.63"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 447.63; y1: 457.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="447.63" x1="566.08">However, wider adoption of community-based approaches is potentially hampered by several factors, including the fact that most are small-scale (Forsyth 2013; Ensor et&#160;al. 2014) and it is often unclear how to assess criteria of success (Forsyth 2013). Others also caution that community-based approaches often are not able to adequately address the key drivers of vulnerability such as inequality and uneven power relations (Nagoda and Nightingale 2017). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="466.66" top="351.65"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 351.65; y1: 361.15; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="318.05" y0="351.65" x1="466.66">Moving from response options to policies</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="327.65"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 327.65; y1: 337.15; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="327.65" x1="566.12">Chapter 7 discusses in further depth the risks and challenges involved in formulating policy responses that meet the demands for sustainable land management and development outcomes, such as food security, community adaptation and poverty alleviation. Table&#160;7.1 in Chapter 7 maps how speci&#64257;c response options might be turned into policies; for example, to implement a response option aimed at agricultural diversi&#64257;cation, a range of policies from elimination of agricultural subsidies (which might favour single crops) to environmental farm programmes and agro-environmental payments (to encourage alternative crops). Oftentimes, any particular response option might have a variety of potential policy pathways that might address different scales or stakeholders or take on different aspects of coordination and integration (Section 7.6.1). Given the unique challenges of decision-making under uncertainty in future climate scenarios, Chapter 7 particularly discusses the need for &#64258;exible, iterative, and adaptive processes to turn response options into policy&#160;frameworks.</span></div></body></html>
