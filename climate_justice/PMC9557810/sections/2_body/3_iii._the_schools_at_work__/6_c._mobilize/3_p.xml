women and men with different disabilities share their experience of the city
with taxi drivers and, in the process, build new ways of understanding how their
bodies interact in a common territory. The pedagogic practice of &#8220;mobilizing&#8221;,
in a literal sense, fosters the inclusion of marginalized groups in the city,
not merely by adapting the city to their particular needs through retrofitted
urban design, but by advocating for more pluralistic and intersectional
perspectives on urban mobilities. In this school, <italic toggle="yes">Corporaci&#243;n
Regi&#243;n</italic>, working together with <italic toggle="yes">Fuerza Incluyente</italic>,
co-developed an experiential pedagogy which opens spaces to encounter
diversities, enhancing possibilities for people with disabilities to move around
the city, while simultaneously generating a new consciousness among key actors
and institutions responsible for enhancing mobility for all.</p>
