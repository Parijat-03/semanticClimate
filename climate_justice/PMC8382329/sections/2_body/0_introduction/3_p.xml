There is agreement that climate change is global, both in its cause and effect dimensions. It is a collective action problem, so there is a built-in compulsion for addressing its &#8220;cause&#8221; through universal cooperation, as the Paris Agreement vindicates. The mitigation regime is not succeeding yet because of disagreements over sharing of responsibility among major emitters, but nobody questions the properties of restoring climate stability as a life-support global public good (GPG), the benefits of which are available to everyone and nobody can be excluded. Then, what about the &#8220;effect&#8221; of antecedent stock deposition of emissions, or the current undersupply of mitigation, that inflicts increasingly unbearable harm to the PVCs? Should not climate impacts be regarded as a global public bad (GPB), and hence, adaptation to cope with those bads as GPG? This article lays out the case for doing so.</p>
