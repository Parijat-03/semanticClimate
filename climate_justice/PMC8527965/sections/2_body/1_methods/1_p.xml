We created the questionnaire using the Checkbox survey software and followed ethical guidelines and approval from the University of Queensland (approval number 2020000640). The majority of the 27 questions were open-ended (creating significant qualitative data) and drew on stakeholder&#8217;s knowledge, experiences and practices. Questions centred around key topics including NELD knowledge gaps, understandings of NELD in the Pacific Islands, experiences of NELD and strategies to respond to NELD. We used the following 12 categories of NELD (based on Morrissey and Oliver-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>) to structure our questions around the range of existing and anticipated types of NELD: human life, human health, human mobility, territory, culture and heritage, Indigenous and local knowledge, biodiversity, ecosystem services, place attachment and sense of place, social cohesion, agency, and identity.</p>
