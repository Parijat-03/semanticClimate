<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Accelerometers exist nowadays for remote measurement of animal gait [<xref rid="B60-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This can determine when the animal is lying or walking [<xref rid="B48-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The method is also useful in the determination of lameness, animal sickness, or how much the animal feeds [<xref rid="B61-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], based on the distance covered by the animal against time. The device can be mounted on the leg, ear or other parts of the animal, so that it continuously sends signals to the farmers&#8217; mobile phone. When the animal is lying down, the instrument automatically changes its processing speed. The device was also utilized in monitoring the health of fishes, by attaching it to their fins [<xref rid="B62-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A demerit of the system, however, is the fact that continuous processing of mobility data tends to rapidly reduce battery life [<xref rid="B63-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
