<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">On the other hand, CM is largely about &#8216;human&#8217; mobility (<xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">McLeman, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0535" ref-type="bibr">Piguet, 2013</xref>). Little to no attention is given to the proactive and combined relocation of physical infrastructure, homes, and businesses in at-risk areas. Furthermore, scholarship on CM tends to focus, although not exclusively, on the movement of people from the Global South (<xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">Myers, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0635" ref-type="bibr">Warner et al., 2010</xref>). For example, 50 to 200 million people are predicted to be forced to move by 2050, due to climate change impacts (<xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">Thomas and Benjamin, 2018</xref>). While these numbers have been well cited by academics and international agencies (<xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">Myers, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">IOM, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0635" ref-type="bibr">Warner et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0535" ref-type="bibr">Piguet, 2013</xref>), it is unclear whether they include those that may relocate globally through MR. If the former is not inclusive of MR cases, it means we may have a bigger crisis at hand than previously anticipated. For instance, in a revised estimate of global coastlines modelled with SLR and coastal flooding, <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">Kulp and Strauss (2019)</xref> showed that under a high emissions scenario up to 340 million people could be displaced by 2050 and 630 million by 2100. This is a significantly higher estimates than predicted in a recent World Bank report (see, <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
