<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par80">During the studied period, other energy industries represented the fourth major CO<sub>2</sub> emitting sector in Australia. The emissions resulting from these activities increased from 14 to 35 MT from 1990 to 2017 as indicated by IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) data. On the other hand, the increase in residential sector emissions was negligible. Between 1990 and 2017, the emissions of this sector increased slightly from 6 to 9 MT (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). However, residential buildings accounted for the third largest share in the country&#8217;s energy consumption. As IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) data revealed, the energy consumption of this sector increased from 7490 to 10,540 ktoe, between 1990 and 2017. Clearly, the empirical results of this study show that improvements in energy intensity in Australia were highly commendable during the studied period. The energy intensity in the country decreased from 0.092 to 0.059, and this was a successful outcome for the sustainability targets. However, further achievements are possible if particular attention is paid to sectors that are highly energy intensive such as transportation, industry, and residential buildings in Australia. The country should invest more in energy saving technologies, especially in the transportation and industry sectors.</p>
