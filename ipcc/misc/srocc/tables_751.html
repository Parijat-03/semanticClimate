      <td>It is very likely that bioenergy expansion at a scale that contributes significantly to global climate mitigation efforts (see Cross-Chapter\nBox 7 in Chapter 6) will result in substantial land-use change (Berndes et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2014a; Wilson et al. 2014; Behrman et al.\n2015; Richards et al. 2017; Harris et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017a). There is medium evidence and high agreement that land-use change\nat such scale presents a variety of positive and negative socio-economic and environmental impacts that lead to risks and trade-offs\nthat must be managed or governed across different levels (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018a; Kurian 2017; Franz et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2016;\nLarcom and van Gevelt 2017; Lubis et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2015b; Rasul 2014; Bonsch et al. 2016; Karabulut et al. 2018; Mayor et\nal. 2015). There is medium evidence and high agreement that impacts vary considerably according to factors such as initial land-use\ntype, choice of crops, initial carbon stocks, climatic region, soil types and the management regime and adopted technologies (Qin et\nal. 2016; Del Grosso et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017; Davis et al. 2013; Mello et al. 2014; Hudiburg et al. 2015; Carvalho et al. 2016; Silva-\nOlaya et al. 2017; Whitaker et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2015b).</td>

      <td>There is medium evidence and high agreement that significant socio-economic impacts requiring additional policy responses can occur\nwhen agricultural lands and/or food crops are used for bioenergy, due to competition between food and fuel (Harvey and Pilgrim 2011;\nRosillo Call&#233; and Johnson 2010b), including impacts on food prices (Martin Persson 2015; Roberts and Schlenker 2013; Borychowski\nand Czy&#380;ewski 2015; Koizumi 2014; Muratori et al. 2016; Popp et al. 2014b; Araujo Enciso et al. 2016) and impacts on food security\n(Popp et al. 2014b; Bailey 2013; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018b; Rulli et al. 2016; Yamagata et al. 2018; Kline et al. 2017; Schr&#246;der et al. 2018;\nFranz et al. 2017; Mohr et al. 2016). Additionally, crops such as sugarcane, which are water-intensive when used for ethanol production,\nhave a trade-off with water and downstream ES and other crops more important for food security (Rulli et al. 2016; Gheewala et\nal. 2011). Alongside negative impacts that might fall on urban consumers (who purchase both food and energy), there is medium\nevidence and medium agreement that rural producers or farmers can increase income or strengthen livelihoods by diversifying into\nbiofuel crops that have an established market (Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Mudombi et al. 2018a; Gasparatos et al. 2018a,b,c; von Maltitz\net al. 2018; Kline et al. 2017; Rodr&#237;guez Morales and Rodr&#237;guez L&#243;pez 2017; Dale et al. 2015; Lee and Lazarus 2013; Rodr&#237;guez-Morales\n2018). A key governance mechanism that has emerged in response to such concerns, (especially during the past decade) are standards\nand certification systems that include food security and land rights in addition to general criteria or indicators related to sustainable\nuse of land and biomass (Section 7.4.6.3). There is medium evidence and medium agreement that policies promoting use of wastes\nand residues, use of non-edible crops and/or reliance on degraded and marginal lands for bioenergy could reduce land competition\nand associated risk for food security (Manning et al. 2015; Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2018a; Gu and Wylie 2017; Kline et al.\n2017; Schr&#246;der et al. 2018; Suckall et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2014a; Lal 2013).</td>

      <td>There is medium evidence and high agreement that good governance, including policy coherence and coordination across the different\nsectors involved (agriculture, forestry, livestock, energy, transport) (Section 7.6.2) can help to reduce the risks and increase the co-\nbenefits of bioenergy expansion (Makkonen et al. 2015; Di Gregorio et al. 2017; Schut et al. 2013; Mukhtarov et al.; Torvanger 2019a;\nM&#252;ller et al. 2015; Nkonya et al. 2015; Johnson and Silveira 2014; Lundmark et al. 2014; Schultz et al. 2015; Silveira and Johnson\n2016; Giessen et al. 2016b; Stattman et al. 2018b; Bennich et al. 2017b). There is medium evidence and high agreement that the\nnexus approach can help to address interconnected biomass resource management challenges and entrenched economic interests,\nand leverage synergies in the systemic governance of risk. (Bizikova et al. 2013; Rouillard et al. 2017; Pahl-Wostl 2017a; Lele et al.\n2013; Rodr&#237;guez Morales and Rodr&#237;guez L&#243;pez 2017; Larcom and van Gevelt 2017; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018a; Rulli et al. 2016; Rasul and\nSharma 2016; Weitz et al. 2017b; Karlberg et al. 2015).</td>

      <td>A key issue for governance of biofuels and bioenergy, as well as land-use governance more generally, during the past decade is\nthe need for new governance mechanisms across different levels as land-use policies and bioenergy investments are scaled up and\nresult in wider impacts (Section 7.6). There is low evidence and medium agreement that hybrid governance mechanisms can promote\nsustainable bioenergy investments and land-use pathways. This hybrid governance can include multi-level, transnational governance,\nand private-led or partnership-style (polycentric) governance, complementing national-level, strong public coordination (government\nand public administration) (Section 7.6.2) (Pahl-Wostl 2017a; Pacheco et al. 2016; Winickoff and Mondou 2017; Nagendra and Ostrom\n2012; Jordan et al. 2015a; Djalante et al. 2013; Purkus, A, Gawel, E. and Thr&#228;n, D. 2012; Purkus et al. 2018; Stattman et al.; Rietig 2018;\nCavicchi et al. 2017; Stupak et al. 2016; Stupak and Raulund-Rasmussen 2016; Westberg and Johnson 2013; Giessen et al. 2016b;\nJohnson and Silveira 2014; Stattman et al. 2018b; Mukhtarov et al.; Torvanger 2019b).</td>
