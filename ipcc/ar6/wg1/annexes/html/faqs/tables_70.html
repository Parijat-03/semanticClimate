      <td>FAQ 12.2: What are climatic thresholds and why are they important?\nMany systems have thresholds that can lead to sudden changes, if climate conditions exceed them.\nAdaptation and risk management efforts can increase overall system resilience by identifying and\nchanging tolerance thresholds.\nIncreasing Critical Limiting\ncrop production temperature threshold temperature threshold\nOptimal growth Reduced growth Crop failure\nIncreasing daily maximum temperature\nFAQ 12.2, Figure 1 | Crop response to maximum temperature thresholds. Crop growth rate responds to daily maximum temperature increases,\nleading to reduced growth and crop failure as temperatures exceed critical and limiting temperature thresholds, respectively. Note that changes in other\nenvironmental factors (such as carbon dioxide and water) may increase the tolerance of plants to increasing temperatures.</td>
