Benchmarks are indices which are used either to set the value of a financial product or to track the performance of an investment fund, e.g. LIBOR for interest rates or Brent Crude for oil. The climate benchmarks regulation creates two new categories of benchmark in order to harmonise benchmark standards and dispel confusion created by a proliferation of low-carbon indices. An &#8216;EU Climate Transition Benchmark&#8217; is a benchmark where the underlying assets of which are &#8216;selected, weighted or excluded in such a manner that the resulting benchmark portfolio is on a decarbonisation trajectory&#8217;. More ambitiously, an &#8216;EU Paris-aligned Benchmark&#8217; has underlying assets which &#8216;are selected, weighted or excluded in such a manner that the resulting benchmark portfolio&#8217;s carbon emissions are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement&#8217;, the activities of which &#8216;do not significantly harm other environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives&#8217; (European Parliament/Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019a</xref>, art. 1).</p>
