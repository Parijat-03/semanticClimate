This&#160;range is closely related to equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS, which measures how climate models respond to a&#160;doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Models with high climate sensitivity project stronger future warming. Some climate models of the new generation are more sensitive than the range assessed in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. This leads to end-of-century global warming in some simulations of up to 2&#176;C&#8211;3&#176;C above the current IPCC best estimate. Although these higher warming levels are not expected to occur, high-ECS models are useful for exploring low-likelihood, high-impact futures.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="87.03" top="576.22"><span x0="69.02" y0="576.22" x1="87.03" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 576.22; y1: 585.22; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">The </span><span style="x0: 87.91; x1: 92.92; y0: 576.22; y1: 585.22; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QKTXWS+FrutigerLTStd-Italic;" x0="87.91" y0="576.22" x1="217.23">equilibrium climate sensitivity </span><span x0="218.11" y0="576.22" x1="539.81" style="x0: 218.11; x1: 221.11; y0: 576.22; y1: 585.22; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">(ECS) is defined as the long-term global warming caused by a&#160;doubling of carbon dioxide above its pre-industrial concentration.

For example, warming in the Arctic melts sea ice, resulting in more open ocean area, which is darker and therefore absorbs more sunlight, further intensifying the initial warming. It remains challenging to represent realistically all the processes involved in these feedback loops, particularly those related to clouds (see FAQ 7.2). Such identified model errors are now taken into account, and other known, but generally weak, feedback loops that are typically not included in models are now included in the assessment of ECS.</span><span style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 342.27; y1: 351.27; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AJXIUY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="69.02" y0="342.27" x1="75.86">&#8226; </span><span x0="83.2" y0="342.27" x1="539.83" style="x0: 83.2; x1: 89.7; y0: 342.27; y1: 351.27; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Historical warming since early industrialisation provides strong evidence that climate sensitivity is not small. Since 1850, the concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased, and as a&#160;result the Earth has warmed by about 1.1&#176;C. However, relying on this industrial-era warming to estimate ECS is challenging, partly because some of the warming from greenhouse gases was offset by cooling from aerosol particles and partly because the ocean is still responding to past increases in carbon dioxide.</span><span style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 282.28; y1: 291.28; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AJXIUY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="69.02" y0="282.28" x1="75.86">&#8226; </span><span x0="83.2" y0="282.28" x1="539.85" style="x0: 83.2; x1: 88.2; y0: 282.28; y1: 291.28; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Evidence from ancient climates that had reached equilibrium with greenhouse gas concentrations, such as the coldest period of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago, or warmer periods further back in time, provide useful data on the ECS of the climate system (see FAQ 1.3).</span><span style="x0: 69.02; x1: 73.52; y0: 246.29; y1: 255.29; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AJXIUY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="69.02" y0="246.29" x1="75.86">&#8226; </span><span x0="83.2" y0="246.29" x1="539.8" style="x0: 83.2; x1: 87.7; y0: 246.29; y1: 255.29; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Statistical approaches linking model ECS values with observed changes, such as global warming since the 1970s, provide complementary evidence.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.83" top="216.3"><span x0="69.02" y0="216.3" x1="539.83" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 216.3; y1: 225.3; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">All four lines of evidence rely, to some extent, on climate models, and interpreting the evidence often benefits from model diversity and spread in modelled climate sensitivity.
