<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par22">Process philosophy is an antecedent of SR known to possess a differentiated relational ontology (Keller and Daniell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2002</xref>; Faber and Stephenson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>; Shaviro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2014</xref>). The progenitor of process philosophy, Alfred North Whitehead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1929</xref>), posited that every actual entity composes societies of ever-greater societies, while being both internally related and differentiated from other actual entities. The social, he claimed, &#8220;is a way of describing how each entity is constituted by and through its environment&#8221; (Halewood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>, p. 121). Recent works by Henning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>), Ims et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2015</xref>), Stengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2015</xref>), Muraca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>), Latour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017</xref>), Kaaronen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>), and Mancilla et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2019</xref>) demonstrate the multiple ways process-relational ontologies shift epistemological and ethical orientations to human&#8211;nature interactions based on an understanding of their co-constitution. Latour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017</xref>) is probably one of the best-known authors writing about process philosophy and ecology who argues that the Earth should be conceived as a complex assemblage of living and agential processes which should be given political standing.</p>
