This degradation includes impact on green cover, loss of biodiversity and aesthetics, air pollution, surface and ground water pollution, loss of water bodies, receding water table, high incidence of diseases and mortality. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.32" top="637.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="637.23" x1="508.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 83.35; y0: 637.23; y1: 649.23; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">With the rising economic growth, city has faced environmental problems due to high levels of air pollution. Major sources of air pollution in Delhi include transport, power and industrial sectors. Although the SOx &amp; CO levels are just within the permissible limits but the levels of NOx, suspended particulate matter and the respiratory particulate matter in the air are alarming.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.2" top="545.76"><span x0="72.02" y0="545.76" x1="508.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 545.76; y1: 557.76; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi&#8217;s sources of water typically consist of surface and ground water where surface water contributes to over 86% of Delhi&#8217;s total drinking water. Yamuna provides the major share of this water. Other sources of drinking water supply to Delhi include the Himalayan Rivers through different interstate arrangements and sub-surface sources like Ranney wells and tube wells. It is reported that there are 1022 water bodies including lakes, ponds and reservoirs in Delhi but most of them have depleted. In addition to quantity, the quality of groundwater is also deteriorating becoming unfit for human consumption. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.32" top="422.74"><span x0="72.02" y0="422.74" x1="508.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 422.74; y1: 434.74; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The river Yamuna enters Delhi at Palla at north and exits at Jaitpur in south after passing through 52 km in Delhi stretch. The 22 km urban stretch below Wazirabad reservoir of the river is virtually a sewer. The flood plains have been encroached and degraded due to dumping of solid waste and whatever left is under agriculture. Almost all the wetlands are silted and filled. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.25" top="331.42"><span x0="72.02" y0="331.42" x1="508.25" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 331.42; y1: 343.42; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The degradation of the forest cover in Delhi sums up the threat to not only the environment but to the overall sustainability of the city. The Ridge area of Delhi has degraded tremendously due to by roads, buildings, traffic, and garbage dumping, lopping of trees and grazing by livestock. Mining and quarrying activities in the past have degraded the South-Central Ridge causing enormous loss to biodiversity. The Ridge is predominantly composed of an alien invasive species &#8211; </span><span x0="265.97" y0="251.95" x1="353.98" style="x0: 265.97; x1: 273.3; y0: 251.95; y1: 263.95; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Prosopis juliflora </span><span x0="353.95" y0="251.95" x1="508.37" style="x0: 353.95; x1: 359.28; y0: 251.95; y1: 263.95; width: 5.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">and the alien weed species such as </span><span x0="89.54" y0="236.11" x1="132.59" style="x0: 89.54; x1: 96.22; y0: 236.11; y1: 248.11; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Lantana.</span><span x0="132.62" y0="236.11" x1="508.08" style="x0: 132.62; x1: 141.28; y0: 236.11; y1: 248.11; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">An ecologically important location, the Asola Wildlife sanctuary, was established to protect and conserve the city&#8217;s flora and fauna.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.2" top="192.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="192.43" x1="508.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 192.43; y1: 204.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The city suffers from all the health related problems caused by the polluted atmosphere. High occurrence of respiratory infections, heart problems, sickness from water and vector-borne diseases and other diseases because of exposure to ambient and indoor pollutants and inappropriate disposal practices of municipal solid waste have become the way of life in the city. Poor living conditions, constant exposure to the pollutants, untreated wastes has resulted in high incidence of diseases like diarrhea, hepatitis, dengue and others. </span></div></body></html>
