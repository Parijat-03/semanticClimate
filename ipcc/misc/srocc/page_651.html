Tools such as stakeholder mapping, in which affected and interested parties are identi&#64257;ed and described in terms of their interrelationships and current or future objectives and aspirations, and scenario-based stakeholder engagement, which combines stakeholder analysis with climate scenarios, are increasingly being applied to facilitate better planning outcomes (Tompkins et&#160;al. 2008; Pomeroy and Douvere 2008; Star et&#160;al. 2016). Facilitated dialogues early in design processes have shown good success in bringing multiple and sometimes con&#64258;icting stakeholders to the table to discuss synergies and trade-offs around policy implementation (Gopnik et&#160;al. 2012). Knowledge exchange, social learning, and other concepts are also increasingly being incorporated into understanding how to facilitate sustainable land management (Djenontin et&#160;al. 2018), as evidence suggests that negotiating the complexity of socio-ecological systems (SES) requires &#64258;exible learning arrangements, in particular for multiple stakeholders (Gerlak and Heikkila 2011; Armitage et&#160;al. 2018; Heikkila and Gerlak 2018). Social learning has been de&#64257;ned as &#8216;a&#160;change in understanding and skills that becomes situated in groups of actors/communities of practice through social interactions,&#8217; (Albert et&#160;al. 2012), and social learning is often linked with attempts to increase levels of participation in decision-making, from consultation to more serious community control (Collins and Ison 2009; McCrum et&#160;al. 2009). Learning also facilitates responses to emerging problems and helps actors in SESs grapple with complexity.

Suggestions to facilitate social learning, ARM, and decision-making include extending science-policy networks and using local bridging organisations, such as extension services, for knowledge co-production (Bidwell et&#160;al. 2013; B&#246;cher and Krott 2014; Howarth and Monasterolo 2017) (see further discussion in Chapter 7, Section 7.5).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.79" top="243.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 243.58; y1: 253.08; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.58" x1="571.79">Ensuring that women are included as key stakeholders in response option implementation is also important, as gender norms and roles affect vulnerability and access to resources, and gender inequality limits the possible range of responses for adoption by women (Lambrou and Piana 2006). For example, environmental change may increase women&#8217;s workload as their access to natural resources may decline, or they may have to take up low-wage labour if agriculture becomes unsuitable in their local areas under climate change (Nelson et&#160;al. 2002). Every response option considered in this chapter potentially has a gender dimension to it that needs to be taken into consideration (Tables 6.73&#8211;6.75 note how response options intersect with SDG 5 Gender Equality); for example, to address food security through sustainable intensi&#64257;cation will clearly have to address female farmers in Africa (Kondylis et&#160;al. 2016; Garcia and Wanner 2017) (for&#160;further information, see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter&#160;7). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="451.31" top="415.22"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.9; y0: 415.22; y1: 423.22; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="415.22" x1="451.31">Figure 6.9 |  Relationship between changes in government effectiveness (GE) and changes in land management. </span><span style="x0: 452.01; x1: 456.75; y0: 415.16; y1: 423.16; width: 4.74; font-size: 8.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEL+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="452.01" y0="415.16" x1="571.37">Notes: &#916;NDVI = Change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (baseline year 2001, Endline year 2010).
