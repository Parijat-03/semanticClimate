RWH increases the amount of water available for agriculture and livelihoods through the capture and storage of runoff, while at the same time reducing the intensity of peak &#64258;ows following high-intensity rainfall events. It is therefore often highlighted as a&#160;practical response to dryness (i.e., long-term aridity and low seasonal precipitation) and rainfall variability, both of which are projected to become more acute over time in some dryland areas (Dile et al. 2013; Vohland and Barry 2009).

A&#160;global meta-analysis of changes in crop production due to the adoption of RWH techniques noted an average increase in yields of 78%, ranging from &#8211;28% to 468% (Bouma and W&#246;sten 2016). Of particular relevance to climate change in drylands is that the relative impact of RWH on agricultural production generally increases with increasing dryness. Relative yield improvements due to the adoption of RWH were signi&#64257;cantly higher in years with less than 330 mm rainfall, compared to years with more than 330 mm (Bouma and W&#246;sten 2016). Despite delivering a&#160;clear set of bene&#64257;ts, there are some issues that need to be considered. The impact of RWH may vary at different temporal and spatial scales (Vohland and Barry 2009). At a&#160;plot scale, RWH structures may increase available water and enhance agricultural production, SOC and nutrient availability, yet at a&#160;catchment scale, they may reduce runoff to downstream uses (Meijer et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2012; Vohland and Barry 2009; Yosef and Asmamaw 2015). Inappropriate storage of water in warm climes can lead to an increase in water related diseases unless managed correctly, for example, schistosomiasis and malaria (Boelee et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="183.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 183.59; y1: 193.09; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="183.59" x1="313.23">Integrated crop&#8211;soil&#8211;water management may also deliver climate change </span><span style="x0: 93.41; x1: 100.27; y0: 171.59; y1: 181.09; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="93.41" y0="171.59" x1="132.62">mitigation </span><span style="x0: 132.51; x1: 137.08; y0: 171.59; y1: 181.09; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="132.51" y0="171.59" x1="313.24">bene&#64257;ts through avoiding, reducing and reversing the loss of SOC (Table&#160;6.5).

Trade-offs may therefore need to be considered to ensure that rangeland diversity and production are resilient to climate change (Plaza-Bonilla et al. 2015; van Oijen et al. 2018). In certain locations, even light to moderate grazing has led to a&#160;signi&#64257;cant decrease in the occurrence of particular species, especially forbs (O&#8217;Connor et al. 2011; Scott-shaw and Morris 2015). In other locations, species richness is only signi&#64257;cantly impacted by heavy grazing and is able to withstand light to moderate grazing (Divinsky et al. 2017). A&#160;context speci&#64257;c evaluation of how grazing and &#64257;re impact particular species may therefore be required to ensure the persistence of target species over time (Marty 2005). A&#160;similar trade-off may need to be considered between soil carbon sequestration and livestock production. As noted by Plaza-Bonilla et al. (2015) increasing grazing pressure has been found to increase SOC stocks in some locations, and decrease them in others.
