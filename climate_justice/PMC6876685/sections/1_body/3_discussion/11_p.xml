<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The importance of shifting from focusing on a readerly literacy to a writerly one in introductory science course pedagogy is hard to overstate. Many students in introductory biology likely take the course because it is required (perhaps as preparatory coursework for health&#8208;oriented careers), irrespective of whether they have a deep interest in climate, ecology, or the environment&#8212;affording instructors the opportunity to reach a group of students who might not typically think or learn about climate change, and to connect its impacts with their lives in ways that inspire them to act. Returning to the &#8220;preaching to the choir&#8221; component of our title, students in this kind of course may be in the proverbial choir, but not all of them are there entirely of their own volition.</p>
