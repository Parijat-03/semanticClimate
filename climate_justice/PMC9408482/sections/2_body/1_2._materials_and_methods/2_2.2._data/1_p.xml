<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To identify the needs of the LDPCs, a recently published (2021) list of 46 countries declared as the least developed countries in the post-COVID world by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-09941" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is reviewed to check their status as party countries to the PA. All the 46 least developed countries listed in the list are found to be a party to the PA. The NDC submission records of these 46 LDPCs were accessed from the NDC public registry of the UNFCCC. Out of 46 countries, 11 NDCs were found to be submitted in languages other than English. The conception of needs in this study is delimited to the data set of 35 LDPCs whose NDCs were available in the English language.</p>
