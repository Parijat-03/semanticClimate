      <td>upon the type of river basin, the surface landscape, the extent and duration of the rainfall, and how wet the\nground is before the rainfall event (FAQ 8.2, Figure 1). Some regions will experience a drying in the soil as the\nclimate warms, particularly in subtropical climates, which could make floods from a rainfall event less probable\nbecause the ground can potentially soak up more of the rain. On the other hand, less frequent but more intense\ndownpours can lead to dry, hard ground that is less able to soak up heavy rainfall when it does occur, resulting\nin more runoff into lakes, rivers and hollows. Earlier spring snowmelt combined with more precipitation falling\nas rain rather than snow can trigger flood events in cold regions. Reduced winter snow cover can, in contrast,\ndecrease the chance of flooding arising from the combination of rainfall and rapid snowmelt. Rapid melting of\nglaciers and snow in a warming climate is already increasing river flow in some regions, but as the volumes of ice\ndiminish, flows will peak and then decline in the future. Flooding is also affected by changes in the management\nof the land and river systems. For example, clearing forests for agriculture or building cities can make rainwater\nflow more rapidly into rivers or low-lying areas. On the other hand, increased extraction of water from rivers can\nreduce water levels and the likelihood of flooding.</td>
