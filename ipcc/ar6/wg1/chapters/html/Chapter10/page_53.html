At the regional scale, a&#160;simple ensemble average with such sample sizes does not provide robust estimates of the response patterns to external forcing (Maher et&#160;al., 2019; Deser et&#160;al., 2020). Since AR5, pattern filtering methods such as signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal functions (Ting et&#160;al., 2009) have been shown to improve the identification of forced response patterns when few model members are available (Wills et&#160;al., 2020). Using SMILEs as a&#160;test bed, it has been shown that pattern filtering strongly reduces the number of ensemble members needed to estimate the forced response pattern compared to simple ensemble averaging. Pattern filtering allows the identification of low signal-to-noise signals such as the El Ni&#241;o-like response to volcanic eruptions (Khodri et&#160;al., 2017; Wills et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.7" top="450.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="450.6" x1="304.7" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 64.08; y0: 450.6; y1: 460.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Methods to extract the response to external forcing in an observed or simulated single realization include dynamical adjustment (Smoliak et&#160;al., 2015; Deser et&#160;al., 2016; Sippel et&#160;al., 2019) and time scale separation methods (DelSole et&#160;al., 2011; Wills et&#160;al., 2018, 2020). Dynamical adjustment seeks to isolate changes in surface air temperature or precipitation that are due purely to atmospheric circulation changes. The residual can then be analysed and attributed to internal changes in both land or ocean surface conditions and the thermodynamical response to external forcing. Smoliak et&#160;al. (2015) performed their dynamical adjustment using partial least squares regression of temperature to remove variations arising from sea level pressure changes. Deser et&#160;al. (2016) used constructed atmospheric circulation analogues and resampling to estimate the dynamical contribution to changes in temperature. Sippel et&#160;al. (2019) used machine learning techniques known as regularized linear regression to provide estimates of circulation-induced components of precipitation and temperature variability from global to local scales. It is noteworthy that the dynamical adjustment method by itself cannot account for the component of the forced response associated with circulation changes that project onto atmospheric internal variability. However, this component can be estimated within a&#160;model framework by averaging the dynamical contribution across multiple members of a&#160;SMILE (Deser et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="162.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="162.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Dynamical adjustment methods have been used by, for instance, Deser et&#160;al. (2016), Saffioti et&#160;al. (2016), O&#8217;Reilly et&#160;al. (2017), Gong et&#160;al. (2019), and R. Guo et&#160;al. (2019). Deser et&#160;al. (2016) focused on the causes of observed and simulated multi-decadal trends in North American temperature. They demonstrated that the main advantage of this technique is to narrow the spread of temperature trends found by the model ensemble and to bring the dynamically-adjusted observational trend much closer to the forced response estimated by the model ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained by Saffioti et&#160;al.

Over Europe, summer temperature anomalies induced thermodynamically by the warm phase of the AMV are further reinforced by circulation anomalies; meanwhile, precipitation signals are largely controlled by dynamical responses to the AMV. Based on a&#160;partial least-squares approach, Gong et&#160;al. (2019) showed that recent winter temperature 30-year trends over northern East Asia are strongly influenced by internal variability linked to decadal changes of the Arctic Oscillation. Using dynamical adjustment purely on precipitation observations, R. Guo et&#160;al. (2019) showed that human influence has led to increased winter precipitation across north-eastern North America, as well as a&#160;small region of north-western North America, and to an increase in precipitation across much of north-western and north central Eurasia. The latter results confirm previous findings obtained by standard optimal fingerprinting methods (Wan et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="498.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="498.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Time scale separation methods such as the low-frequency component analysis and ensemble empirical mode decomposition methods take advantage of the longer time scale associated with anthropogenic external forcing compared to that of most internal modes of variability. The low-frequency component analysis method tries to find low-frequency variability patterns by searching for linear combinations of a&#160;moderate number of empirical orthogonal functions that maximize the ratio of low-frequency to total variance. It has first been used to separate internal modes of interannual and decadal variability from slowly varying and externally-forced variability in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (Wills et&#160;al., 2018, 2019). The methodology has also been applied to patterns of observed surface air temperature to isolate the slow components of observed changes that are consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing (Wills et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="306.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="306.6" x1="563.25" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (Wu and Huang, 2009; Wilcox et&#160;al., 2013; Ji et&#160;al., 2014; Qian and Zhou, 2014) decomposes data, such as time series of historical temperature and precipitation, into independent oscillatory modes of decreasing frequency. The last step of the method leaves behind a&#160;smooth and low-frequency residual time series. Typically, the non-linear anthropogenic trend (e.g.,&#160;of 20th-century temperature) can be reconstructed by summing the long-term mean, the residual, and eventually the lowest-frequency mode to account for a&#160;multi-decadal forced signal, for instance associated with anthropogenic aerosol forcing. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method is an example of a&#160;data-driven, non-parametric approach that can be used to directly provide an estimate of the forced response without the need for model data (Qian, 2016).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="523.2" top="126.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.48" x1="523.2" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 126.48; y1: 136.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.1.3 Other Regional-scale Attribution Approaches</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="102.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="102.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The univariate detection method does not use spatial pattern information, but compares observed trends in gridded datasets with distributions of trends from ensembles of simulations during the historical period (Knutson et&#160;al., 2013; Knutson and Zeng, 2018).
