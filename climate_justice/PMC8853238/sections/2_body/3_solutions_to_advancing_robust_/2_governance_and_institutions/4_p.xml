Policy instruments like clean energy and renewable portfolio standards can be discussed in terms of economic development, which may encourage conservative state governments to act (Carley and Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>). For instance, Texas was an early adopter of a modest RPS (compared to today&#8217;s standards) that yielded significant early gains in wind energy development that also facilitated economic growth (Slattery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2011</xref>).</p>
