<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0100">The book concludes with a dispatch from San Francisco&#8217;s South Bay Salt Pond restoration project, an attempt to return the former salt ponds to their natural state of being an estuary. Documenting the attempt to return the salt ponds to their natural coastal wetland state highlights the destruction that was caused by human engineering, and the even greater feat of engineering needed to undo all of that engineering. The book ends with Rush describing how &#8220;organized retreat is one of the few adaptive strategies that feels appropriately humble and&#8230; acknowledges the scale of the threat.&#8221; (p. 249). Organized retreat, as Rush describes it, involves having the government pay for communities to move en masse away from climate sensitive regions, and stay together as a community in a new location. Coupled with new investments in infrastructure and government support, organized retreat presents the opportunity to allow for coastal wetlands and marshes to return to their natural state, protect our coasts, and sequester excess carbon from our atmosphere.</p>
