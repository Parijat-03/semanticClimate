<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Using a university&#8208;designed online system, we invited students enrolled in this course to participate in surveys that asked them to describe their perceptions of climate change. In both semesters, students received an invitation to take the survey before the course module on climate change and again after the course module was completed. In the first semester, the premodule survey invitation was sent mid&#8208;semester and the postmodule survey invitation was sent near the end of the semester. In the second semester, invitations were sent at the beginning of the semester and again at the end of the semester. Students who completed the premodule or postmodule surveys received extra credit.</p>
