They perceived that our personal politics aligned and assumed that we would be on the same side of the issue (opposition to the project), which may have led them to express their opinions more candidly. I found it slightly more challenging to access the opinions of public housing residents, since they were less frequent attendees of public events and could perceive me as an outsider &#8211; a non-resident of the neighborhood who appears white and attends a nearby private university. This may have affected the type of information that public housing residents revealed to me. Nonetheless, I believe being a native Spanish-speaker helped build rapport during events with Spanish-speaking participants, many living in public housing. This difference in access across groups highlights the importance of complementing information gathered through interviews with observations of how people act and speak in public events.</p>
