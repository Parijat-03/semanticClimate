There is serious doubt whether legislation which merely allows, but does not encourage, two private parties&#8211;unions and employers&#8211;to agree to union security provisions constitutes sufficient government action to implicate the First Amendment (Slater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>Janus</italic> majority emphasized the difference between the private sector and public sector (<italic>Janus</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>, 2458). But in the earlier case of <italic>Harris v. Quinn</italic>, as Professor Joseph Slater has pointed out, the majority seemed open to the argument that private sector union security agreements violate the First Amendment (Slater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>, 62&#8211;63). There is no doubt that the funders of the lawsuits that eliminated public sector union security will make every possible effort to eliminate union security in the private sector as well, whether through litigation or legislation.</p>
