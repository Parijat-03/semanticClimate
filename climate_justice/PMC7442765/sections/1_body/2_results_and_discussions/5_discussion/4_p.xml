<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par48">For the T = 100 year lake levels in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>, considerable variations in the magnitudes of the lake levels can also be seen in all three models. These range from a maximum of 477.9 m ASVD (AMS<sub>2</sub>) to a minimum of 476.1 m ASVD (AMS<sub>1</sub>). In addition, AMS<sub>1</sub> has quantiles above the stationary 100-year levels for approximately 18% of the time, whereas AMS<sub>2</sub> and AMS<sub>3</sub> account for 50% and 60% of the time, respectively. It can also be noted that AMS<sub>3</sub> quantiles exhibit the most changes for the T = 100-year lake levels.</p>
