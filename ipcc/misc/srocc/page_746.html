This could minimise ecological costs and maximise synergies with other development goals under climate change (Poff et al. 2003; Winemiller et al. 2016). Furthermore, the adoption of metrics based on the emerging concept of Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People (NCP) under the IPBES framework brings in non-economic instruments and values that, in combination with conventional valuation of ES approaches, could elicit greater support for non-consumptive water use of rivers for achieving SDG goals (De Groot et&#160;al. 2010; Pascual et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="240.07" top="483.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 483.42; y1: 493.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="483.42" x1="240.07">7.5.6.5 Considering synergies and trade-offs to&#160;avoid&#160;maladaptation</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="447.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 447.52; y1: 457.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="447.52" x1="307.58">Coherent policies that consider synergies and trade-offs can also reduce the likelihood of maladaptation, which is the opposite of sustainable adaptation (Magnan et al. 2016).

AR5 recognised that maladaptation arises not only from inadvertent, badly planned adaptation actions, but also from deliberate decisions where wider considerations place greater emphasis on short-term outcomes ahead of longer-term threats, or that discount, or fail to consider, the full range of interactions arising from planned actions (Noble et&#160;al.&#160;2014).</span></div><div left="59.52" right="307.56" top="231.55"><span style="x0: 59.52; x1: 63.74; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.52" y0="231.55" x1="307.56">Some maladaptations are only beginning to be recognised as we become aware of unintended consequences of decisions. An example prevalent across many countries is irrigation as an adaptation to water scarcity. During a drought from 2007&#8211;2009 in California, farmers adapted by using more groundwater, thereby depleting groundwater elevation by 15 metres. This volume of groundwater depletion is unsustainable environmentally and also emits GHG emissions during the pumping (Christian-Smith et al. 2015). Despite the three years of drought, the agricultural sector performed &#64257;nancially well, due to the groundwater use and crop insurance payments. Drought compensation programmes through crop insurance policies may reduce the incentive to shift to lower water-use crops, thereby perpetuating the maladaptive situation. Another example of maladaptation that may appear as adaptation to drought is pumping out groundwater and storing in surface </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.09" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 320.68; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="735.57" x1="566.09">farm ponds, with consequences for water justice, inequity and sustainability (Kale 2017). These examples highlight the potential for maladaptation from farmers&#8217; adaptation decisions as well as the unintended consequences of policy choices; the examples illustrate the &#64257;ndings of Barnett and O&#8217;Neill (2010) that maladaptation can include: high opportunity costs (including economic, environmental, and social); reduced incentives to adapt (adaptation measures that reduce incentives to adapt by not addressing underlying causes); and path dependency or trajectories that are dif&#64257;cult to change.</span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.1" top="615.59"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 320.34; y0: 615.59; y1: 625.09; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="615.59" x1="566.1">In practice, maladaptation is a speci&#64257;c instance of policy incoherence, and it may be useful to develop a framework in designing policy to avoid this type of trade-off. This would specify the type, aim and target audience of an adaptation action, decision, project, plan, or policy designed initially for adaptation, but actually at high risk of inducing adverse effects, either on the system in which it was developed, or another connected system, or both. The assessment requires identifying system boundaries, including temporal and geographical scales at which the outcomes are assessed (Magnan 2014; Juhola et al. 2016). National-level institutions that cover the spectrum of sectors affected, or enhanced collaboration between relevant institutions, is expected to increase the effectiveness of policy instruments, as are joint programmes and funds (Morita and Matsumoto 2018).</span></div><div left="318.04" right="563.81" top="435.61"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 323.49; y0: 435.61; y1: 445.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.04" y0="435.61" x1="563.81">As new knowledge about trade-offs and synergies amongst land-climate processes emerges regionally and globally, concerns over emerging risks and the need for planning policy responses grow.
