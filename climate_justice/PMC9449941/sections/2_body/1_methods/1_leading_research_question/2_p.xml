In short: no decision&#8212;no transition. However, a key question for political decision-makers is which decisions should be taken to reach sustainability goals, considering both the intended and unintended effects against the background of alternative decisions which may reach the same transition target, but show different impact consequences. This is no easy task, since the assessment of future-oriented pathways is based on an array of hypothetical ex ante assumptions and uncertainties in the area of anticipating future knowledge for socio-technical systems.</p>
