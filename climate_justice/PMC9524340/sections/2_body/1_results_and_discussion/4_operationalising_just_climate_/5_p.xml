These are comprehensive metrics to monitor and evaluate the justice and equity impacts of climate plans and policies (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Unlike equity tools that provide broad guidelines to assess the consequences of climate programs, justice indicators enable cities to quantitatively measure the benefits and costs that climate policies bring to vulnerable populations and to track their progress toward their justice goals. For instance, the city of San Diego developed a &#8220;Climate Equity Index&#8221; to identify vulnerable communities across the city and measure the equity impacts of its climate policies over time. The index integrates over 30 standardised indicators covering multiple environmental, housing, mobility, socioeconomic, and health factors that are used to calculate a climate equity score for each of the census tracks within the city.</p>
