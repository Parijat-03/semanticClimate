These include governments and businesses adopting full costing of environmental externalities and natural capital accounting, along with regulations to underpin fit-for-purpose sustainability principles to guide financial and investment decisions. Such efforts are rapidly gaining traction with key financial actors, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD)<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn"><sup>&#8224;</sup></xref> and incipient sister Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn"><sup>&#8225;</sup></xref> Current direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry totaled US$320 billion in 2019,<xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn"><sup>&#167;</sup></xref> with a cost to society exceeding US$5 trillion annually when their social and environmental externalities are included.<xref rid="fn5" ref-type="fn"><sup>||</sup></xref> These subsidies must be replaced by policy measures guiding sustainable investments, such as a global price on carbon aligned with the latest estimates of the social cost of carbon of more than 100 US$ per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>.
