<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0060">In line with findings in other reviews, we find that the way co-production is applied and defined varies (<xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Norstr&#246;m et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Bremer and Meisch, 2017</xref>). There is no systematic alignment between variants of co-production and participatory approaches and subfields of adaptation research (adaptation in agriculture, urban planning, water management, forestry, etc.). All the reviewed articles applied co-production in a normative, prescriptive sense (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Bremer and Meisch, 2017</xref>). Co-production is applied in approaches arguing for transdisciplinarity, which is particularly evident in literature that places adaptation in the context of sustainability sciences (e.g., <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we find that co-production tends to be mentioned or applied in literature about transformation to sustainability, where adaptation is one of several core issues (<xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Sterling et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>; Baum et al., 2021).</p>
