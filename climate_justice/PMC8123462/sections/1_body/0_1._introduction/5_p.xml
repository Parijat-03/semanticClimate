A &#8216;social inequities in health&#8217; approach offers a way to understand how processes and relationships of structural inequities and institutionalized forms of exclusion and marginalization can lead to climate change disproportionately impacting a range of equity-deserving groups of children and youth. Necessarily, as the evidence for this complex interplay of social, environmental, and health factors cannot be studied easily within a laboratory setting, researchers must bring together novel mixed-methods approaches, particularly in contexts where equity-informed data are missing, and the living experiences of equity-deserving groups have been underreported. Culturally sensitive data are of key importance, as they highlight differences in experience and impact&#8212;in particular in the Canadian context, for Indigenous peoples.</p>
