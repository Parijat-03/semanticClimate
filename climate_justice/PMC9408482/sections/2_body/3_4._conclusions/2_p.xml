<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Interestingly, public health is the least coded category among all the needs categories. It shows fewer coding references related to health in their NDC submissions. Is it fair to consider health the least important component to mention in NDCs in the climate change scenario? It might be the most desperately needed category worth mentioning in NDCs, with synergic needs such as climate finance and technology; however, this study objectively visualizes the hierarchy of need strands according to the number of references/codes available in the NDCs. Another critical viewpoint is that the countries that are requiring assistance in capacity-building need assessment due to a lack of technical expertise, so on what basis are they requiring climate funds if they do not have the expertise to assess their needs or to utilize the required funds for the purpose they are looking for?</p>
