<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par6">With climate scientists agreeing that serious climate disruptions are already here or under way, while stressing that worse scenarios can and should still be prevented, a consensus has emerged about the need for both mitigation and adaptation in response to climate change (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>). Many argue that the two should not just be addressed simultaneously, but that they can even be advanced with mutual benefits (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>). For instance, cases of urban &#8216;greening&#8217; can address flooding and heat island problems (adaptation) while drawing CO2 from the atmosphere (mitigation). However, neither adaptation nor mitigation can be achieved entirely through such synergetic interventions. This introduces an opportunity cost, as choices must thus be made regarding the attribution of limited resources. Such dilemmas are particularly salient where measures to mitigate or adapt are mutually detrimental. Seawalls, for instance, have considerable carbon footprints. Hence, while governments like to propagate win&#8211;win scenarios in response to climate change, these are available only sometimes.</p>
