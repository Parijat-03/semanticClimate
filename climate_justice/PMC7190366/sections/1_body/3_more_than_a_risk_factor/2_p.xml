It is a totalising event that will, according to WHO&#8217;s quantitative risk assessment, cause an additional 250&#8201;000 deaths between 2030 and 2050.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This figure is an underestimate because of the limited number of health conditions reviewed&#8212;malaria, heat exposure in elderly people, diarrhoea, and childhood undernutrition. Food insecurity, for example, could account for a further 529&#8201;000 adult deaths by 2050.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
