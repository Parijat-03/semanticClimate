The experience of the PAPAM/ASAP program in Mali illustrates this. The project was funded by IFAD through a loan of US$40 million and an Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme grant of US$9.9 million. The ASAP grant funded a participatory mapping exercise which resulted in the development of 30 municipal adaptation plans (PCA) identifying priority adaptation actions based on analysis of vulnerabilities and ecosystem conditions. The municipalities were given direct responsibilities and financial support for the implementation of the plans (IFAD,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019b</xref>).</p>
