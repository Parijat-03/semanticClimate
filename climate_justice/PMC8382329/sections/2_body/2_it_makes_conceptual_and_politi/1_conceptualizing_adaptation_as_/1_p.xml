An inherent feature of climate change is its global dimension, both in its <italic>cause</italic> and <italic>effect</italic>: diffuse sources of emissions create differing impacts across regions. Accumulated emissions of yesteryears are mixing with the increasing emissions of today. To stay within the remaining carbon budget consistent with the Paris goal of 1.5 &#176;C, the world has to reduce carbon emissions by 33-50% by 2030 (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>). Against this aspiration, emissions keep rising, reaching 59 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2019 (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2020</xref>).</p>
