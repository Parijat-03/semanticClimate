<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">[TERM NOT USED - Term name change to ''Long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) in WGI report]<br>A set of well-mixed <em>greenhouse gases</em> with long atmospheric lifetimes.</p>
<p>This set of compounds includes <em>carbon dioxide (CO2)</em> and <em>nitrous oxide (N2O)</em>, together with some fluorinated gases. They have a warming effect on <em>climate</em>. These compounds accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial timescales, and their effect on climate hence persists for decades to centuries after their emission. On timescales of decades to a century already emitted emissions of long-lived climate forcers can only be abated by greenhouse gas removal (GGR).</p>
