<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par19">Universal in scope, the PA states that, &#8220;climate change is a common concern of humankind&#8221; (PA, preamble). The SDGs address &#8220;the human race&#8221; as a whole by stating the &#8220;critical importance for humanity and the planet&#8221; of SD (SDGs, preamble). The Encyclical seeks to &#8220;enter into dialogue with all people about our common home&#8221; (Enc., 3). All three texts thus relate macro-level entities to universalistic ethical norms and pleas for global frames, such as concern, justice, and commitment. Regarding their scope, the macro-level entities and norms are equally universal and holistic in the three texts. Humanity and the entire planet Earth are the macro-level parameters of normativity in all three documents, while techno-science dominates the PA and the SDGs; metaphysical ethics prevails in the Encyclical. However, the documents differ in the way they interconnect macro-level norms.</p>
