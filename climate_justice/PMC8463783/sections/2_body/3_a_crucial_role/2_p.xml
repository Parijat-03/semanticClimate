The latest evidence is not encouraging. The land carbon sink has shown increasing interannual variability since the 1950s, indicating rising instability in the land&#8211;atmosphere carbon exchange (<italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). More than 75% of the land surface has been altered by humans, removing 50% of vegetation biomass, whereas less than 5% of the oceans remain free from our interference (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Yet to date, the world&#8217;s relatively intact ecosystems and forested areas have not only proved remarkably resilient to climate change but have also increased the overall land carbon sink in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels&#8212;most notably the northern hemisphere forests (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
