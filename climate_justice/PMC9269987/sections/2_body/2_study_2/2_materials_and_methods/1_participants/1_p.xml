Parallel quota ratios regarding the distribution of the German population for gender and age were set. We also applied the same exclusion criteria as in Study 1. Consequently, <italic>n</italic> = 121 participants were excluded due to the RSI (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Leiner, 2019</xref>), and <italic>n</italic> = 99 due to potential socially desirable responses (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Satow, 2012</xref>).</p>
