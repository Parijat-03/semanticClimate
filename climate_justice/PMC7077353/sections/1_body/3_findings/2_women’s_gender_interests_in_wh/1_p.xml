<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The gender interests of women in wheat&#8211;maize innovations vary by socio-economic position and cultural norms. Middle-income Muslim women do not work on field crops. However, they want to be able to discuss agricultural innovations knowledgeably with their husbands and to make decisions together. They have a vested interest because innovation costs money and thus has the potential to impact negatively &#8211; or positively &#8211;the family budget. Whilst in such families men are expected to earn, effective household budgeting is considered a core management responsibility for women. Women argued that if they were able to participate in training on wheat and maize and thus understand the costs and potential financial benefits of the innovations involved, they could help to &#8220;improve their household&#8217;s position&#8221;.</p>
