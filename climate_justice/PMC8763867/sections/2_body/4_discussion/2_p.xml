While Dr. Ganz's framework has been used to teach community organizing in a variety of settings, including to health professionals,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to our knowledge it had not yet been used as a method for training medical residents early in their careers. By targeting incoming interns, this workshop captured the unique impact that public narrative can have on professional identity for those who are still developing as physician advocates. Furthermore, while advocacy curricula are increasingly being incorporated into graduate medical education, they are not standardized, the majority are not cross-institutional, and we are not aware of any that utilize community organizing skills.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> By utilizing Dr. Ganz's well-established pedagogy, this workshop features a curriculum that is readily reproducible at other centers.</p>
