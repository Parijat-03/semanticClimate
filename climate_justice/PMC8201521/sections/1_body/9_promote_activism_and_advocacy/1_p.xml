In August 2018 Greta Thunberg began protesting in front of the Swedish parliament, holding a sign that read &#8220;Skolstrejk f&#246;r Klimatet&#8221; (school strike for climate). The pace at which she amplified the global response to climate change was exceptional. Her solemn indignation is emblematic of a new generation of environmental activists,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> who believe that climate deniers should not be placated; antiscience groups should be exposed. Nurses in the UK and elsewhere have found resonance with this approach to activism, urging their employers to adopt ambitious policies to tackle environmental sustainability.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Activism can take many forms, including protests, petitions, and political engagement (including running for office). Nursing should not be shy about using its voice for change.</p>
