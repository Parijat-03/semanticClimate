      <td>While there is medium confidence that the projected decline in the AMOC (Section TS.2.4) will not involve an abrupt collapse\nbefore 2100, such a collapse might be triggered by an unexpected meltwater influx from the Greenland Ice Sheet. If an AMOC collapse\nwere to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in the regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the\ntropical rain belt, and could result in weakening of the African and Asian monsoons, strengthening of Southern Hemisphere monsoons,\nand drying in Europe.

      <td>Very rare extremes and compound or concurrent events, such as the 2018 concurrent heatwaves across the Northern Hemisphere, are\noften associated with large impacts. The changing climate state is already altering the likelihood of extreme events, such as decadal\ndroughts and extreme sea levels, and will continue to do so under future warming. Compound events and concurrent extremes\ncontribute to increasing probability of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes and will become more frequent with increasing global\nwarming (high confidence). Higher warming levels increase the likelihood of events unprecedented in the observational record. {9.6.4,\nBox 11.2}</td>
