As detailed below, all are calculated based on historical data from PRIMAP-hist dataset (G&#252;tschow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>):
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">For those countries that present a target in relation to a base year, the level of emissions that they will reach by 2030 is determined by applying the NDC target directly to the historical emissions data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">For countries presenting a target in relation to a business as usual (BAU) scenario, the BAU scenario presented in the NDC is transferred to the historical dataset from PIK. The NDC reduction target is applied to 2030 in this scenario. In the case of Algeria, the NDC does not present a BAU scenario, so it is calculated based on the historical emissions data, doing a linear regression between the years 2000 and 2017.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">For those countries that have a policy-based NDC and therefore do not present a quantifiable emissions reduction target, as well as for Libya, that has not submitted an (I)NDC, a BAU scenario like the one described in the previous paragraph is calculated to determine its emission by the year 2030.</p></list-item></list></p>
