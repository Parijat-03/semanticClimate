Further, the abundance and diversity of existing knowledge, which is often conflicting, inconsistent or outdated, may pose challenges on its usefulness. The situation is compounded by the low capacity of many stakeholders to assess the credibility and relevance of available knowledge. Additionally, enhanced local research capacity is essential if evidence &#8211; based policy to address climate change is to be realised. In this context, the state mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change intends to create a knowledge system that would help take actions to reduce vulnerabilities as well as take advantage of the mitigation opportunities. Strategic Knowledge on Climate change is therefore, the system of knowledge that is required by various stakeholders to respond to climate change. Information and knowledge requirements of the stakeholder groups are as diverse as the groups themselves. Consequently, the mission is cross cutting in nature and is intended to serve as a support mission for generating and providing strategic knowledge to all other thematic missions under the Delhi&#8217;s SAPCC, in consonance with the National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change. The mission not only focuses on key knowledge requirements but also on knowledge management and application. The State Government established a &#8216;Climate Change Cell&#8217; in the Department of Environment to act as a nodal agency to deal with all the issues related with Climate Change in the State. The Cell had been constituted in the year 2018 and will be the nodal agency for the Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="213.41" top="389.62"><span x0="72.02" y0="389.62" x1="213.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 389.62; y1: 401.62; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">17.1Knowledge creation </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.42" top="361.9"><span x0="72.02" y0="361.9" x1="526.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 361.9; y1: 373.9; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Creation of knowledge can stem from theory, observations, experiments and or modelling assessments. While there is plethora of information that is available in various domains, it often offers incomplete or conflicting knowledge that often does suffice for targeted action on climate change. Further there are crucial knowledge and data gaps in some research domains. Additionally, the assessments of impacts and vulnerabilities are often at the national level but not at state and district levels. A significant amount of conceptual and empirical work is required to better understand local climate impacts. Such an understanding is necessary to provide a better background for developing differentiated but linked responses to the different types of impacts. From a mitigation perspective, it is widely acknowledged that an alternative development model is necessary to embark on a low carbon development path. However, other than increasing efforts to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy there is a lack of understanding of the diverse opportunities towards a low carbon development pathway. Many existing options and opportunities are under utilized due to absence of research and analysis especially tailored to state specific social, ecological, political circumstances. In order to link experiential knowledge from policy side to scientific knowledge in the context of vulnerability assessments and to enhance the knowledge base in the state on climate risks, vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation and mitigation. </span></div></body></html>
