Underinvestment throughout the past 40 years has led to extreme staff shortages and facility overloads, which increased the death toll from COVID-19. In their paper &#8220;Crises as Catalyst: A New Social Contract Grounded in Worker Rights,&#8221; Diane F. Frey et al. recognize the devastating impacts that three intersecting crises&#8212;climate change, the pandemic, and extreme economic and social inequality&#8212;have had on workers and their families. Crises may act as catalysts, however. In this context, they argue that the recovery from COVID-19 and the related economic crisis presents opportunities for a just transition to also address climate change and extreme inequalities. In particular, they argue that the neoliberal social contract is failing workers and the planet alike, and they call for a new social contract grounded in workers&#8217; rights to decent work, to favorable conditions of work, to join and form trade unions, and to social protection. They conclude optimistically that a new transformative social contract grounded in human rights&#8212;specifically worker rights&#8212;would reduce inequalities, protect the health and livelihoods of workers and their families, and promote a sustainable future.</p>
