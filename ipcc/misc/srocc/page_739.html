SSP1 is a scenario with a broad focus on sustainability, including human development, technological development, nature conservation, globalised economy, economic convergence and early international cooperation (including moderate levels of trade). The scenario includes a peak and decline in population, relatively high agricultural yields and a move towards food produced in low-GHG emission systems (Van Vuuren et&#160;al. 2017b). Dietary change and reductions in food waste reduce agricultural demands, and effective land-use regulation enables reforestation and/or afforestation. SSP2 is a&#160;scenario in which production and consumption patterns, as well as technological development, follows historical patterns (Fricko et&#160;al. 2017). Land-based CDR is achieved through bioenergy and BECCS and, to a lesser degree, by afforestation and reforestation. SSP3 is a scenario with slow rates of technological change and limited land-use regulation. Agricultural demands are high due to material-intensive consumption and production, and barriers to trade lead to reduced &#64258;ows for agricultural goods. In SSP3, forest mitigation activities and abatement of agricultural GHG emissions are limited due to major implementation barriers such as low institutional capacities in developing countries and delays as a consequence of low international cooperation (Fujimori et&#160;al. 2017). Emissions reductions are achieved primarily through the energy sector, including the use of bioenergy and BECCS. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="179.45" top="411.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.56; y0: 411.42; y1: 421.42; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="411.42" x1="179.45">Policies in the Pathways</span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 399.52; y1: 409.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="399.52" x1="557.6">SSPs are complemented by a set of shared policy assumptions (Kriegler et&#160;al. 2014), indicating the types of policies that may be implemented in each future world.

In the real world, there are various barriers that can make policy&#160;implementation more dif&#64257;cult (Section 7.4.9).
