To unpack this youth-focused concern, a good example is the often-cited Lowy Institute annual poll (Kassam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>), which, at times, has shown a 28% gap between Australians aged 18 to 29&#160;years, and those over 30, in response to a question that asks if &#8220;Democracy is preferable to any other kind of government&#8221;. These types of findings are often reported in the media in rejectionist terms that overreads the data set and does not interrogate its context. For example, this type of finding has led to sensationalist claims in the media that &#8220;Fewer than half of Australian adults under the age of 45 actually believe in democratic government&#8221; (Hildebrand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). This type of coverage commonly is predicated on a discourse that young people are expected to perform a high degree of nativity about the political world, which, when displayed by older people, is attributed to pragmatism and experience. At the core of this is an implicit message that the status quo must be observed as a normative good.</p>
