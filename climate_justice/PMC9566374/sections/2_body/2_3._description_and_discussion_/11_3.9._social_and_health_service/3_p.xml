Interventions should also be aimed at these services to reduce their carbon footprint with respect to energy use (heating, air conditioning, water heating, ventilation, etc.), travel (patients, workers, visitors), acquisition of goods and services (medication, equipment, food, etc.), and production of residues. Likewise, adaptation measures are essential to approaching the possible overload on these services that could be produced by climate change, as well as its consequences.
