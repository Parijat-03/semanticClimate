The results showed good 12 agreement with the observed climatology, with some overestimation in the tropical North Atlantic and the 13 Caribbean, and underestimation in the tropical eastern Pacific. Fuentes-Franco et al. (2017) used the same 14 methodology &#8211; but removing the precipitation threshold &#8211;, to evaluate the occurrence of cyclonic vortices at 15 different grid intervals of 50 and 25 km. The model showed a response dependent on the specific 16 cyclogenetic zone, with greater sensitivity to physics schemes than to resolution. The parameterization of 17 ocean flows strongly influenced the frequency of estimated vortices and their intensity. However, the 18 methodology applied to assess the sensitivity to resolution could be questioned, since the same detection 19 thresholds are used for different resolutions, not taking into account the experience of previous investigations 20 (Walsh et al., 2007). 21 22 23 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 481.79; y1: 492.77; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="481.79" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.5.1.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="481.79" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 481.79; y1: 492.77; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">24 Results have been reported for this region based on the GCM outputs from CMIP3 and CMIP5, and on 25 regional projections downscaling these GCMs, using the CORDEX CAM domain or similar smaller domains 26 (Taylor et al., 2013; Vichot-Llano et al., 2019). Statistical downscaling methods of CMIP5 projections have 27 been also applied to obtain bias-adjusted regional projections (Colorado-Ruiz et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 28 2018; Vichot-Llano et al., 2019). Figure Atlas.37: summarizes the results for this region for CMIP5 and 29 CMIP6. 30 31 Global and regional models highly coincide in projecting warming in the whole region for the end of the 32 century, under scenarios A2 and B2 for CMIP3 projections and under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for CMIP5 33 projections.

The greatest warming 36 of 5.8&#176;C for the end of the century was projected for northern Mexico by Colorado-Ruiz et al. (2018) under 37 RCP8.5, using an ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs (see also Figure Atlas.37:). On the other hand, high-resolution 38 regional projections for the 2021&#8211;2050 period relative to the 1961&#8211;1990 baseline period were made by 39 Imbach et al. (2018) using the Eta regional climate model at an 8-km resolution and driven by HadGEM2-ES 40 with the RCP4.5 scenario. They projected a warming in the Central America isthmus for 2021&#8211;2050 of about 41 1.6&#176;C to 2.4&#176;C.  42 43 Much more uncertainty is found in the precipitation projections. Using the PRECIS model under the A2 and 44 B2 scenarios and for the end of the century, Karmalkar et al. (2011) projected a precipitation increase in the 45 dry season for the northern Caribbean region and a precipitation decrease for the southern Caribbean (25&#8211;46 50%). They also projected a drying of up to 35% under the A2 scenario during the wet season for the whole 47 Caribbean. 48 49 Twenty first century projections were developed by Cavazos and Arriaga-Ram&#237;rez (2012) by applying bias-50 correction and statistical downscaling methods to the projections output of six CMIP3 GCMs for the NAM 51 region and north-western Mexico. The projections showed larger interannual variations and larger 52 uncertainties for precipitation than for temperature. The A2 scenarios show the largest reductions of 53 precipitation in the last 20 years of the 21st century and a decrease of 30% is projected for Baja California 54 mainly in winter and spring, while precipitation in the NAM region is projected to decrease by 20% during 55 </span></div></body></html>
