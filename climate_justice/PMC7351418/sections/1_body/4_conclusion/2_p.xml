<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0120">While the just transition concept has gained significant traction in economic and policy circles, considerable challenges exist with regards to implementation. Obvious obstacles include the shifting and contingent dynamics of energy transitions across disparate geographical, political, and economic localities. The fact that there is no universally agreed-upon definition of or framework for just transitions presents further challenges. While in labor circles the notion of a just transition evokes solutions such as worker retraining, targeted economic development plans, and public and private investment, environmental and climate justice organizations approach just transitions more holistically and tend to emphasize support for community-level engagement and participatory governance. While there is significant overlap amongst these organizations regarding issues like sustainability and green jobs, achieving alignment and compromise will remain a necessary and ongoing task. Regional idiosyncrasies prevent further challenges. For example, solar is likely better suited than wind to replace local coal mining jobs but is not available or viable everywhere <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. As such, it is critically important to document processes, policies, and outcomes within and across organizations that have adopted just transition principles. Coalition-building and information-sharing will be critical to compare results and leverage resources locally, nationally, and globally. Likewise, as evidenced by existing just transition initiatives, community-centric, co-productive approaches to policy design and implementation in regions most impacted by the energy transition must be emphasized in tandem with other government and industry stakeholder needs.</p>
