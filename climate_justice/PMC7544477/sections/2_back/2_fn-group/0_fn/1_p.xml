Indigenous people defending never-ceded Indigenous territory may be understood as <italic>obedience</italic> to and respect for Indigenous legal traditions. Actions of land, water and earth defense require contextualization with careful discussions of circumstances, settings, the violence of (settler-)colonial law as well as consideration of Indigenous law and legal orders (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Borrows, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Napoleon, 2013</xref>).</p>
