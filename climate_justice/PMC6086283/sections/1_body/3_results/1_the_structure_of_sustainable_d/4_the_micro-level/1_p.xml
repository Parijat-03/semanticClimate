Here the PA, for instance, registers subnational entities such as &#8220;non-Party stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples&#8221; (PA, preamble). The SDGs address the same entities on the micro-level although with a stronger emphasis on inclusion compared to the PA. In contrast, the Encyclical explicitly addresses individuals guided by universal norms as the relevant actors at the micro-level.</p>
