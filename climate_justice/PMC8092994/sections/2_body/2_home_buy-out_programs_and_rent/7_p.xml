The renter also does not typically receive any financial support from the property owner or the city to relocate when a buy-out occurs. It should be noted that the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">&#167;4601</xref><italic>et seq.</italic>, provides protection and assistance for people affected by federally funded projects such as buy-outs. This law is intended to ensure that people whose real property is acquired, or who move as a result of projects receiving federal funds, are treated fairly and equitably and receive just compensation for, and assistance in moving from, the property. In a buy-out situation, the renter may be eligible for some assistance to relocate, but participation in the NFIP may be a requirement for such assistance, which raises potential barriers to access because so many renters do not have flood insurance, as noted above.</p>
