Due to financial, cultural, and a host of other factors, people in some cases participate in activities promoting deforestation and wildlife trade to support their livelihoods. Research on the effects of the Global Financial Crisis in Cameroon, for example, showed multiple effects on livelihood and biodiversity indicators.<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> Although global demand for timber products decreased, workers laid-off from the logging industry turned to poaching and slash and burn agriculture.<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> As the economy recovered in 2010&#8211;11, biodiversity indicators improved more slowly than livelihood indicators, suggesting a lag in environmental recovery following the events.<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> Understanding previous examples can help forecast and prepare for the future trajectories of environmental health recovery from COVID-19 effects. Addressing issues specific to the world's low-income and rural populations is required to prevent adverse results for these groups, and flow-on effects for the environment, which ultimately could increase the risks for zoonosis emergence in the future.</p>
