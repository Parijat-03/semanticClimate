<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In response to the coronavirus outbreak, many news outlets developed their own
data-driven predictive models and simulations to report on the possible impact of
preventive policies and health measures on case counts and mortality rates (<xref rid="bibr10-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Diakopoulos, 2022</xref>).
Readers were given the opportunity to engage with these models through exploring
different possible future outcomes and scenarios by modifying some of the underlying
assumptions and configurations of these models. Journalists have also incorporated
third-party predictive models into their news reporting (e.g. the IHME model) when
thinking about the future and imaging tradeoffs between short-term decisions and
long term effects (<xref rid="bibr9-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Colglazier
and Diakopoulos, 2022</xref>). For instance, The New York Times published an
article entitled &#8220;What 5 Coronavirus Models Say the Next Month Will Look Like&#8221;
(<xref rid="bibr5-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2020</xref>)
comparing five different predictive models forecasting case counts,
hospitalizations, and deaths and how these models are guiding current public
policies. It is evident from the title of this article that the focus of predictive
journalism is on informing the public about possible and predicted future outcomes
and how such outcomes could possibly have an impact on society.</p>
