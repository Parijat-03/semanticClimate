Considering the seven categories of environmentally relevant emotions by <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Landmann (2020)</xref>, pride is one of the <italic>self-praising emotions</italic> which occur as a result of positive norm deviations. Gratitude belongs to <italic>other-praising emotions</italic> which are triggered by observing positive norm deviations in others. Guilt and shame cover <italic>self-condemning emotions</italic> that arise due to individual violations of personal norms. These different emotion types lead to different action tendencies. Whereas self-praising emotions reinforce one&#8217;s own positive behavior, e.g., through in-group favoring pro-environmental intentions, other-praising emotions lead to support for the source of these emotions, e.g., protecting nature. Self-condemning emotions motivate people to correct their behavior, e.g., by repairing environmental damage (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Landmann, 2020</xref>).</p>
