Consider the global coronavirus pandemic. Countries that implemented state-mandated lockdowns, testing, universal mask wearing, and other measures fared far better than countries that relied on voluntary measures. Similarly, voluntary individual behavior to reduce carbon footprints is no substitute for society-wide climate policy to keep warming below 1.5 &#176;C by 2030. Personal lifestyle changes like driving less and eating less meat are still important and stepping stones to bigger actions; however, they are insufficient. Science and advocacy are both needed to combat pandemics and the climate crisis.</p>
