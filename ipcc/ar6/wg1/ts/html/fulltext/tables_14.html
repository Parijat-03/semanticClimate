Changes in temperature by latitude in response\nto multiple forcings show that polar amplification (stronger warming at high latitudes than the global average) is a prominent feature\nof the climate system across multiple climate states, and the ability of models to simulate this polar amplification in past warm\nclimates has improved since AR5 (high confidence). Over the past millennium, and especially since about 1300 CE, simulated global\nsurface temperature anomalies are well within the uncertainty of reconstructions (medium confidence), except for some short periods\nimmediately following large volcanic eruptions, for which different forcing datasets disagree (Box TS.2, Figure 2b). {2.3.1.1, 3.3.3.1,\n3.8.2.1, 7.4.4.1.2}\nProxy-based and model-simulated estimates of global surface temperature agree across multiple reference periods\n(a) (b)\n20\nGlobal surface temperature relative to 1.0 Observed Reconstructed Simulated\n1850&#8211;1900\n15 0.8 Early Eocene )C&#176;(\n0.6 erutarepmet )C&#176;(\nerutarepmet\n10\n0.4 0091&#8211;0581\n5 0.2\nmid--Pliocene ecafrus\nRecent past 0 detalumiS\n0 1850&#8211;1900 Last Interglacial mid-Holocene &#8211;0.2 labolG ot evitaler\n&#8211;0.4\n&#8211;5 Last Glacial Maximum\n&#8211;0.6\n&#8211;10\n&#8211;10 &#8211;5 0 5 10 15 20 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\nReconstructed temperature (&#176;C) Year (CE)</td>

      <td>Equilibrium climate sensitivity. Paleoclimate data provide evidence to estimate equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS ) (Section\nTS.3.2.1). In AR6, refinements in paleo data for paleoclimate reference periods indicate that ECS is very likely greater than 1.5&#176;C and\nlikely less than 4.5&#176;C, which is largely consistent with other lines of evidence and helps narrow the uncertainty range of the overall\nassessment of ECS. Some of the CMIP6 climate models that have either high (&gt;5&#176;C) or low (&lt;2&#176;C) ECS also simulate past global\nsurface temperature changes outside the range of proxy-based reconstructions for the coldest and warmest reference periods. Since\nAR5, independent lines of evidence, including proxy records from past warm periods and glacial&#8211;interglacial cycles, indicate that\nsensitivity to forcing increases as temperature increases (Section TS.3.2.2). {7.4.3.2, 7.5.3, 7.5.6, Table 7.11}</td>

      <td>Water cycle. New hydroclimate reconstructions and model-data comparisons have improved the understanding of the causes\nand effects of long-term changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, including monsoon variability and modes of variability\n(Box TS.13, Section TS.4.2). Climate models are able to reproduce decadal drought variability on large regional scales, including the\nseverity, persistence and spatial extent of past megadroughts known from proxy records (medium confidence). Some long-standing\ndiscrepancies remain, however, such as the magnitude of African monsoon precipitation during the early Holocene (the past 11,700\nyears), suggesting continuing knowledge gaps. Paleoclimate evidence shows that, in relatively high CO climates such as the Pliocene,\n2\nWalker circulation over the equatorial Pacific Ocean weakens, supporting the high confidence model projections of weakened Walker\ncells by the end of the 21st century. {3.3.2, 8.3.1.6, 8.4.1.6, 8.5.2.1, 9.2}</td>
