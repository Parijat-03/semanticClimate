Following the analysis of web content, interviews have been conducted with key projects to complement the data and better understand projects' experiences researching COVID-19. This provided valuable information about project design, characteristics, and motivations in addition to reflections of project leaders on what actions have been successful and what can be improved in the future design and development of CS projects (Turbe et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Ultimately, using mixed methods of analytics and social science provides methodological richness, allowing for the triangulation of data. That is a systematic comparison of data obtained from different sources and research perspectives which provides a coherent, validated, and holistic perspective of the CS landscape. This approach allows us to deepen our understanding about the main topics and concepts which are communicated over the web and characterize CS and the different ways it is perceived and approached by people who lead or take part in CS activities.</p>
