These include: the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in CM and MR; empirical case studies of successful CM and MR and their underpinning processes and stakeholder engagements; international and border politics on CM and MR; gender, intersectional, and environmental justice impacts of MR; land disputes and ecological effects of MR and CM; global and local politics associated with MR and CM and the intertwined nature of these politics; and human relationships with &#8216;impermanence&#8217; as a new normal. The latter implies that people may be displaced multiple times and therefore have to move multiple times. The psychological, cultural, economic and political implications of impermanence as permanent reality thus require further exploration. We call on researchers to examine these different issues. Our goal in this piece was to contribute to such efforts by presenting the distinctive elements between CM and MR and unpacking the processes that are critical to further theorizing and addressing them. We argue that clarity in terminology combined with transformative thinking and the cultivation of strategic alliances can contribute to an agenda setting and targeted policies for creating a more just future.</p>
