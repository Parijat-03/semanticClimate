Isolation centres and testing capacity for the disease were stretched beyond their capacity as preparedness for an event of such magnitude was non-existent across most states. Key workers across federal, state, and local government agencies were vulnerable socially, physically, and economically, due to the lack of adequate measures to protect them whilst serving the populace. This gap was more pronounced with COVID-19; however, it brings to the fore the need to build capacities and resilience across the health sector for emergency and disaster situations.</p>
