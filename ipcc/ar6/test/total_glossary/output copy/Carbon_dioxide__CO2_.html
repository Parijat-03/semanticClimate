<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A naturally occurring gas, CO<sub>2</sub> is also a by-product of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning biomass, of land-use changes (LUCs) and of industrial processes (e.g., cement production). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) that affects the Earthâs radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1.</p></dd>
