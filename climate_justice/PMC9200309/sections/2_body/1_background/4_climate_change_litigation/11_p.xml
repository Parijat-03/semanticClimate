Ultimately, both public health promotion and legal reform have common aims of creating a policy landscape conducive to human well-being. The integration of a public health mandate into a new eco-centric legal paradigm will optimize its potential to promote human well-being&#8212;the core objective underpinning both international law and public health. By knowing to what degree public health has featured in the empirical arguments used to justify climate legal action to date, we can better understand how well existing eco-centric and other environmental health laws lend themselves to public health promotion. Should gaps be identified, we can begin to postulate how existing legal doctrines and practices can be enhanced to increase the credibility of public health arguments in climate legal action and by consequence, ensure legal rulings on climate litigation have positive implications for public health.</p>
