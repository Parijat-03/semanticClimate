<p>One ugly truth is how inadequate and unfair the American health care system is; a system that amplified the pandemic in America. Those without health care or policies which have high deductibles are more likely to go to the hospital late while they continue to spread the virus to others. Worrying about being covered by insurance or having to pay exorbitant costs only increases the anxiety and torture of those battling the disease. Many of those working in the &#8216;necessary services&#8217; are low&#8208;paid and with little or no insurance coverage &#8211; food industry workers, delivery personnel, the janitors and cleaners in hospitals and stores. Many have underlying health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure making them more vulnerable. On 6 April 2020, National Public Radio (NPR) reported that 72% of the COVID&#8208;19 cases in Chicago are African American, while they make up only 30% of the city&#8217;s population. The mythical dimension is Hermes as the god of servants; the support staff in our societies. He comes to this role as god of the unseen and invisible that provide the working foundations of a person and a society, a role many &#8216;illegal immigrants&#8217; fill in America. Society is now recognizing the importance of the invisibles by their high priority for getting the vaccines.</p>
