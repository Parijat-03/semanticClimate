<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This study has several limitations. First, its findings are based on a small and highly selective sample that, nevertheless, was reasonably characteristic of the population of students engaged in collective action for climate justice. In addition, the interaction between interviewer and interviewee was determined by social dynamics that may have influenced the responses. Thus, qualitative data from interviews were not immune to socially desired responses. Moreover, the qualitative content analysis can be viewed critically, as it may have overlooked important issues and may have come to inaccurate conclusions. Finally, the results of this work cannot be used to prove or disprove any cause-effect relationships empirically. The qualitative, partly retrospective survey method, which is not protected from socially desirable responses, cannot exclude the effect of confounding variables on the transformation of psychological conditions.</p>
