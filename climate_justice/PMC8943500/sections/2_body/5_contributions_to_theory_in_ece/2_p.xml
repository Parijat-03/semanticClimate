Drawing on Cultural Historical Activity Theory and the concept of ontological Communities of Learners, they describe ways in which community-based characteristics of the preschools shape and are shaped by cultural tools used to pursue ECEfS. Themed Project Work (TPW) is described as an important practice through which to examine questions of community within and across preschools.</p>
