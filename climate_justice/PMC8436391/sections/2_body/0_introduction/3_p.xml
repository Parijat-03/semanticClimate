<p>The broader context of our paper is a contemporary one: the global pandemic. While we
acknowledge the complexity of the global, regional and local forces that underlie and propel
significant practice challenges, our focus is to seek opportunities in this COVID-19
&#8216;interruption&#8217; to prepare social work students for changing conditions and revisit
some long-standing questions that re-surface in these times. Attuning social work education to
current conditions begins with key themes that are emerging in contemporary international
scholarship around a changing climate, governance (the dominant neoliberal discourse and
authoritarian regimes/conflict and intrusions), technologies for the future, the critical
circumstances of a global pandemic and the interconnections between these themes. This
scholarship articulates urgent and substantial challenges facing both social work and community
development (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Ife, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Fong <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Kenny, 2020</xref>).</p>
