<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Abs1"><p id="Par3">This chapter notes the efforts of implementing a climate change curriculum within the Harvard Graduate School of Education that helps to build competencies for potential leaders in different education sectors so that they can collaboratively&#160;combat climate change. Literature points out the fruitful and productive partnerships of grassroots initiatives with large scale institutions and/or government organizations. The authors explore the conception of a climate change&#160;curriculum with explicit content knowledge and thoughtful&#160;pedagogy, designed&#160;by students and supported by faculty. The authors examine the design elements of the curriculum&#160;and then specify the implementation process of a curriculum at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). The authors draw out the limitations and implications of &#8220;students as partners&#8221; in the co-creation of learning and teaching in the field of sustainable development education&#160;within higher education institutions.</p></abstract>
