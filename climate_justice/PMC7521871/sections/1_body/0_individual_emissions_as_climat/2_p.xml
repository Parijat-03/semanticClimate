<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0025">The Paris Agreement lays out a framework for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to reach climate change mitigation goals (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">UNFCCC, 2015</xref>). The Agreement considers CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on nations, sub-national entities, and sectors (e.g. transportation, land use change, and energy) (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Bhowmik et al., 2020</xref>). However, considering emissions by sector alone could abscond the more complex nature of individual contributions and create climate justice issues as specific reduction targets for individuals are notably absent (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Higham, Ellis, &amp; Maclaurin, 2019</xref>). In addition, most public messaging efforts for climate change mitigation are broadly framed as a collective action issue; if each person would do their part and change their lifestyle, progress could be made (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Higham et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Adger, 2003</xref>). However, research on the distribution of emissions shows that generally the top 10% of individual emitters are responsible for up to 50% of total emissions (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Bel and Rosell, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Brand and Boardman, 2008</xref>). Given that emissions are highly correlated with income (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boucher, 2017</xref>), framing mitigation as a class struggle is increasingly necessary to mark the difference between subsistence and luxury emissions (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Schlosberg, 2019</xref>). In this light, the mitigation movement needs to address the individuals who are making the greatest contributions to climate change.</p>
