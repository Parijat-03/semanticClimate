In this respect, Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] argued that the limited sectoral and technological resolution of emission scenarios applied for setting SBTs is problematic. The authors found that this particularly hampers the applicability of the SDA method to construction companies and other complex sectors that produce heterogenous, long-lived products that interact with other companies and actors. Likewise, Walenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] called for more attention to the lack of SBTs in oil and gas and agriculture.</p>
