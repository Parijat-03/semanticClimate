As per Census 2011, it has a population of 1.67 crore (16.7 million). With a density of 11.297 persons per sq. Km. It is India&#8217;s second largest urban agglomeration after Mumbai. Delhi is expected to be highly prone to the consequences of climate change because of its sensitive geo-ecological set-up, strategic location, presence of the mountain ranges, transboundary river systems, inhabitation of ecosystem by people of different ethnic groups and inherent socio-economic differences.  Given the fact that it is the capital of the country, Delhi needs to prepare a climate change adaptation and mitigation plan integrated with the strategic developmental plan to be a showcase. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="285.77" top="549.0"><span x0="72.02" y0="549.0" x1="285.77" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 549.0; y1: 561.0; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3.1Location, Geography and Climate </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.41" top="521.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="521.28" x1="508.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 521.28; y1: 533.28; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi is located in northern India between the latitudes of 28&#176;-24&#8217;-17&#8221; and 28&#176;-53&#8217;-00&#8221; North and longitudes of 76&#176;-50&#8217;-24&#8221; and 77&#176;-20&#8217;-37&#8221; East.
