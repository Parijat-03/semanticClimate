Our study is of a single extreme weather event in a single location, and we are agnostic as to the external validity of our findings. Is our work generalizable to other hazards, such as primarily riverine flooding or wildfires, or to other locations? The only way to answer this question is with more such studies, of more hazards, in more locations. This single-event and single location characteristic of our work can also be perceived as an advantage, as it provides a specific causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and very specific harms. Indeed, we identify harms to specific residential properties. As noted in a recent analysis of the role of event attribution and the law, &#8220;one critical question for courts&#8230;is to what extent observational evidence of local impacts&#8230;can be used to support claims of injury in the absence of an attribution study of a matching geographic and temporal scope showing that the observed impact was caused by anthropogenic influence on climate change&#8221; (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, p. 235). Our study provides exactly this missing link, in as much as it &#8220;supports claims of injury&#8221; for specific properties, after a specific event. As such, our study does not only document the inequalities associated with climate change impacts. In the methodology we developed, it also provides a tool that can assist in redressing these inequalities by assigning clearer chains of causality, and consequently, liability.</p>
