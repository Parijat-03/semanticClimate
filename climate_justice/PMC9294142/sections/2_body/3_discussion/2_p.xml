First, we reiterate the recommendation from Rosentraub (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) that in stadium or arena anchored urban redevelopment, planning must be large in scale and purposeful, with a combination of both public and private funding and input, as opposed to an expectation that an urban area requiring revitalization will occur over time organically. Rosentraub's (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) recommendation also extends to environmental sustainability&#8212;it must include strategic planning for long term successful outcomes.</p>
