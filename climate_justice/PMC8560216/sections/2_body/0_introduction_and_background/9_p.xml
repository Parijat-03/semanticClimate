Thus, in the extended and conversational interview format of a podcast, complex issues can be given the time and depth needed. Supporting social media and additional information can also help present multi-faceted, interdisciplinary topics. Podcasts can use &#8220;conversation as a mode of inquiry&#8221; (Barrios-O&#8217;Neill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>, p. 151). The <italic>Breaking Green Ceilings</italic> (BGC) podcast&#8217;s themes demonstrate how environmental issues are interconnected with racial, cultural, social, economic, and political issues and that historically underrepresented communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change, environmental degradation, and loss of biodiversity. This article presents the steps taken to launch the BGC podcast and topics covered in the first year of the podcast, as well as future directions and goals for the show.</p>
