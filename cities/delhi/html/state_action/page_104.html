Other sources of water supply include sub surface sources like Ranney wells and tube wells. Though, the average water available to Delhi is approximately 225 lpcd, however total number of active consumers which were around 19.20 lakh as on 01.04.2015 has increased to 21.66 lakh. Due to the unequal distribution a large population remains without having an access to supply water and depends heavily on groundwater resources. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.35" top="278.74"><span x0="72.02" y0="278.74" x1="508.35" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 278.74; y1: 290.74; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Groundwater contributes about 10% of total production. However, inadequate reserves and the increasing demand due to rapid urbanization have resulted in unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) assessed the total groundwater potential to be 280 million cubic meters (MCM) in 2008 as compared to 428.07 MCM in 1983 showing an overdraft and reduction of around 150 MCM over the past few years. Reduction in recharge of aquifers due to infrastructure development, demand by industrial and domestic sectors, runoff getting diverted into the sewers or storm water drains that convey the water into the river Yamuna and unplanned withdrawal from the sub soil aquifers have put tremendous stress on the groundwater resources. </span></div></body></html>
