Benzie and Persson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>) argue that in the initial years, the then epistemic community looked at climate impacts from a narrow environmental science perspective and so the Convention codified adaptation at a local/national scale, with the predominant focus given to mitigation. They also present cases of &#8220;borderless climate risks,&#8221; which may be experienced locally, but have cross-border, even global repercussions, as indirect impacts (Hedlund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>). So the framing of adaptation is being expanded by multidisciplinary thinking from national to the global level, requiring international cooperation and multi-stakeholder engagement (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>; Dzebo and Stripple <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>; Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p>
