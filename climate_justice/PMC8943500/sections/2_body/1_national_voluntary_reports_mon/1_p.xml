At the annual UNESCO High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, some of these reports are in focus for the discussion (for information on the 2021 forum, please go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf/2021">https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf/2021</ext-link>). The latest report from Sweden (Government offices of Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>) showed a broad holistic review of Swedish national policy for the whole society, including lessons learned, development and challenges since the last report in 2017. A central focus has been put on children and youth, describing consequences for children linked to each of the 17 UNSDGs. In 2020, the UNCRC got the status of National Swedish law, which strengthens the children&#8217;s position. However, the review states that &#8220;economic and social inequalities are not decreasing. Many of the national environmental objectives, including climate targets, will not be met. Violence and abuse are not decreasing, and more children are subjected to bullying&#8221; (Government offices of Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>, p. 12).</p>
