For instance, if we assume that an HDI of 0.8 (labelled &#8216;Very high&#8217; by the UN), which requires roughly 100 GJ per capita, is an adequate proxy for the capabilities relevant for HDI, then, as a matter of global justice, levels should be raised for A, B, and C being entitled to increased energy availability. Raising C, rather than A or B, is consistent with Pogge&#8217;s criticism of the incentives that HDI provides (2002). Given that the GJ per capita is raised for C, Scenario II would be a distribution more consistent with the CA, assuming that the HDI of C is also raised.</p>
