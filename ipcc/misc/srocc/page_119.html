At the same time the land surface interacts with the overlying atmosphere, thus human modi&#64257;cations of land use, land cover and urbanisation affect global, regional and local climate. The complexity of the land&#8211;climate interactions requires multiple study approaches embracing different spatial and temporal scales. Observations of land atmospheric exchanges, such as of carbon, water, nutrients and energy can be carried out at leaf level and soil with gas exchange systems, or at canopy scale by means of micrometeorological techniques (i.e.&#160;eddy covariance). At regional scale, atmospheric measurements by tall towers, aircraft and satellites can be combined with atmospheric transport models to obtain spatial explicit maps of relevant greenhouse gases &#64258;uxes. At longer temporal scale (&gt;10 years) other approaches are more effective, such as tree-ring chronologies, satellite records, population and vegetation dynamics and isotopic studies. Models are important to bring information from measurement together and to extend the knowledge in space and time, including the exploration of scenarios of future climate&#8211;land interactions.</span></div><div left="83.48" right="121.54" top="548.7"><span style="x0: 83.48; x1: 88.57; y0: 548.7; y1: 559.7; width: 5.09; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="83.48" y0="548.7" x1="121.54">FAQ&#160;1.2 </span><span x0="121.54" y0="548.65" x1="155.99" style="x0: 121.54; x1: 123.98; y0: 548.65; y1: 559.65; width: 2.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDFC+FrutigerLTPro-Bold;">|  </span><span style="x0: 152.93; x1: 159.66; y0: 548.7; y1: 559.7; width: 6.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="152.93" y0="548.7" x1="483.97">How region-speci&#64257;c are the impacts of different land-based adaptation and mitigation options?</span></div><div left="83.48" right="554.07" top="519.33"><span style="x0: 83.48; x1: 87.35; y0: 519.33; y1: 528.83; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="83.48" y0="519.33" x1="554.07">Land-based adaptation and mitigation options are closely related to region-speci&#64257;c features for several reasons. Climate change has a&#160;de&#64257;nite regional pattern with some regions already suffering from enhanced climate extremes and others being impacted little, or even bene&#64257;ting. From this point of view increasing con&#64257;dence in regional climate change scenarios is becoming a&#160;critical step forward towards the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options. Biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change depend on the exposures of natural ecosystems and economic sectors, which are again speci&#64257;c to a&#160;region, re&#64258;ecting regional sensitivities due to governance. The overall responses in terms of adaptation or mitigation capacities to avoid and reduce vulnerabilities and enhance adaptive capacity, depend on institutional arrangements, socio-economic conditions, and implementation of policies, many of them having de&#64257;nite regional features. However global drivers, such as agricultural demand, food prices, changing dietary habits associated with rapid social transformations (i.e.&#160;urban vs rural, meat-eating vs vegetarian) may interfere with region-speci&#64257;c policies for mitigation and adaptation options and need to be addressed at the global level.</span></div><div left="83.48" right="121.54" top="384.52"><span style="x0: 83.48; x1: 88.57; y0: 384.52; y1: 395.52; width: 5.09; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="83.48" y0="384.52" x1="121.54">FAQ&#160;1.3 </span><span x0="121.54" y0="384.48" x1="155.99" style="x0: 121.54; x1: 123.98; y0: 384.48; y1: 395.48; width: 2.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDFC+FrutigerLTPro-Bold;">|  </span><span style="x0: 152.93; x1: 162.1; y0: 384.52; y1: 395.52; width: 9.16; font-size: 11.0; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="152.93" y0="384.52" x1="477.38">What is the difference between deserti&#64257;cation and land degradation?

Land degradation is a&#160;general term used to describe a&#160;negative trend in land condition caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes (including anthropogenic climate change). Degradation can be identi&#64257;ed by the long-term reduction or loss in biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans. Deserti&#64257;cation is land degradation when it occurs in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, which are also called drylands. Contrary to some perceptions, deserti&#64257;cation is not the same as the expansion of deserts. Deserti&#64257;cation is also not limited to irreversible forms of land degradation.</span></div></body></html>
