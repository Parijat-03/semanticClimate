Thus, one can see why podcasting is an attractive option for a person or a group of people who have historically been underrepresented and not featured in mainstream culture or media such as Disabled, Queer, Trans, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (DQTBIPOC) (Piepzna-Samarasinha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>). Podcasts also allow listeners to choose the time of listening and content (Markman and Sawyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>).</p>
