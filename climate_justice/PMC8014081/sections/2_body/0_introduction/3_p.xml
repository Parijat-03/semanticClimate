Nursing has a pivotal role in addressing climate change, climate justice, and health. In our institution at the MGH Institute of Health Professions School of Nursing, the first school of nursing&#8208;led Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health was established to address the deleterious health consequences of climate change and the critical need for health professions education. Literature suggests that education of all of the health professions is integral to address the leading public health challenge of our time; in health professions education curriculum development, integration of climate change knowledge in clinical practice, policy/advocacy efforts, and research and scholarship about climate and health are key areas for the future (Maxwell &amp; Blashki,&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In the midst of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, it is important to leverage both climate change and associated pandemics to address the future of public health in the 21st century. From a nursing professional lens from the International Council of Nurses, Catton (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) notes: <disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="phn12866-blkfxd-0001"><p>The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will affect health and health care, including pannational infections such as the new coronavirus, COVID&#8208;19 and others that will be related to global warming (p. 4).</p></disp-quote>
