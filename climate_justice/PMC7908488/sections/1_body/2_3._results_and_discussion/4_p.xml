However, Black populations throughout the southwestern metropolitan areas are relatively small, and even the top-decile neighborhoods still had low percentages of Black population. Salt Lake City (&lt;2.5% even for the top decile), Albuquerque (&lt;3%), and El Paso (&lt;3%) are good examples of this.</p>
