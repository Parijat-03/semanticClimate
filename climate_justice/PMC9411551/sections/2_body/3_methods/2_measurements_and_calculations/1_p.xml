Climate change-attributed depths and damages are calculated using the baseline flood scenarios described above. For each scenario, both the flooding depth and damages are subtracted from the baseline (the actual flooding that occurred) to determine the amount of flooding (in terms of depth or damages) that could be attributed to climate change. Each scenario produces two variables from these calculations: attributable flood depths (with depths below 20&#8201;cm set to 0; see above) and damages to every building.</p>
