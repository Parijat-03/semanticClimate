      <td>Global mean sea level (GMSL) increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901 to 2018, with a rate of rise\nthat has accelerated since the 1960s to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr&#8211;1 for the period 2006&#8211;2018 (high confidence). Human\nactivities were very likely the main driver of observed GMSL rise since 1971, and new observational evidence leads\nto an assessed sea level rise over the period 1901 to 2018 that is consistent with the sum of individual components\ncontributing to sea level rise, including expansion due to ocean warming and melting of glaciers and ice sheets (high\nconfidence). It is virtually certain that GMSL will continue to rise over the 21st century in response to continued\nwarming of the climate system (Box TS.4, Figure 1). Sea level responds to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions more\nslowly than global surface temperature, leading to weaker scenario dependence over the 21st century than for global\nsurface temperature (high confidence). This slow response also leads to long-term committed sea level rise, associated\nwith ongoing ocean heat uptake and the slow adjustment of the ice sheets, that will continue over the centuries and\nmillennia following cessation of emissions (high confidence) (Box TS.9). By 2100, GMSL is projected to rise by 0.28&#8211;\n0.55 m (likely range) under SSP1-1.9 and 0.63&#8211;1.01 m (likely range) under SSP5-8.5 relative to the 1995&#8211;2014 average\n(medium confidence). Under the higher CO emissions scenarios, there is deep uncertainty in sea level projections for\n2\n2100 and beyond associated with the ice-sheet responses to warming. In a low-likelihood, high-impact storyline and a\nhigh CO emissions scenario, ice-sheet processes characterized by deep uncertainty could drive GMSL rise up to about\n2\n5 m by 2150. Given the long-term commitment, uncertainty in the timing of reaching different GMSL rise levels is an\nimportant consideration for adaptation planning. {2.3, 3.4, 3.5, 9.6, Box 9.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Table 9.5}</td>

      <td>GMSL change is driven by warming or cooling of the ocean (and the associated expansion/contraction) and changes in the amount\nof ice and water stored on land. Paleo-evidence shows that GMSL has been about 70 m higher and 130 m lower than present within\nthe past 55 million years and was likely 5 to 10 m higher during the Last Interglacial (Box TS.2, Figure 1). Sea level observations show\nthat GMSL rose by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901&#8211;2018 at an average rate of 1.7 [1.3 to 2.2] mm yr&#8211;1. New analyses\nand paleo-evidence since AR5 show this rate is very likely faster than during any century over at least the last three millennia (high\nconfidence). Since AR5, there is strengthened evidence for an increase in the rate of GMSL rise since the mid-20th century, with an\naverage rate of 2.3 [1.6&#8211;3.1] mm yr&#8211;1 over the period 1971&#8211;2018 increasing to 3.7 [3.2&#8211;4.2] mm yr&#8211;1 for the period 2006&#8211;2018 (high\nconfidence). {2.3.3, 9.6.1, 9.6.2}</td>
