<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Due to the success of the 8-week CCHH ECHO series, the authors decided to launch
a weekly 60&#8197;min CCHH ECHO &#8220;Continuous Conversation Office Hours,&#8221; beginning in
August 18, 2021. Changes to the original format include shortening each session
to 60&#8197;min, allowing more time for questions and answers, and planning for
presentations on mental health, climate justice and environmental stewardship.
The authors are also planning to begin a similar program in India, in addition
to an 8 to 10 week &#8220;train the trainer&#8221; program, so that highly motivated health
professionals may deliver a climate change course at their own institution.</p>
