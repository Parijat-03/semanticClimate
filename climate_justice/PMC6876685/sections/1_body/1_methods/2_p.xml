<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study was conducted in an introductory biology course geared toward science majors at a large Midwestern university during two semesters in the 2017&#8211;2018 academic year. Most students in this course attended (in&#8208;person) a large lecture section led by a professor (Figure <xref rid="ece35736-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and a smaller discussion section led by a teaching assistant; a smaller subset of the students attended (also in&#8208;person) a smaller lecture and discussion led by a lecturer. The instructors of the large lecture section, and some of the course lectures and discussion section materials, differed between the two semesters, but the climate change module was largely consistent, including having the same learning objectives. The climate change course materials were based in part on materials developed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In particular, the instructors sought to highlight five points: (a) Climate change is happening now, (b) Climate change is largely caused by humans, (c) The best way to slow climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (d) Climate change is already altering species and ecosystems, and (e) Climate change affects human health. Climate change was the primary focus of one 80&#8208;min lecture (out of 24 lectures total) and one 80&#8208;min discussion section (out of 10 discussions total); climate change was also covered in additional lectures (e.g., discussing the spread of Lyme disease in the Midwest during a lecture on emerging infectious diseases).</p>
