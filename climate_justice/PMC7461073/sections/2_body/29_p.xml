For example, the Energy Charter Treaty, which covers the trade and transit of energy in much of the EU [European Union], currently allows for energy companies to sue governments for huge amounts of compensation if they change their environmental laws to bring them in line with climate goals. Companies are already threatening to sue governments under the Treaty for phasing out coal fired power. Countries need to work together to radically rehaul regional and international trade and investment agreements so that they don't prioritise the interests of the fossil fuel industry over climate justice and our collective survival.</p>
