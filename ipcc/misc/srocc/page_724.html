Funding for agriculture (rather than mitigation) is accessed through the smaller adaptation funds (Lobell et al. 2013). Focusing on synergies, between mitigation, adaptation, and increased productivity, such as through climate-smart agriculture (CSA) (Lipper et al. 2014b) (Section&#160;7.5.6), may leverage greater &#64257;nancial resources (Suckall et al. 2015; Locatelli et al. 2016).

Many small-scale projects are demonstrating that sustainable landscape management (Section&#160;7.6.3) is key to achieving LDN, and it is also more &#64257;nancially viable in the long term than the unsustainable alternative (T&#243;th et al. 2018; Kust et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="270.65" top="327.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 327.42; y1: 337.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="327.42" x1="270.65">7.4.7.2 Instruments to manage the &#64257;nancial impacts of&#160;climate and land change disruption</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="291.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 291.52; y1: 301.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="291.52" x1="307.57">Comprehensive risk management (Section&#160;7.4.3.1) designs a&#160;portfolio of instruments which are used across a&#160;continuum of preemptive, planning and assessment, and contingency measures in order to bolster resilience (Cummins and Weiss 2016) and address limitations of any one instrument (Surminski 2016; Surminski et&#160;al. 2016; Linnerooth-bayer et al. 2019). Instruments designed and applied in isolation have shown short-term results, rather than sustained intended impacts (Vincent et al. 2018).

Forecast-based &#64257;nance mechanisms incorporate these principles, using climate or other indicators to trigger funding and action prior to a&#160;shock (Wilkinson 2018). Forecast-based mechanisms can be linked with social protection systems by providing contingent scaled-up &#64257;nance quickly to vulnerable populations following disasters, enhancing scalability, timeliness, predictability and adequacy of social protection bene&#64257;ts (Wilkinson 2018; Costella et al. 2017b; World Food Programme 2018).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="543.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 543.57; y1: 553.07; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="543.57" x1="566.1">Measures in advance of risks set aside resources before negative impacts related to adverse weather, climatic stressors, and land changes occur.
