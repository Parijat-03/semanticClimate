In the USA, because of the long history of racially -driven marginalization policies and practices, renters are more likely to be minorities and low-income populations. These same factors have also led, in many areas, to limited, affordable rental housing stock being located in higher-risk areas. The plight of renters within the context of climate justice considerations is one that cannot be overlooked, especially considering the prevalence of renters in floodplains. As climate change creates more severe disasters and our population increases, the situation is likely to worsen.</p>
