For example, in July 2020, over 150 Fridays for Future activists proposed legislation to the European Union (EU) via the European Citizens&#8217; Initiative. The initiative urges the EU to adjust its nationally determined contributions goals under the Paris Agreement to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2035; implement an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism; legislate that free trade agreements cannot be signed with countries that do not have climate policies aligned with the 1.5&#176;C warming limit; and create educational materials for all EU members on climate change impacts.<sup><xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> According to the Fridays for Future movement, the European Citizens&#8217; Initiative now has over 89,000 signatories and has been enshrined in legislation in 15 EU member states.<sup><xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p>
