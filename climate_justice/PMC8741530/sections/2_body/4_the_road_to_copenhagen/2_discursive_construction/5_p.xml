The EU differentiated China from other &#8216;ordinary&#8217; developing countries and defined China as an &#8216;economically more advanced developing country&#8217; that should undertake more international responsibilities (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). Moreover, many G77 members, including Asian countries, and several major developing countries such as Mexico and Argentina also shared this perception and requested China and other major emitters to bear more international responsibilities (Kastner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>; Stalley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2013</xref>).</p>
