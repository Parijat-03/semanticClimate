<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In contrast to prior programme evaluations that often rushed into large-scale effectiveness studies, we will follow recent guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions and conduct a comprehensive feasibility study focusing on important uncertainties of the evaluation design [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pilot study will thus lay solid groundwork for a comprehensive effectiveness and process evaluation including the investigation of implementation, mechanisms linking the PCS to its intended outcomes and contextual factors moderating implementation and intervention effectiveness. The primary objectives of the pilot study are to investigate participant recruitment and retention, data collection and data quality. The uptake of the online and paper&#8211;pencil survey modes will guide the selection of survey modes for the full-scale evaluation, while considering the trade-off between providing students low-threshold opportunities to participate in the study and minimising the burden for schools associated with administering multiple survey modes. The assessment of missing data will uncover potential to improve structure and content of the student surveys. The investigation of basic psychometric properties of the primary and secondary endpoints such as scale distributions and floor or ceiling effects will identify items and scales with poor psychometric performance and will provide opportunities to improve items and scales prior to the large-scale effectiveness evaluation.</p>
