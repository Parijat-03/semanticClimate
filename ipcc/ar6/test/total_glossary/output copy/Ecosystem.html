<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">A functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment and the interactions within and between them.</p>
<p>The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems, and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment.</p>
