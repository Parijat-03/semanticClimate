      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits by reduced size, severity and frequency of wildfires, thereby preventing emissions and\npreserving carbon stocks (Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.16, Chapter 2, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2).\nAdaptation: Moderate benefits by reducing mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke exposure, fire management\nprovides adaptation benefits (Doerr and Sant&#237;n 2016; Johnston et al. 2012; Koplitz et al. 2016) (Table 6.24). Desertifi-\ncation: Large benefits since control of wildfires and long-term maintenance of tree stock density protects against soil\nerosion (Neary et al. 2009; Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.32). Land degradation: Large benefits by stabilising forest\necosystems (Neary et al. 2009; Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.40). Food security: Moderate benefits by maintain-\ning forest food product availability and preventing fire expansion to agricultural land (FAO 2015; Keenan et al. 2015;\nFAO et al. 2018; Pradhan et al. 2013; World Bank 2018a, b) (Table 6.48).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: The prevention of landslides and natural hazards benefits mitigation, but because of the limited impact\non GHG emissions and eventual preservation of topsoil carbon stores, the impact is estimated to be small globally\n(IPCC AR5 WG2, Chapter 14) (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Provides structural/physical adaptations to climate change\n(IPCC AR5 WG2, Chapter 14) (Table 6.24). Desertification: Due to the small global areas affected within global dry-\nlands, the benefits for desertification control are limited (Chapter 3 and Table 6.32). Land degradation: Since landslides\nand natural hazards are among the most severe degradation processes, prevention will have a large positive impact on\nland degradation (FAO and ITPS 2015) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.40). Food security: In countries where mountain slopes\nare cropped for food, such as in the Pacific Islands (Campbell 2015), the management and prevention of landslides\ncan deliver benefits for food security, though the global areas are limited (Table 6.48).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits since measures to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) can slow projected\nglobal mean warming (UNEP and WMO 2011), with early intervention providing 0.5&#176;C cooling by 2050 (UNEP and WMO\n2011) (Table 6.16). But moderate negative impacts are also possible since reduced reactive nitrogen deposition could\ndecrease terrestrial carbon uptake (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Moderate benefits since controlling particulate matter (PM2.5)\nand ozone improves human health (Anenberg et al. 2012) (Table 6.24). Desertification: Moderate benefits since salinisa-\ntion, pollution and acidification are stressors for desertification (Oldeman et al. 1991) (Table 6.32). Land degradation:\nModerate benefits since acid deposition is a significant driver of land degradation (Oldeman et al. 1991; Smith et al. 2015)\n(Table 6.40). Food security: Large benefits since ozone is harmful to crops, so measures to reduce air pollution would be\nexpected to increase crop production (FAO 2018b; FAO et al. 2018; Shindell et al. 2012; World Bank 2018a) (Table 6.48).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits since coastal wetland restoration and avoided coastal wetland impacts deliver moderate\ncarbon sinks by 2030 (Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Large benefits by providing a natural defence\nagainst coastal flooding and storm surges by dissipating wave energy, reducing erosion and by helping to stabilise shore\nsediments (Table 6.24). Desertification: There is likely negligible impact of coastal wetland restoration for prevention\nof desertification (Table 6.32). Land degradation: Limited benefits since large areas of global coastal wetlands are\ndegraded (Lotze et al. 2006; Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.40). Food security: Small benefits to small adverse impacts\nsince large areas of converted coastal wetlands are used for food production (e.g., mangroves converted for aquaculture),\nrestoration could displace food production and damage local food supply, though mangrove restoration can also restore\nlocal fisheries (Naylor et al. 2000) (Table 6.48).</td>

Adaptation: Likely to be benefits by regulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding\n(Munang et al. 2014) (Table 6.24), but the global potential has not been quantified. Desertification: No impact since\npeatlands occur in wet areas and deserts in dry areas. Land degradation: Moderate benefits since large areas of global\npeatlands are degraded (Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.40). Food security: Moderate adverse impacts since restoration of\nlarge areas of tropical peatlands and some northern peatlands that have been drained and cleared for food production,\ncould displace food production and damage local food supply (Table 6.48).</td>
