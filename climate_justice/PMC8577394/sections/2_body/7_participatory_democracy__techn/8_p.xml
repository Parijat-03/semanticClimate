Over the last decade, the city&#8217;s political elite has voiced strong support for including residents&#8217; input in planning for the relatively novel challenge of climate change. In the case of the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project specifically, the switch to a technocratic decision-making style also made the project more expensive, thus distributing significantly more resources into the neighborhood. In the first phase of the project, the entirety of the design for the $1.45 billion infrastructure project was self-consciously up for deliberation, and city officials explicitly gave any residents that came to public meetings the opportunity to directly design &#8220;community-driven&#8221; flood protection. But in the second phase, city officials sidestepped public input by building an argument that deferred to engineering concerns to render the public plan unfeasible.</p>
