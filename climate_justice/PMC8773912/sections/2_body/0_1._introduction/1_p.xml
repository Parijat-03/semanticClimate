<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) revealed that approximately one in nine children (11.8%) used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the previous 12 months [<xref rid="B1-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some children are significantly more likely to use CAM (also referred to as integrative medicine), including children with mental health issues [<xref rid="B2-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], pain conditions [<xref rid="B3-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], respiratory concerns [<xref rid="B4-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cancer [<xref rid="B5-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and neurological concerns [<xref rid="B6-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Families often do not consult with a healthcare provider about the use of integrative medicine, and may not disclose its use to their medical doctor [<xref rid="B4-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the 2012 NHIS survey, only 18.4% of CAM usage had been recommended by a medical doctor [<xref rid="B2-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is critical that parents and guardians are guided by healthcare providers thoroughly trained in integrative approaches to pediatric care. Additionally, the establishment of healthy habits and the promotion of optimal lifestyle are core components of pediatric practice, influencing individual and community health through the lifespan.</p>
