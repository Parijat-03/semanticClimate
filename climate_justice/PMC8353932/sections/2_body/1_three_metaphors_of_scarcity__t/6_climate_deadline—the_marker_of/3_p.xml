This Carbon Clock of the MCC shows how much time is left before the carbon budgets for the 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C targets are exhausted, counting down each second until the due date.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> Crucially, the calculated time on the clock is derived from the IPCC SR15&#8217;s estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Unlike the figurative nature of the <italic>Bulletin&#8217;s</italic> Doomsday Clock, the MCC&#8217;s Carbon Clock conveys a more literal sense of a deadline that is based not on the subjective judgement of experts but on a precise measurement estimated by the modelling. However, the intention behind setting up this Carbon Clock is similar to the Doomsday Clock&#8212;to warn the public how little time is left to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Both clocks thus serve the same <italic>metaphorical</italic> function of evoking a sense of urgency through the imagery of a ticking clock.</p>
