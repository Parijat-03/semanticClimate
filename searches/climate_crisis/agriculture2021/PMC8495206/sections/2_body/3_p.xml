<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0004">Although we mainly relate climate urgency to extreme weather events, the direct impact on our health is extensive. With major episodes of wildfires and drought, respiratory diseases are prone to be abundant due to toxic air and the exposure of pollutants. The produced smoke is full of particulate matter from the wildfire, which can be associated with respiratory morbidity, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and pneumonia. As wildfires occur more frequently, the incidence of respiratory diseases will be higher every year and those who live close to the area will be most affected. Additionally, with the rise of water levels and an increase in global temperatures, flooding will be increasingly frequent, especially in coastal areas. The occurrence of waterborne infectious diseases, stress, malnutrition, and lack of access to health care will become more frequent, hitting especially those who are most vulnerable, such as children and older people. Although concerning, infections are not the only issue. Fires and floods lead not only to the loss of homes, belongings, and jobs of many, but also of many family and friends. The impact on mental health is considerable, leading to an increase in depression and anxiety, for example. In the areas where houses were destroyed, impoverishment will be prone to build up, thus escalating homelessness and violence. As these climate events occur, people will become more vulnerable and inequalities will be even more evident. Mortality rates will increase yearly if no serious actions are taken.</p>
