<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par14">Previous efforts to embed CCE within education systems have been centered around teacher education (Vega-Marcote and Varela-Losada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>; Hopkins and McKeown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>; Varga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2007</xref>) or a school-based implementation of a whole school approach (UNESCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). However, neither teachers nor schools are the only constituents of education. Multiple key stakeholders in education such as educational policy makers, researchers, teacher certification boards, teacher education institution executives, administrative staff, and students must all work together in the reorientation towards sustainability. Ferreira et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>) call this a &#8220;Whole-of System Model,&#8221; in which all elements of the system are engaged in the process of embedding a new curriculum, new policy, or whatever is (collectively) determined to be most needed within the particular contexts.</p>
