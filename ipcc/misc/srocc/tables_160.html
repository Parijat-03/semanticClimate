      <td>Fires have been a natural part of Earth&#8217;s geological past and its biological evolution since at least the late Silurian, about\n400 million years ago (Scott 2000). Presently, roughly 3% of the Earth&#8217;s land surface burns annually which affects both energy\nand matter exchanges between the land and atmosphere (Stanne et al. 2009). Climate is a major determinant of fire regimes\nthrough its control of fire weather, as well as through its interaction with vegetation productivity (fuel availability) and structure (fuel\ndistribution and flammability) (Archibald et al. 2013) at the global (Krawchuk and Moritz 2011), regional (Pausas and Paula 2012)\nand local (Mondal and Sukumar 2016) landscape scales. Presently, humans are the main cause of fire ignition with lightning playing a\nlesser role globally (Bowman et al. 2017; Harris et al. 2016), although the latter factor has been predominantly responsible for large fires\nin regions such as the North American boreal forests (Veraverbeke et al. 2017). Humans also influence fires by actively extinguishing\nthem, reducing spread and managing fuels.</td>

      <td>since then (Bowman et al. 2011). There was less biomass burning during the 20th century than at any time during the past two millennia\nas inferred from charcoal sedimentary records (Doerr and Sant&#237;n 2016), though there has been an increase in the most recent decades\n(Marlon et al. 2016). Trends in land area burnt have varied regionally (Giglio et al. 2013). Northern hemisphere Africa has experienced a fire\ndecrease of 1.7 Mha yr&#8211;1 (&#8211;1.4% yr&#8211;1) since 2000, while southern hemisphere Africa saw an increase of 2.3 Mha yr&#8211;1 (+1.8% yr&#8211;1) during\nthe same period. Southeast Asia witnessed a small increase of 0.2 Mha yr&#8211;1 (+2.5% yr&#8211;1) since 1997, while Australia experienced a sharp\ndecrease of about 5.5 Mha yr&#8211;1 (&#8211;10.7% yr&#8211;1) during 2001&#8211;2011, followed by an upsurge in 2011 that exceeded the annual area burned\nin the previous 14 years. A recent analysis using the Global Fire Emissions Database v.4 (GFED4s) that includes small fires concluded that\nthe net reduction in land area burnt globally during 1998&#8211;2015 was &#8211;24.3 &#177; 8.8% (&#8211;1.35 &#177; 0.49% yr&#8211;1) (Andela et al. 2017). However,\nfrom the point of fire emissions it is important to consider the land cover types which have experienced changes in area burned; in\nthis instance, most of the declines have come from grasslands, savannas and other non-forest land cover types (Andela et al. 2017).\nSignificant increases in forest area burned (with higher fuel consumption per unit area) have been recorded in western and boreal</td>
