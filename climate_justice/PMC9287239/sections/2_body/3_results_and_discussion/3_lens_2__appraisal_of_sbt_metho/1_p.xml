Extant literature has focused primarily on the fairness and appropriateness of existing methods for setting SBTs and the extent to which they align corporate action with the Paris temperature goal. Even though SBTi recognizes two methods for setting SBTs, there is no academic consensus as to which criteria a method must meet, whether companies should have flexibility in selecting which method to use, and whether it is possible or desirable for current methods to be consistent with national commitments. There is concerning evidence that SBTi methods and emission accounting standards may not lead to the needed emission reductions, particularly related to the potential for misalignment between aggregate SBTs and global allowable emissions, the use of renewable energy certificates, and unresolved scope 3 accounting issues. More transparency from SBTi and companies with SBTs is needed to assess alignment of SBTs with the Paris temperature goal and increase the chance that SBTs will have the intended impact on global emissions.</p>
