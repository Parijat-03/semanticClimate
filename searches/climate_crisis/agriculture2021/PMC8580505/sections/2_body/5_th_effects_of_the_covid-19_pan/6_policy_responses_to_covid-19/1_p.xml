Policy actions, such as subsidising extractive, agricultural and development industries, can drive fast economic growth but can also exacerbate land-use changes, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and unsustainable agricultural intensification, all of which can drive and contribute to future emerging diseases. For example, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has surged during the current administration.<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> As of March, 2021, 57 pieces of legislation that weaken existing environmental policies have been signed.<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr"><sup>86</sup></xref> The government's pro-development approach during the COVID-19 pandemic has opened native forests to extractive industries, such as agriculture and cattle ranching, with proposals promoting land grabs<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr"><sup>87</sup></xref> and mining in Indigenous reserves<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> also in the pipeline. Reductions to the Ministry of Environment budget will further affect Brazil's oversight bodies that monitor illegal deforestation, pollution levels, pesticide contamination, illegal mining, and illegal wildlife trafficking.<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr"><sup>90</sup></xref> The effects on these activities and their links to wildfires, biodiversity loss, and increased greenhouse gas emissions<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref> can feed back into increased risk of zoonotic spillover events in Brazil and internationally.</p>
