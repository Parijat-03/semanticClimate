Nurses in clinical practice have great potential to enact climate protective actions; providing resources for them should be a top priority for the profession. Practicing nurses understand the organizational lay of the land; they often have new ideas for projects and have coped with organizational barriers. To be successful they will need basic training in environmental health problems, a modest project budget, and ongoing professional mentoring.</p>
