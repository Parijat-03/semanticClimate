novel qualitative and quantitative methods that capture and assess the accuracy
in public understanding of statistical and scientific visualizations in the news
to avoid possible misinterpretations of facts or forecasts on the public level

principles</italic> subtheme show examples of commenter-led initiatives to
educate others about basic modeling principles such as model assumptions, model
interpretation, and model performance evaluation, we think that this inclination
could be more explicitly shaped and encouraged through journalistic initiatives
similar to the New York Times &#8220;What is Going on in this Graph?&#8221;<sup><xref rid="fn6-14614448221135632" ref-type="fn">6</xref></sup> that grants
students and readers the online space to develop their data-literacy skills
through discussing and interpreting visualizations as a group.</p>
