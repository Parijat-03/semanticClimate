(2012) highlight the post-recovery and reconstruction period as an opportunity to build new resilience and adaptive capacities. Ziegler et al. (2014) exemplify consequences when such process is rushed or poorly supported by appropriate long-term planning, as illustrated following the 2013 Kedarnath glacier &#64258;ood disaster, where guest houses and even schools were being rebuilt in the same exposed locations, driven by short-term perspectives. As changes in the mountain cryosphere, together with socioeconomic, cultural and political developments are producing conditions beyond historical precedent, related responses are suggested to include forward-thinking planning and anticipation of emerging risks and opportunities (Haeberli et al., 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="579.54"><span x0="59.53" y0="579.54" x1="307.57" style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Researchers, policymakers, international donors and local communities do not always agree on the timing of disaster risk reduction projects and programs, impeding full coordination (Huggel et al., 2015b; Allen et al., 2018).

Since the 1940s, glacier hazards have killed thousands (Carey, 2005) and&#160;remain threatening. Glacier wastage has also reduced river runoff in most of its basins in recent decades, particularly in the&#160;dry season (Baraer et al., 2012; Vuille et al., 2018). Residents living adjacent to the Cordillera Blanca have long recognised this glacier shrinkage, including rural populations living near glaciers and urban residents worried about glacier lake &#64258;oods and glacier landslides (Jurt et al., 2015; Walter, 2017). Glacier hazards and the glacier runoff variability increase exposure and uncertainty while&#160;diminishing adaptive capacity (Rasmussen, 2016).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.91" top="363.53"><span x0="73.7" y0="363.53" x1="551.91" style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.8; y0: 363.53; y1: 373.03; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Cordillera Blanca residents&#8217; risk of glacier-related disasters is ampli&#64257;ed by intersecting physical and societal factors. Cryosphere hazards include expanding or newly forming glacial lakes, slope instability, and other consequences of rising temperatures, and precipitation changes (Emmer et al., 2016; Colonia et al., 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017). Human vulnerability to these hazards is conditioned by factors such as poverty, limited political in&#64258;uence and resources, minimal access to education and healthcare, and&#160;weak government institutions (Hegglin and Huggel, 2008; Carey et al., 2012; Lynch, 2012; Carey et al., 2014; Heikkinen, 2017). Early warning systems have been, or are being, installed at glacial lakes Laguna 513 and Palcacocha to protect populations (Mu&#241;oz&#160;et al., 2016). Laguna 513 was lowered by 20 m for outburst prevention in the early 1990s but nonetheless caused a&#160;destructive &#64258;ood in 2010, though much smaller and less destructive than a &#64258;ood that would have been expected without previous lake mitigation works (Carey et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2014). An early warning system was subsequently installed, but&#160;some local residents destroyed it in 2017 due to political, social and cultural con&#64258;icts (Fraser, 2017). The nearby Lake Palcacocha&#160;also threatens populations (Wegner, 2014; Somos-Valenzuela et al., 2016). The usefulness for ground-level education&#160;and&#160;communication&#160;regarding advanced early warning systems has been demonstrated in Peru (Mu&#241;oz et al., 2016). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.9" top="207.55"><span x0="73.7" y0="207.55" x1="551.9" style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.8; y0: 207.55; y1: 217.05; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Vulnerability to hydrologic variability and declining glacier runoff is also shaped by intertwining human and biophysical drivers playing out in dynamic hydro-social systems (Bury et al., 2013; Rasmussen 2016; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Carey et al., 2017). Water security is in&#64258;uenced by both water availability (supply from glaciers) as well as by water distribution, which is affected by factors such as water laws and policies, global demand for agricultural products grown in the lower Santa River basin, energy demands and&#160;hydroelectricity production, potable water usage, and livelihood transformations over time (Carey et al., 2014; Vuille et al., 2018). In some cases, the formation of new glacial lakes can create opportunities as well as hazards, such as new tourist attractions&#160;and reservoirs of water, thereby showing how socioeconomic and geophysical forces intersect in complex ways&#160;(Colonia&#160;et al., 2017).</span></div></body></html>
