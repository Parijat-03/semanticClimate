<p>The &#8216;second story&#8217; elicited significant stories of resistance or sustenance as
they responded to their challenges expressed in the &#8216;first story&#8217;. Many lessons
were learned about how people can cope through times of struggle and themes included the values
that students drew from: Hope, Optimism/Positivity, Reciprocity, Gratefulness, Patience,
Adaptability and Acceptance. Students were also drawing on critical thinking, especially as so
much misinformation about COVID-19 was on social media and which tended to make them feel
overwhelmed. They reported that they committed to their own self-care and chose to focus on
activities to help sustain their physical, emotional and mental health. They also found a well
of support through their cultural or faith communities and drew on faith traditions and other
spiritual practices to help get them through this difficult time. Importantly, staying
connected to close friends and extended family became vital, especially for international
students who were unable to return home with national borders closed. Most significantly, these
are stories of connection, cooperation, mutuality and reciprocity despite the COVID-19
circumstances. Employing the biographical double-listening narrative process highlighted how
powerful story telling can be when people feel respected and experts in their own lives. It
proved its usefulness to elicit stories of resilience during a time of significant challenge,
as well as its applicability as a qualitative research tool.</p>
