How (if at all) are they reframing themselves? What kinds of visitor experiences are being created to address changing roles and goals? And to what end? In this article, we focus specifically on the changing landscape and the development of what we identify as <italic>fourth-generation science museums</italic> (Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>). We subsequently describe six key drivers that characterize and scaffold this generation, and illustrate how institutional practices from around the world reflect these emerging ideas.</p>
