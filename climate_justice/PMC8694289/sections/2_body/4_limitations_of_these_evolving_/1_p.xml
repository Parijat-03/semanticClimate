However, potential gaps remain. In 2010, Conor Gearty noted that the focus on the rights of the human species to the exclusion of other living organisms&#8212;animals, plants, and, indeed, the planet&#8212;has been interpreted by some observers to imply that &#8220;human rights&#8221; may actually <italic toggle="yes">hinder</italic> environmental protection. Nonetheless, Gearty acknowledges the value of the civil and political rights to the environmental movement, noting that &#8220;the assertion of civil and political rights gives activists a universal language&#8212;understandable even to those who do not share their substantive concerns&#8212;with which to fight back against a state intent on silencing them.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p>
