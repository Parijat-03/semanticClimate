Qualitative data from those reporting higher levels of CCA and mental health symptoms demonstrated the way in which CCA may manifest among emerging adults who are also experiencing clinical symptoms, namely in diffuse and acute worries, feelings of helplessness, and an overall sense of hopelessness and doom. Moreover, responses demonstrated how climate change anxiety can pose a barrier to engaging with goals typically salient in emerging adulthood such as education, career, and family-related goals, which may contribute to a loss of meaning or purpose. This may be of particular concern in the context of an emerging adult population that is already more vulnerable to mental health distress.</p>
