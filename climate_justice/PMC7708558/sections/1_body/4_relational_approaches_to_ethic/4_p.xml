<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par38">Critical scholars contend that deep ecology has an apolitical view of systems change, so they claim it is important to integrate deep ecology with social ecology (Slocombe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2002</xref>). Gary Snyder is one example of a thinker who has integrated both deep and social ecology in his activism and writings (Messersmith-Glavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>). As developed by Bookchin (Biehl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>), social ecology adds a critical perspective on class-based struggles of marginalized people by considering how ecology is informed by social hierarchy and domination. Radical social ecology investigates the material, social, and spiritual conditions of an ecological society by pursuing the elimination of human&#8217;s domination of nature via the elimination of human&#8217;s domination of humans. It connects ecological issues to a broad array of interconnected social issues (Bookchin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1980</xref>).</p>
