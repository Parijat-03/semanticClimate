Lockdown measures during 2020 included the temporary closures of restaurants and school/work canteens in many countries and in some cases, resulting in an increase in the consumption of unhealthy, highly processed food. For example, food purchasing trends in the USA show clear increases in the consumption of ultra-processed, energy-dense comfort foods such as potato chips, chocolate, and ice cream (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Bhutani and Cooper, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, home confinement and gym closures are impacting structured exercise and physical activity. A study in northern Italy showed that individuals with obesity had already gained significant weight one month into the lockdown (<xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrini et al., 2020</xref>). Adolescents from a range of countries, for example in Latin America, reported reduced physical activity and shifts to the consumption of ultra-processed foods during the pandemic (<xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">Ru&#237;z-Roso et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these changes are longer lasting after all COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and what the impacts will be on chronic disease risks remains to be seen.</p>
