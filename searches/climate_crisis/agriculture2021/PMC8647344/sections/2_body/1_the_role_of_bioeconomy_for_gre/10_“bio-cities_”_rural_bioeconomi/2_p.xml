<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0395">Cities have a critical role in developing and implementing the circular bioeconomy due to the large population, high intensity of economic activities, and increased consumption of goods. Urban livelihoods are affected by different choices concerning infrastructures, education, commerce, and healthy mobility. The pandemic has dramatically affected mobility in urban settlements, and recovery plans could restructure urban environments through smart mobility instead of unsustainable, horizontal lockdown (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Acuto et al., 2020</xref>). Lockdown vehicle restrictions could be relevant interventions in the post-pandemic era leading to cleaner air and healthier cities (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Urban living has entered a new generation where cars' mobility and subsequent carbon emissions could be minimized. For instance, at the beginning of 2021, Saudi Arabia announced &#8220;The Line,&#8221; a revolutionary city of 170&#160;km in length to be built around nature with zero cars, zero streets, and zero carbon emissions (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Arab News, 2021</xref>). However, current and modern cities' active mobility networks and public transportation infrastructures must be expanded to ensure all citizens' affordability and accessibility (including those living in suburban neighborhoods) (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Daniels et al., 2020</xref>). Rebound effects in urban/peri-urban and non-urban mobility can also be reasonably expected due to consumers' reduced confidence in public transportations' health and safety. This trend could change consumers' behavior even well beyond the pandemic and should be very carefully monitored.</p>
