All of the activists I interviewed are over 50, and most were over 65, and they are primarily white, though several Puerto Rican activists have been high-profile critics of the new plan, and some were even tenants in public housing. People with these characteristics constituted almost the entirety of the vocal voices against the plan. Most activists I spoke to had come to the neighborhood as adults in the 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s, and have been activists for decades. Greg, for example, a visible activist and organizer of some of the best-attended protests, moved to the East Village in the 1970&#8217;s and immediately became involved in the neighborhood&#8217;s squatter movement Now he&#160;runs a community center with a focus on &#8220;social and environmental justice.&#8221; Similarly, many other activists I spoke with worked in affordable housing nonprofits for the last two or three decades, and through the 2000&#8217;s participated in organized efforts against what they identified as the rapid gentrification of the neighborhood. People who spoke in meetings supporting the plan were invariably of Puerto Rican descent or black, lived in public housing, and often held leadership positions in their housing developments.</p>
