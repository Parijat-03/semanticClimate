<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In a comparative study of Philippines and Timor-Leste, five important features of climate-smart agricultural practices were observed by Chandra and McNamara [<xref rid="B88-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]; strategies at country-specific institutional levels; delegated financial procedures; the state of the market; technology; and knowledge. In the two countries, CSA was used to resolve climate vulnerability challenges more than it was associated with emission reduction goals [<xref rid="B88-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Overall, the researchers observed that advancing the course of CSA in these countries might involve multi-stakeholder approaches that cuts across different levels of participation, both within and outside the farm, rather than mere technical CSA developmental inputs [<xref rid="B88-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. From the above arguments for and against CSA, it is clear that while there are still fundamental challenges revolving round the CSA concept, the terms might likely continue to be utilized for agricultural problem solving, until it attains uniformity and intersection of ideologies, amongst researchers and policy makers. </p>
