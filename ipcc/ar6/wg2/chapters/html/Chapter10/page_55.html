As seen in the case of Japan, most of the countries in Asia face the challenge of contractual allocation of risks associated with natural hazards and climate change between the public and private sectors and its long-term management in the face of uncertainty. Risk sharing, therefore, could be addressed by clear definition and allocation (World Bank, 2017). Given that in Asia, especially Singapore, China, Japan and Republic of Korea, where the water sector is a target of industrial and technology policy, PPPs could prove to be mutually beneficial. As a middle ground, key findings of a study on Indonesia (Yoseph-Paulus and Hindmarsh, 2016) underline the importance of building, sustaining and augmenting local capacity by addressing inadequacies with regard to resource endowment and capacity building, public awareness about climate change, government&#8211;community partnerships, vulnerability assessment and providing inclusive decision-making spaces to Indigenous knowledge systems and communities.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.72" top="498.63"><span x0="54.14" y0="498.63" x1="307.72" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 56.44; y0: 498.63; y1: 508.13; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the agriculture sector, farmers in Asia are adapting to climate change at the grassroots level (Tripathi and Mishra, 2017). A recent, comprehensive and systematic review (Shaffril et&#160;al., 2018) shows how farmers in diverse sub-regions of Asia have adopted diverse adaptation strategies through management of crops, irrigation and water, farms, finances, physical infrastructure and social activities. Much more qualitative research on farmers&#8217; perceptions and decision-making processes about adaptation practices is needed in order to capture their location-specific priorities and get a diverse understanding of the risks and threats. A study of Vietnamese smallholder farmers&#8217; perceptions of their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change (Phuong et&#160;al., 2018a) found considerable differences between farmers in crop production and livestock production in terms of their motives behind adopting particular planned adaptation options.</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.68" top="318.65"><span x0="54.14" y0="318.65" x1="307.68" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 318.65; y1: 328.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A study on farmers&#8217; awareness of, and adaptation to, climate change in the dry zones of Myanmar, critically dependent on agriculture, indicates how those at the front line of the adverse effects of climate change are steadily abandoning the common sesame/groundnut cropping pattern, and trying to adapt to risks and uncertainties with the aid of conventional agricultural practices such as rainwater collection, water-harvesting techniques and even traditional weather forecasting techniques for weather prediction. Similarly, a case study of the Gandak basin in Nepal showed that incorporation of local knowledge into agricultural practices and weather warning systems works best when coupled with multiple sources of information based on a method of triangulation. This also intersects with gender outcomes, where women frequently receive information from the men of their households rather than directly from state institutional sources (Acharya and Prakash, 2019). Climate-change adaptive governance is facilitated by improved cross-scalar and cross-sectoral cooperation, exchange of information and experiences, and best practices (Smith et&#160;al., 2014; Watts et&#160;al., 2015; Gamble et&#160;al., 2016; Gilfillan et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="307.73" top="90.68"><span x0="54.14" y0="90.68" x1="307.73" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 59.59; y0: 90.68; y1: 100.18; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">An integrated approach informed by science, which examines multiple stressors along with Indigenous knowledge, appears to be of immense value (Elum et&#160;al., 2017).

Correspondingly, this category achieved higher levels of income and food security. The climate-development nexus suggests that CCA practices at the farm level can have significant development outcomes, besides reducing risk posed by changing weather patterns. Central to the CCA process is the growing recognition of the role that institutions play in both the hierarchical setting and across different scales to influence implementation of CCA in diverse areas of governance across social and political domains. Cuevas (2018) highlights the usefulness of mainstreaming CCA into local land-use planning in Albay, the Philippines, by involving networks of interacting institutions and institutional arrangements for overcoming obstacles that are potentially counterproductive and conflictual.</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.74" top="534.71"><span x0="318.18" y0="534.71" x1="571.74" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.64; y0: 534.71; y1: 544.21; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As noted by AR5 (IPCC, 2014a), research on issues related to both climate-change impacts on livestock production&#8211;demand for which is expected to double by 2050 in a world of 10&#160;billion people&#8211;and policy choices with regard to adaptation, especially at the local scale, is still limited but progressing (Rojas-Downing et&#160;al., 2017). The promise of diversification of livestock animals (within species), crop diversification and transition to mixed crop&#8211;livestock systems needs to be further explored. A study of livestock farmers in Pakistan showed that risk-coping mechanisms, such as purchasing livestock insurance and increasing land areas for fodder, are far more rewarding policy options in comparison with selling livestock and migrating to another place. Relatedly, the association of migration with adaptation measures is context specific and involves a number of factors pertaining to the socioeconomic circumstances of vulnerable agricultural groups in countries like India and Bangladesh (Ojha et&#160;al., 2014). In the 2010 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&#8217;s Cancun Adaptation Framework, migration was recognised as a form of adaptation that should be included in a country&#8217;s long-term adaptation planning where appropriate (Paragraph 14 f).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.77" top="294.74"><span x0="318.18" y0="294.74" x1="571.77" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.23; y0: 294.74; y1: 304.24; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Furthermore, agricultural climate-adaptation policy targeting livestock farmers in rural areas is </span><span style="x0: 403.64; x1: 407.68; y0: 282.74; y1: 292.24; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="403.64" y0="282.74" x1="440.63">very likely </span><span x0="440.7" y0="282.74" x1="571.91" style="x0: 440.7; x1: 443.51; y0: 282.74; y1: 292.24; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to benefit from better education and awareness as well as increased access to extension services among livestock farmers on climate risk-coping choices and strategies (Rahut and Ali, 2018). In Myanmar, the lack of adequate agricultural extension strategies has had a negative impact on adaptation outcomes in what is labelled the &#8216;central dry zone&#8217;. Farmers&#8217; perceptions of climate change contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the context where they identify deforestation and related activities as the main culprits. Their adaptive methods include agricultural land preparation and crop rotation practices in addition to rainwater-harvesting techniques (Swe et&#160;al., 2015). A study of vulnerable areas in Bangladesh (Alam et&#160;al., 2017) has shown that with policy support, livestock rearing can prove to be a viable substitute for crop production in areas prone to riverbank erosion. Carefully developed partnerships between government organisations and NGOs can come to the rescue of poor farmers and their precarious households by providing information about best practices for local adaptation strategies, including credit options with various institutions and creating an enabling environment for the promotion of agro-based industries. A study in community forestry in the Indian Himalayan region (Gupta and Koontz, 2019) has shown how the synergies and successful </span></div></body></html>
