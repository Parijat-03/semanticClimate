<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par19">A total of 25 publications were identified as relevant regarding relational approaches to ontology. They come mainly from the fields of philosophy, indigenous and religious studies, cultural studies, and political science. In this context, relevant discourses describing relational ontologies relate to speculative realism, process philosophy, new materialism, indigenous wisdom, and religious wisdom (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All relational ontologies posit that &#8220;the relations between entities are more fundamental than the entities themselves&#8221; (Wildman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2006</xref>, p. 1). No entity preexists the relations that constitute it.</p>
