New information and communication technologies (such as augmented reality) constitute the main interface between the exhibition and the visitor interaction. In this third<italic>-</italic>generation science museum, visitors tend to engage with exhibits by a combination of manipulating, reading, hearing, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays that respond to the visitor&#8217;s action and invite further response, as well as through hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor (Rennie &amp; McClafferty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1996</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Explora, Il Museo dei Bambini di Roma, Italy.
