While mitigation captured much of the attention and policy development in the early years of the UNFCCC, more recently as the effects of climate change become increasingly apparent, much greater attention and financing has been given to adaptation. At the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015, 195 countries adopted a global climate agreement due to enter into force in 2020 known as the Paris Agreement. In this agreement adaptation and its financing were given equal weight with mitigation and parties to the Paris Agreement committed to &#8216;making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development&#8217; (Article&#160;2.1c)(Whitley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>).</p>
