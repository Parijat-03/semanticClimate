Economists often assume that solving global warming is simply a matter of designing the right incentive structure and getting countries to sign on. But this misses a crucial point: norms matter&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2012a</xref>: 76). Some years earlier, in fact, at the time of the Kyoto talks in 1997, Sandel wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times, in which he raised three objections to emission trading schemes: &#8220;First, it creates loopholes that could enable wealthy countries to evade their obligations.... Second, turning pollution into a commodity to be bought and sold removes the moral stigma that is properly associated with it. If a company or a country is fined for spewing excessive pollutants into the air, the community conveys its judgement that the polluter has done something wrong. A fee, on the other hand, makes pollution just another cost of doing business, like wages, benefits and rent. The distinction between a fine and a fee for despoiling the environment is not one we should give up too easily.... A third objection to emission trading among countries is that it may undermine the sense of shared responsibility that increased global cooperation requires&#8221; (Sandel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1997</xref>: unpaginated).</p>
