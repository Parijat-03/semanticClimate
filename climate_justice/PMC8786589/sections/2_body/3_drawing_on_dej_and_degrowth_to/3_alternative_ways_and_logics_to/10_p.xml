This is necessary for starting to imagine a decolonial turn in the EU development approach and policies. This also concerns and requires a shift from policies that rely on technoscientific and market-based solutions and which go beyond the rhetoric of participation and selling &#8216;good governance&#8217; packages to &#8216;developing countries&#8217;. Taking a decolonial turn means (1) embracing and acting upon climate and epistemic justice, (2) embracing plurality of knowledge and epistemologies, and (3) recognising local autonomy of indigenous people, their cultural and political self-determination and self-governing authority, their territorial rights and practices of living with and within the web of life (Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>; Temper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>).<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(iv)</label><p id="Par51">Beyond global competitiveness and harmful competition, towards partnerships based on the principles of local autonomy, solidarity, mutual respect, reconciliation and redistribution of power and wealth</p></list-item></list></p>
