To scale up safety nets, which prioritize support for basic human needs, in particular food security and good nutrition, appropriate mechanisms and financing instruments need to be put in place. In this context governments may wish to consider how targeted fiscal reform and redistribution mechanisms might play an effective role in strengthening social resilience and equity within and across countries. Because of the lack of fiscal space and capacity, particularly in the least-developed countries, which are dependent on income from commodity and food imports and are hence hard hit by global economic crisis, international solidarity also needs to be strengthened to avoid a widening of the human development gap. While developed countries need to move rapidly to meet the minimum target of 0.7% of the GDP for official development assistance and to upscale associated support for food system transformation (see <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">von Braun et al., 2020</xref>), other complementary instruments should be explored to help developing countries manage risks embedded in their food systems and provide them with the fiscal space to increase access to essential social services.</p>
