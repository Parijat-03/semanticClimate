The primary concern of IOUs is to maximize shareholder profits, but because of the manner in which they are regulated, state-level climate and renewable electricity laws do not necessarily contradict this goal (Basseches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). In fact, Basseches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>) finds IOUs have been instrumental actors in <italic>supporting</italic> ambitious RPS policies in states such as California, Massachusetts, and Oregon. However, other utilities have historically obstructed or slowed climate policy progress, often mobilizing quietly to achieve these objectives. Whether they serve as proponents or obstructionists depends on their fuel mix, the individual state-level policy regime and the particular policy at hand; for example, utilities tend to uniformly oppose solar net metering policies because they threaten their monopoly control of the electric grid (Stokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2020</xref>). As Romankiewicz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>) find, the largest utilities set renewable portfolio goals but then fail to make the investment decisions necessary to achieve them. They also find that the preexisting portfolios of utilities (prior to the adoption of climate policy) is typically the strongest predictor of future investment decisions.</p>
