<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par41">In making the claim that women are closer to nature, however, some (but by no means most) ecofeminists have problematically upheld gendered concepts of nature that fail to overcome the dualistic thinking underlying the logic of domination (Gaard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>). Ecofeminism has since become more critical, intersectional, materialist, and posthumanist (Alaimo and Hekman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Gaard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). Prominent recent works include Alaimo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>), Braidotti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>), Zylinska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2014</xref>), Haraway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>), Keller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>) and Puis de la Bellacasa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2017</xref>). Posthuman feminists reject essentialist concepts of gender, and are much more technomaterialist, viewing human&#8211;nonhuman relations as materially informed by socio-technical systems. Posthumanism does not relegate its interest to animal (zoologic) encounters but explores relations of all kinds&#8212;both between biological beings (such as symbionts or holobionts) and cyborgs (or flesh machines).</p>
