The regional reanalyses also incorporate uncertainties due to deficiencies of the models, data assimilation schemes and observations. To estimate uncertainties, some regional reanalyses apply data assimilation using ensemble forecasts (Bach et&#160;al., 2016). Another approach compares multiple regional reanalyses produced with different systems covering the same domain, which represents the uncertainties better than single reanalysis systems with ensemble data assimilation schemes (Kaiser-Weiss et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.81" top="594.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="594.6" x1="298.81" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The regional reanalyses represent the frequencies of extremes and the distributions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and surface wind better than global reanalyses (</span><span style="x0: 176.54; x1: 181.12; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="176.54" y0="570.6" x1="232.78">high confidence</span><span x0="232.78" y0="570.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 232.78; x1: 235.42; y0: 570.6; y1: 580.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). This is due to the use of high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs), as indicated by different regional climate modelling studies (Mesinger et&#160;al., 2006; Bollmeyer et&#160;al., 2015; Bromwich et&#160;al., 2016, 2018;&#160;Dahlgren et&#160;al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Fukui et&#160;al., 2018; Su et&#160;al., 2019). Regional reanalyses, however, retain uncertainties due to deficiencies in the physical parametrization used in RCMs and by the use of relatively simple data assimilation algorithms (Bromwich et&#160;al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Su et&#160;al., 2019). Regional reanalyses can provide estimates that are more consistent with observations than dynamical downscaling approaches, due to the assimilation of additional local observations (</span><span style="x0: 171.43; x1: 176.01; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="171.43" y0="438.6" x1="229.19">high confidence</span><span x0="229.19" y0="438.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 229.19; x1: 231.83; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">) (Bollmeyer et&#160;al., 2015; Fukui et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="227.38" top="390.48"><span style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.94; y0: 390.48; y1: 400.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="50.74" y0="390.48" x1="227.38">10.2.2 Challenges for Regional Climate Change&#160;Assessment</span></div><div left="50.74" right="147.84" top="354.48"><span x0="50.74" y0="354.48" x1="147.84" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.54; y0: 354.48; y1: 364.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.1 Quality Control</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="330.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="330.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The usefulness of any observational dataset is conditioned by the availability and outcome of a&#160;quality control (QC) process. The objective of the QC is to verify that data are representative of the measured variable and to what degree the value could be contaminated by unrelated or conflicting factors (WMO, 2017a). Data quality assessment is key for ensuring that the data are credible and to establish trusted relationships between the data provider and the users (Nightingale et&#160;al., 2019). QC is performed for all relevant global climate datasets (e.g.,&#160;Menne et&#160;al., 2018). For instance, QC informs users that old reanalysis datasets can be inconsistent in the long term because they assimilated inhomogeneous observations over the reanalyses period (Kobayashi et&#160;al., 2015). As a&#160;consequence, the evaluation against independent observations suggests that reanalyses should not be automatically regarded as climate-quality products for monitoring long-term trends at the regional level (Manzanas et&#160;al., 2014; Torralba et&#160;al., 2017). QC needs to be systematically carried out by the institutions responsible for handling the data (e.g.,&#160;Cao&#160;et&#160;al., 2016b).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="102.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="102.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The QC procedure depends strongly on the specific nature of the dataset.

An important piece of information provided is the representativeness error (Section&#160;10.2.1.1; Gervais et&#160;al., 2014). When problems in the data representativeness are identified, observational datasets are provided with a&#160;quality mask (Contractor et&#160;al., 2020), or the problematic data are either removed or corrected (Ashcroft et&#160;al., 2018). These are factors often taken into account in constructing regional climate information (Kotlarski et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.31" top="618.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="618.6" x1="557.31" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 315.07; y0: 618.6; y1: 628.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Quality-controlled data are now produced widely at the regional level, as in the case of sub-daily precipitation records in the United Kingdom (Blenkinsop et&#160;al., 2017) and the USA (Nelson et&#160;al., 2016). However, many more datasets and variables lack the same level of scrutiny (Alexander, 2016). Quality-controlled, high-resolution observational datasets are especially needed at regional and local scales to assess models as their resolution increases (Di Luca et&#160;al., 2016; Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017), although the awareness and appropriate use of the QC information is challenging (Tapiador et&#160;al., 2017) when generating regional climate information (</span><span style="x0: 457.51; x1: 462.09; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="457.51" y0="510.6" x1="514.51">high confidence</span><span x0="514.51" y0="510.6" x1="519.43" style="x0: 514.51; x1: 517.15; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="411.18" top="486.48"><span x0="309.26" y0="486.48" x1="411.18" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.06; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.2.2.2 Homogenization</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="462.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="462.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.71; y0: 462.6; y1: 472.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Homogenization aims to make data spatially and temporally &#8216;homogeneous&#8217;. Changes in a&#160;homogeneous time series are solely due to large-scale climatic changes (whether forced or due to internal variability). Station data are influenced by factors that act at regional scales, from the mesoscale and local scale down to the microscale (WMO, 2019). Station time series contain inhomogeneities such as artificial jumps or trends, which hamper assessments of regional long-term trends. Typical reasons for this are the urbanization of a&#160;station&#8217;s surroundings, which can lead to warming (Hamdi, 2010; Hansen et&#160;al., 2010; Adachi et&#160;al., 2012; Jones, 2016; Y. Sun et&#160;al., 2016), or relocations outside of the urban area, which could lead to cooling (Tuomenvirta, 2001; Yan et&#160;al., 2010; Xu et&#160;al., 2013; Dienst et&#160;al., 2017, 2019). Another potential source of inhomogeneity is a&#160;change in measurement methods that affect most instruments of an observational network over a&#160;limited time span, such as the transition to Stevenson screens (Parker, 1994; B&#246;hm et&#160;al., 2010; Brunet et&#160;al., 2011; Auchmann and Br&#246;nnimann, 2012) or to automatic weather stations (WMO, 2017b).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.33" top="246.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="246.6" x1="557.33" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 246.6; y1: 256.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The above examples have been selected as they are present in many stations and without going through homogenization they could potentially have influenced global land warming estimates (Section&#160;1.5.1). Single-break inhomogeneities tend to have a&#160;magnitude comparable to global climate change (Tuomenvirta, 2001; Venema et&#160;al., 2012) and are thus important for analyses of small regions. Also station records in national networks often have similar changes, making them important for national climate change estimates, but many of these influences are averaged out at the global scale (Jones, 2016).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.34" top="126.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="126.6" x1="557.34" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The main approach to reduce the influence of inhomogeneities in station observations is statistical homogenization by comparing the data from a&#160;candidate station with those of neighbouring reference stations in conjunction with the use of metadata (Trewin, 2010). This is a&#160;challenging task because both reference and candidate records normally have multiple inhomogeneities. Three challenges should be considered.
