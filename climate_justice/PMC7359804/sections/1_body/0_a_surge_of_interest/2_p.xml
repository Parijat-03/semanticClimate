<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0005">Research on transport and mobility justice has exploded in recent years, even though questions of uneven access to places and forms of movement have a long history in transport and urban research. Early examples include the use of physical accessibility as a social indicator of the ease with which different social groups can reach destinations and services for the evaluation of government policies (<xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Wachs and Kumagai, 1973</xref>) and the work on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, housing market discrimination and limited access to private vehicles hampered the opportunities of African-Americans in inner areas of US cities to access suburbanising employment (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Kain, 1968</xref>). Research has diversified in many ways since, including but not limited to: scholarship on spatial containment and entrapment of women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hanson and Pratt, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Preston and McLafferty, 2016</xref>); studies of the uneven distribution of the benefits and costs of transport subsidies, policies and infrastructure development (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hodge, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Hay, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Murray and Davis, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Foth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>); and work on how transport disadvantage and social exclusion interact with each other (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lucas, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
