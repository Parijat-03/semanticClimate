Other tools of importance when working at the intersection of climate change and mental health includes a free and gold standard tool used by child psychologists, The Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED) measurement instrument [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This tool can be utilized, and elaborated upon by integrating relevant questions from the Child Health BC&#8217;s updated Youth Health and Well-being Indicators (scheduled for release in 2021) [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], the validated Environmental Distress Scale [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the Canadian Index for Child Health and Wellbeing [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the Mental Health Indicators for Canada [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In taking an intersectionality and GBA+ approach, other important tools and processes include self-reporting of perceptions of health and engagement in maladaptive behaviors (as determined by the individual), as well as qualitative interviews. These can be conducted with children/youth, family members and allied public health promoters on the perceived impacts to children and youth&#8217;s mental health and reflections on the mechanisms of these attributions. Through individual and focus group interviews, rich descriptions can be triangulated with participant observations to fill gaps that other tools cannot fill. These key areas are crucial to understand in order to stave off despair, improve the health and wellbeing of children and youth, elevate their voices, and build and sustain healthy communities and a healthier future.</p>
