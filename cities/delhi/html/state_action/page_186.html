Chest pain, coughing, nausea, headaches and chest congestion are common symptoms. It can even worsen heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema. These impacts can be expected to further stress the public health system in the State. Ozone can also damage leaves and impede plant growth.  This figure clearly indicates a growing trend of temperature and ozone concentration in summer months in North India (including Delhi) (TERI, 2008). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="125.42" top="649.23"><span x0="72.02" y0="649.23" x1="125.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity</span><span x0="125.42" y0="649.23" x1="526.23" style="x0: 125.42; x1: 128.76; y0: 649.23; y1: 661.23; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: Heat stress in Delhi is amplified due to urban heat island effect. Mohan, et.al, 2011 show that urban heat island effect is most concentrated in commercial areas of Delhi, namely Connaught Place (Central Delhi), Sitaram Bazar (Old Delhi). These are followed by residential/mixed areas like Noida (NCR-South East Delhi), Dwarka (South-West Delhi), Janakpuri (West Delhi), Kaushambi (East Delhi), Adarsh Nagar (North Delhi). These areas are densely populated which also serves to increase surface temperature. The lowest urban heat island effect was found in Sanjay Van-HauzKhasDistt Park zone (South Delhi) and Buddha Jayanti Park-Moti Nagar zone (North Delhi) due to the existing greenery and open spaces in these areas (Mohan, et al., 2009).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="494.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="494.28" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 494.28; y1: 506.28; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Vector borne diseases like Dengue have been found to disproportionately affect densely populated parts of Delhi like Shahadra (Centre for Infectious Diseases, 2012) Areas like Shahadra clearly require greater allocation of resources towards mosquito eradication. Additionally, low lying areas near the Yamuna river bed, are at disproportionate risk of water logging and therefore increased intensity of disease outbreak (Bhattacharya, et al, 2006). South Delhi has about 30 percent of Delhi&#8217;s slum population and may therefore be more susceptible these disease outbreaks (Istyak and Kumar, 2010). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.41" top="371.26"><span x0="72.02" y0="371.26" x1="526.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 371.26; y1: 383.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">As can be expected, the concentration of Ozone is higher at busy traffic junctions. However as Ozone generally drifts towards periphery from city centre, the outskirts of Delhi may also be adversely impacted. This may hurt agricultural yield (concentrated in the periphery of Delhi), as ozone retards plant growth (CSE, 2009). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="169.34" top="295.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="295.78" x1="169.34" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 295.78; y1: 307.78; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Adaptive Capacity</span><span x0="169.34" y0="295.78" x1="526.06" style="x0: 169.34; x1: 172.68; y0: 295.78; y1: 307.78; width: 3.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: Mohan, et al. found that green spaces are more effective in reducing temperatures than water bodies. There are 7,784 hectares of forests in Delhi, with about 8,500 hectares earmarked for urban green spaces (parks, etc.) under the Delhi Master Plan 2021. (GNCTD, 2013) </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.38" top="220.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="220.27" x1="526.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 220.27; y1: 232.27; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are legally binding guidelines to ensure hygienic non-mosquito genic conditions in Delhi. Municipal corporations in Delhi also have a large mosquito eradication initiative. Additionally there are various awareness campaigns in schools, college and mass media on protection from these vector borne diseases. There are several measures being undertaken to reduce vehicle load on Delhi&#8217;s roads through incentivization of public transport, non-motorized transport, energy efficiency and cleaner fuel initiatives (National Urban Transport Policy, City Development Plan - Delhi). </span></div></body></html>
