Notably, migrants in South and Southeast Asia have been severely affected by the compounding crises of disasters and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and there is emerging evidence that inclusion of universal safety-net provisions that embed adaptation planning\ncan reduce vulnerabilities of migrants (Sengupta and Jha, 2020; Cundill et al., 2021; Sultana, 2021).</td>

      <td>While there is robust evidence (medium agreement) that migration exacerbates gendered vulnerability and work burdens (Banerjee et al.,\n2019; Singh, 2019; Rao et al., 2020), it is well established that differential vulnerability of migrants intersects with ethnicity, age and\ngender; political networks and social capital; and livelihoods in destination areas (Maharjan et al., 2020; Cundill et al., 2021). Across Asia,\ninternational and internal migration are changing social norms and household structures, with significant implications for local adaptive\ncapacity (Singh, 2019; Evertsen and van der Geest, 2020; Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020; Rao et al., 2020).</td>
