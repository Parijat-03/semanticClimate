<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par3">Works in the field of science studies have shown that social and cultural norms affect scientific theories, institutions, and practices thus challenging simple positivistic conceptions of science (Funtowicz and Ravetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>; Gibbons et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>; Putnam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>; Stengers and Lissack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>). Norms in the sustainability discourses are both ethical and techno-scientific and relate to relevant actors and entities at different scales&#8212;from global and national institutions to local communities and individuals. In our article, we analyze the three important documents produced in 2015 and look at how they structure and organize the ethical and techno-scientific norms that characterize current discourses in sustainability. The norms governing these documents define the broad social, political, and scientific direction of sustainability discourses and interventions in the near future (Nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Edenhofer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>).</p>
