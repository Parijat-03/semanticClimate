<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Corpus linguistics and cognitive linguistics have also been successfully combined, often with corpus data providing an additional testbed for existing cognitive linguistic theories <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_099" ref-type="bibr">(Grondelaers et al. 2007</xref>; see also <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">Arppe et&#160;al. [2010]</xref> and <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">Gries and Stefanowitsch [2006]</xref> for full discussion of the benefits and challenges of combining corpus-linguistic methodologies with cognitive theory). Cognitive linguistics also offers valuable insight into metaphor, instances of which can reliably be observed with the use of a corpus (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_076" ref-type="bibr">Semino 2017</xref>). The relationship between corpus frequency and specific cognitive processes such as entrenchment (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_074" ref-type="bibr">Schmid 2007</xref>), however, is not entirely certain, and has been complicated by methodological variation in how researchers measure both corpus frequency and processes including entrenchment (cf. <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_049" ref-type="bibr">Mehl 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, text frequency&#160;&#8211; one of the main affordances of corpus linguistics&#160;&#8211; can be interpreted as representing an exposure rate (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_092" ref-type="bibr">Wallis 2012</xref>), and the more a language user is exposed to a linguistic feature, the more the cognitive activation of that feature ought to become routinized or entrenched (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_074" ref-type="bibr">Schmid 2007</xref>: 119&#8211;120). This claim would apply to the entrenchment of linguistic frames or stories such as those around plastics and reuse.</p>
