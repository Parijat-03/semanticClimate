Interest in and evidence for the use of CAM approaches in general are greater in certain populations, as mentioned earlier. As the only profession for which a doctorate is accredited for CAM, NDs are an excellent member of the healthcare team for families who are particularly interested in this approach to health. Because NDs are trained in both the biomedical model and other paradigms of healthcare, they are well-positioned to bridge any gaps through deeper conversations around the interpretation of evidence for CAM approaches, and strategies for integrating the best of both worlds. </p>
