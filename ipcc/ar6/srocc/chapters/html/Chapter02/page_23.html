Glaciers also represent the most unstable stores of DDT in European and other mountain areas &#64258;anking large urban centres and glacier derived DDT is still accumulating in lake sediments downstream from glaciers (Bogdal et al., 2010). However, bio&#64258;occulation (the aggregation of dispersed organic particles by the action of organisms) can increase the residence time of these contaminants stored in glaciers thereby reducing their overall toxicity to freshwater ecosystems (Langford et al., 2010). Overall the effect on freshwater ecosystems of these contaminants is estimated to be low (</span><span style="x0: 207.33; x1: 214.19; y0: 615.54; y1: 625.04; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="207.33" y0="615.54" x1="278.8">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 278.8; x1: 281.44; y0: 615.54; y1: 625.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="278.8" y0="615.54" x1="312.97">) (Milner et al., 2017).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.96" top="579.54"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.73; y0: 579.54; y1: 589.04; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="579.54" x1="312.96">Of the heavy metals, mercury is of particular concern and an estimated 2.5 tonnes has been released by glaciers to downstream ecosystems across the Tibetan Plateau over the last 40 years (Zhang et al., 2012). Mercury in glacial silt, originating from grinding of rocks as the glacier &#64258;ows over them, can be as large or larger than the mercury &#64258;ux from melting ice due to anthropogenic sources deposited on the glacier&#160;(Zdanowicz et al., 2013). Both glacier erosion and atmospheric deposition contributed to the high rates of total mercury export found in a glacierised watershed in coastal Alaska (Vermilyea et al., 2017) and mercury output is predicted to increase in glacierised mountain catchments (Sun et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018b) (</span><span style="x0: 236.05; x1: 242.91; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="236.05" y0="459.56" x1="306.11">medium con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 306.11; x1: 308.75; y0: 459.56; y1: 469.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="306.11" y0="459.56" x1="312.96">). However, a key issue is how much of this glacier-derived mercury, largely in the particulate form, is converted to toxic methyl mercury downstream. Methyl mercury can be incorporated into aquatic food webs in glacier streams (Nagorski et al., 2014) and bio-magnify up the food chain (Lavoie et al., 2013). Water originating from rock glaciers can also contribute other heavy metals that exceed guideline values for drinking water quality (Thies et al., 2013). In addition, permafrost degradation can enhance the release of other trace elements (e.g.,&#160;aluminium, manganese and nickel) (Colombo et al., 2018). Indeed, projections indicate that all scenarios of future climate change will enhance the mobilisation of metals in metamorphic mountain catchments (Zaharescu et al., 2016).
