<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0120">Many of the knock-on effects of the pandemic are only starting to become visible and will continue to unfold over the coming years. This paper explores initial insights into the impacts of COVID-19 and discusses entry points for harnessing the recovery process for building more resilient and sustainable food systems. It is an outcome of the Consultative Science Platform launched by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the International Science Council (ISC), which explores the implications of the pandemic on various aspects of sustainable development. An initial background paper (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Sperling et al., 2020a</xref>), which outlined impacts of the pandemic and framed key issues for the recovery process, formed the basis for a series of discussion rounds with experts from academia, public and private sector and civil society between May and September 2020. The final report emerging from the expert feedback and supplementary literature reviews during this process (<xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">Sperling et al., 2020b</xref>) provides the foundation for this article, which has been further updated to capture additional developments in 2021.</p>
