We believe that science museums can become places for change and transformation, productive struggle, allyship, empathy, and epistemic democracy, and can serve as hybrid third spaces. Re-imagining institutional goals, spaces, and practices is difficult (but necessary) work (Pedretti &amp; Navas Iannini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>) and requires &#8220;a turn away from the self-referential museum functions of the past, towards a more complete externalisation of purpose&#8221; (Achiam &amp; S&#248;lberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>, p. 18). In other words, it is not enough that science museums exist for their own sake; they must also embrace their active exchange and co-production of knowledge within the societies in which they exist.</p>
