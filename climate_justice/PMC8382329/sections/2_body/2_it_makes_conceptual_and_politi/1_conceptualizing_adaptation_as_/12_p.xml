It may be recalled that achieving global social justice in an interdependent world was a central goal of President Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal in response to economic disruptions caused by the Great Depression. Achieving such a goal, Roosevelt argued at the opening of the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, required a multilateral response: &#8220;Economic diseases are highly communicable, [i]t follows, therefore, that the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbors, near and distant&#8221; (Roosevelt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1944</xref>). Climate change and Covid-19-induced economic distress affecting all countries are examples of such communicability.</p>
