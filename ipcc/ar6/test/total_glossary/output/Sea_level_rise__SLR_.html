<div class=""><h4 class="fw-bold fs-5 bg-primary text-light p-2">sea level rise</h4><dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><div><p class="definition" style="font-weight: bold">Change to the height of sea level, both globally and locally (relative&#160;sea level change) (at seasonal, annual or longer time scales) due to (1)&#160;a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass of water&#160;in the ocean (e.g., due to melt of glaciers and ice sheets), (2) changes&#160;in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water density (e.g.,<br>expansion under warmer conditions), (3) changes in the shape of the&#160;ocean basins and changes in the Earth&#8217;s gravitational and rotational&#160;fields and (4) local subsidence or uplift of the land.</p><p>Global mean&#160;sea level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is&#160;called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the<br>addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent&#160;(SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from&#160;changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced&#160;by temperature changes only are called thermosteric, while density&#160;changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic<br>and steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the&#160;shape of ocean basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and&#160;its distribution.</p></div></dd><div>
