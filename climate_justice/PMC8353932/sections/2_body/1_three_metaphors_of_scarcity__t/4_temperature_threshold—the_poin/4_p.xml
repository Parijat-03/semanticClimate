Since the TAR, the judgement of risk levels has been updated with each assessment cycle, reflecting new findings in climate science, which has generally shifted towards lower temperature over time (Zommers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>). For example, for the fifth type of RFCs (risks associated with large-scale singular events such as the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets), the temperature at which the risk level becomes &#8216;high&#8217; has fallen from ~5.5&#176;C in the TAR to &lt;2&#176;C in the SR15 (see Zommers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>).</p>
