Wealth and power cannot fully protect one from disease (as the recent White House coronavirus outbreak makes clear) (Margolin and Bruggeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). However, who is affected by pandemics (and climate change) and to what extent they&#8217;re affected is influenced by the power dynamics in society. To put matters into perspective: Reporting from the National Urban League found that Black Americans have been infected with coronavirus at three times the rate of white Americans,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> and are twice as likely to die from the virus. The communities hardest hit by coronavirus have been struggling with public health (Mulholland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Cha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">b</xref>), economic, and environmental-justice issues since long before coronavirus brought society to a halt. The pandemic has only exacerbated these conditions. Indeed, emerging research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has found a link between air pollution and the lethality of coronavirus.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> These findings are consistent with the lived reality on the ground in places like the Navajo Nation, prisons and ICE detention centers, and farmworker communities in California.</p>
