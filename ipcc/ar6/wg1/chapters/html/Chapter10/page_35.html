However, this is not necessarily true if the domain is large enough because the RCM and its biases will then control the circulation leading to a&#160;biased performance with regard to storm characteristics (Pontoppidan et&#160;al., 2019). An ensemble of 12 RCMs with and without air-sea coupling reasonably reproduced the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones, and air-sea coupling had a&#160;rather weak impact (Flaounas et&#160;al., 2018). Over the Gulf Stream, however, air-sea coupling played an important role in representing cyclone development (Vries et&#160;al., 2019). Sanchez-Gomez and Somot (2018) showed that the effect of RCM internal variability on density of cyclone tracks is very significant and larger than for other variables such as precipitation. It is larger in summer than in winter, in particular over the Iberian Peninsula, northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, which are regions of enhanced cyclogenesis during the warm season.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="66.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="66.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 66.6; y1: 76.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Biases in the representation of large-scale atmospheric circulation can result in biased representation of regional climate.

Munday and Washington (2018) relate CMIP5 model rainfall biases over South Africa to anomalous low-level moisture transport across high topography due to upstream wind biases and inaccurate representation of unresolved orographic drag effects. Addor et&#160;al. (2016) show that the overestimated frequency of westerly synoptic situations was a&#160;significant contributor to the wet bias in several RCMs in winter over Switzerland. Pepler et&#160;al. (2014, 2016) suggest that better capturing westerly-driven synoptic systems such as cold fronts and cut-off lows in climate models could be key in simulating the observed pattern correlation between rainfall and zonal wind in southern south-east Australia. Cannon (2020) shows global improvement in performance going from CMIP5 to CMIP6 for both frequency and persistence of circulation types.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="522.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="522.6" x1="563.23" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The robust quantification of the influence of atmospheric circulation errors on regional climate remains a&#160;challenge as many parametrized processes such as cloud radiative effects and soil moisture or snow feedbacks can also contribute and interact with the circulation errors. Atmospheric nudging experiments where the simulated circulation is constrained to be close to that observed have been used to separate the circulation effect from other contributions to regional climate biases (Wehrli et&#160;al., 2018). The nudging approach requires detailed and careful implementation in order to limit detrimental effects due to the added tendency term in the model equations (Zhang et&#160;al., 2014; Lin et&#160;al., 2016). Based on single-model experiments, Wehrli et&#160;al. (2018) show that the circulation induced biases are often not the main contributors to mean and extreme temperature and precipitation biases for many regions and seasons.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="347.12" top="342.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="342.6" x1="347.12" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 349.16; x1: 353.74; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="349.16" y0="342.6" x1="410.47">high confidence </span><span x0="412.5" y0="342.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 412.5; x1: 415.31; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that atmospheric circulation biases can deteriorate the model representation of regional land surface climate.
