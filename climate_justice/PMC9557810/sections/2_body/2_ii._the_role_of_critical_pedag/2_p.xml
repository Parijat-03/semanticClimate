<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">While this body of research often refers to &#8220;popular urbanization&#8221; and &#8220;popular
urbanism&#8221; as interchangeable notions, we argue for recognizing their difference.
Popular urbanization pertains to the processes by which low-income and marginalized
women and men typically produce and appropriate the urban territory. In contrast,
popular urbanism &#8211; the arena in which the schools thrive and the focus of the
present paper &#8211; refers to a domain of practice that contests the institutional power
of urbanism as a discipline, and the legitimacy it enjoys in producing knowledge and
practices. Thus, popular urbanism encapsulates a collective intentionality to
reclaim the authority and legitimacy of other ways of producing and using the city
as a commons; the ability to craft a different relationship with state institutions
across periods of dictatorship and (re)democratization<sup>(<xref rid="fn8-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">8</xref>)</sup> and conscious and explicit
efforts to valorize the experiences, pedagogies and principles that have redressed
social and environmental inequalities and injustices over time, and that continue to
do so.</p>
