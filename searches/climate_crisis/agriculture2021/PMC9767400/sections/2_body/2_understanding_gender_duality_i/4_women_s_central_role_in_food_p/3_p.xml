<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0055">Entrenched gender norms limit women's opportunities in different ways in the agricultural sphere. Gender norms often designate men as heads of the household, which means men having control over household decision-making. This includes decision-making regarding resources, including household income and expenditure (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Hillenbrand and Miruka, 2019</xref>). Another common gender barrier women face in rural areas are mobility restrictions, which makes women more bound to their home area (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Diiro et al., 2018</xref>). Also, in the economic system women face inherent gender biases, which limits their access to credit. Especially smallholder female farmers face difficulties in getting loans, because of social norms and lack of collateral (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2019b</xref>). This in turn influences women farmers opportunities to buy productive assets that increase crop yield.</p>
