Consistency between observed and simulated historical trends is also assessed with statistical tests that can be applied independently over a&#160;large number of grid points. The fraction of area over a&#160;given region where the change is classified as detectable, attributable, or consistent/inconsistent, is then finally estimated. The method can be viewed as a&#160;simple consistency test for both amplitude and pattern of observed versus simulated trends. Its application to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models suggests that 80% of the Earth&#8217;s surface has a&#160;detectable anthropogenic warming signal (Knutson et&#160;al., 2013). Regarding regional land precipitation changes over the 1901&#8211;2010 and 1951&#8211;2010 periods, application of the univariate detection method based on CMIP5 models suggests attributable anthropogenic changes at several locations such as increases over regions of the north-central USA, southern Canada, Europe, and southern South America and decreases over parts of the Mediterranean region, northern tropical Africa and south-western Australia (Delworth and Zeng, 2014; Knutson and Zeng, 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="486.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="486.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.19; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Another regional attribution technique is based on the similarity of past changes between observations and one or several simulations of&#160;a&#160;large ensemble that share the same time evolution for a&#160;suggested driver of these changes. Huang et&#160;al. (2020b) used a&#160;perturbed physics ensemble to attribute the drying trend of the Indian monsoon over the latter half of the 20th&#160;century to decadal forcing from the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Annex IV.2.6). The ensemble members predicted different trends in PDV behaviour across the 20th&#160;century and the negative precipitation trend was only replicated in those members with a&#160;strong negative-to-positive PDV transition across the 1970s, consistent with the observed PDV behaviour (see also the detailed case study in Section&#160;10.6.3). In a&#160;similar manner, Cvijanovic et&#160;al. (2017) addressed the possible influence of Arctic sea ice loss on the North Pacific pressure ridge and, consequently, on south-western USA precipitation. They sampled the uncertainties in selected sea ice physics parameters to achieve a&#160;&#8216;low Arctic sea ice&#8217; state in their perturbed simulations. They then compared the latter with control simulations representative of sea ice conditions at the end of the 20th&#160;century to assess changes purely due to sea ice loss.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.78" top="246.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="246.6" x1="298.78" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 56.55; y0: 246.6; y1: 256.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">New methods aiming to remove underlying model biases before performing detection and attribution, for instance related to precipitation changes, are emerging based on image transformation techniques such as warping (Levy et&#160;al., 2014a). By correcting location and seasonal precipitation biases in CMIP5 models, Levy et&#160;al. (2014b) showed that the agreement between observed and fingerprint patterns can be improved, further enhancing the ability to attribute observed precipitation changes to external forcings. The improvement mainly relies on the assumption that precipitation changes are tied to the underlying climatology, which has been shown to be a&#160;reasonable assumption in regions of the world where intensification of the hydrological cycle is expected (Held and Soden,&#160;2006).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="90.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="90.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Importantly, evidence that the models employed in regional-scale attribution are fit for purpose is essential in order to estimate the degree of confidence in the attribution results (Section&#160;10.3.3).

Abundant rainfall in the 1950s&#8211;1960s was followed by a&#160;large negative trend (Figure&#160;10.11b) until at least the 1980s, over which annual rainfall fell by 20&#8211;30% (Hulme, 2001). The subsequent partial recovery (B. Wang et&#160;al., 2021) is more uncertain: rain-gauge studies suggest a&#160;return to long-term positive anomalies in the western Sahel in the early 2000s (Panthou et&#160;al., 2018), while CHIRPS merged satellite/gauge data show a&#160;wetter western Sahel since 1981 (Bichet and Diedhiou, 2018a,&#160;b). The recovery has been more significant over the central rather than the western Sahel (Lebel and Ali, 2009; Maidment et&#160;al., 2015; Sanogo et&#160;al., 2015) and a&#160;multiple-gauge record supports a&#160;greater recovery to the eastern side (Nicholson et&#160;al., 2018). In this attribution example, drivers of the long-term drought and subsequent partial recovery are discussed, including anthropogenic GHG and aerosol emissions, and sea surface temperature (SST) variations that, in part, relate to internal variability. The reader is also referred to assessment in Section&#160;8.3.2.4. We define the Sahel within 10&#176;N&#8211;20&#176;N across to 30&#176;E, consistent with the eastern boundary used in Chapter&#160;8, and the rainy season as spanning June to September.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.28" top="90.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="90.6" x1="557.28" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The role of SST forcing in the rainfall decline is assessed first.
