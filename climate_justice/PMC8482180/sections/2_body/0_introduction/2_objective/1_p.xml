In the digital age, citizen science can revolutionize ethical data collection, engagement, and knowledge mobilization. The Food Equity and Environmental Data Sovereignty (FEEDS) Project takes a participatory action, citizen science approach for early detection and warning of climate change impacts on food security, sovereignty, and solastalgia. The objective of this project is to customize and implement a sustainable digital platform that enables real-time decision-making and engagement among community members, decision makers, and researchers. On the basis of the principles of Two-Eyed Seeing [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], this study aims to partner with Indigenous communities for early detection and management of climate change as it relates to probable impacts on food systems and human health using a digital rapid response platform. This paper describes the FEEDS Project protocol and its application in a subarctic Indigenous community in Canada.</p>
