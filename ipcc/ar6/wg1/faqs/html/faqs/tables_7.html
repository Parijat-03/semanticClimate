      <td>FAQ 1.1, Figure 1 | Sample elements of climate understanding, observations and models as assessed in the IPCC First Assessment Report\n(1990) and Sixth Assessment Report (2021). Many other advances since 1990, such as key aspects of theoretical understanding, geological records and\nattribution of change to human influence, are not included in this figure because they are not readily represented in this simple format. Fuller explanations of\nthe history of climate knowledge are available in the introductory chapters of the IPCC Fourth and Sixth assessment reports.</td>
