Gazetted on 1 June 2019, the instrument is hinged on the &#8216;polluter pays&#8217; notion where those culpable of atmospheric depletion ought to bear the cost. As a carbon-pricing mechanism, the primary focus of the instrument is the private sector, mainly industries, and individuals. Three forms of emissions are taxable: those from (i) industrial processes; (ii) fugitive emissions; and (iii) fuel combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The Act is operationalized in two phases. According to section&#160;5 of the Act, the first phase spans from 1 June 2019 to 31 December 2022. Within this duration, levies are imposed on direct (scope 1) emitters, which include companies and industries which directly burn coal. With an initial tax rate of R120 (approx. $8) per tone of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent of the GHGs of the company, the levy can be cut down to up to 95% following a trend of performance incentives, allowances, and tax breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Since the imposition of the tax, there have been considerable hikes in fuel prices, with diesel increasing by 10c/l and petrol by 9c/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Ultimately, these price increases have trickled down to young consumers as food and basic commodities are affected by hikes in transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The second phase of CTA is scheduled to commence in 2023. This period is projected to witness an increase in revenue collection. At this stage, the rate of R120 is projected to escalate annually by the consumer price inflation plus 2% of the standard rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
