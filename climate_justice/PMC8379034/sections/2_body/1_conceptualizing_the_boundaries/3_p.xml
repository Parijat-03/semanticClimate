For instance, if one were to examine the World Economic Forum&#8217;s Global Risk Reports since the publication of its first report in 2006, all five categories of global environmental risks (&#8220;extreme weather events and temperatures; accelerating biodiversity loss; pollution of air, soil and water; failures of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and risks linked to the transition to low carbon&#8221;) have risen in terms of their risk profile (Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>).</p>
