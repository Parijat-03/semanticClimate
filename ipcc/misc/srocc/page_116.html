For example, agricultural policy might be concerned with food security, but have little concern for environmental protection or human health. As food, energy and water security and the conservation of biodiversity rank highly on the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the promotion of synergies between and across sectoral policies is important (IPBES 2018a). This can also reduce the risks of anthropogenic climate forcing through mitigation, and bring greater collaboration between scientists, policymakers, the private sector and land managers in adapting to climate change (FAO 2015a). Polycentric governance (Section&#160;7.6) has emerged as an appropriate way of handling resource management problems, in which the decision-making centres take account of one another in competitive and cooperative relationships and have recourse to con&#64258;ict resolution mechanisms (Carlisle and Gruby 2017). Polycentric governance is also multi-scale and allows the interaction between actors at different levels (local, regional, national and global) in managing common pool resources such as forests or aquifers.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="411.56" x1="307.6">Implementation of systemic, nexus approaches has been achieved through socio-ecological systems (SES) frameworks that emerged from studies of how institutions affect human incentives, actions and outcomes (Ostrom and Cox 2010). Recognition of the importance of SES laid the basis for alternative formulations to tackle the sustainable management of land resources focusing speci&#64257;cally on institutional and governance outcomes (Lebel et al.&#160;2006; Bodin 2017). The SES approach also addresses the multiple scales in which the social and ecological dimensions interact (Veldkamp et al.&#160;2011; Myers et al.&#160;2016; Azizi et al.&#160;2017) (Section&#160;6.1).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.62" top="279.58"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 279.58; y1: 289.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="279.58" x1="307.62">Adaptation or resilience pathways within the SES frameworks require several attributes, including indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) and trust building for deliberative decision-making and effective collective action, polycentric and multi-layered institutions and responsible authorities that pursue just distributions of bene&#64257;ts to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups and communities (Lebel et al.&#160;2006). The nature, source and mode of knowledge generation are critical to ensure that sustainable solutions are community-owned and fully integrated within the local context (Mistry and Berardi 2016; Schneider and Buser 2018). Integrating ILK with scienti&#64257;c information is a&#160;prerequisite for such community-owned solutions (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;13 in Chapter&#160;7). ILK is context-speci&#64257;c, transmitted orally or through imitation and demonstration, adaptive to changing environments, and collectivised through a&#160;shared social memory (Mistry and Berardi 2016). ILK is also holistic since indigenous people do not seek solutions aimed at adapting to climate change alone, but instead look for solutions to increase their resilience to a&#160;wide range of shocks and stresses (Mistry and Berardi 2016). ILK can be deployed in the practice of </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="735.62"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 321.75; y0: 735.62; y1: 745.12; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.62" x1="566.09">climate governance, especially at the local level where actions are informed by the principles of decentralisation and autonomy (Chanza and de Wit 2016). ILK need not be viewed as needing con&#64257;rmation or disapproval by formal science, but rather it can complement scienti&#64257;c knowledge (Klein et al.&#160;2014).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="663.62"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 663.62; y1: 673.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="663.62" x1="566.08">The capacity to apply individual policy instruments and policy mixes is in&#64258;uenced by governance modes. These modes include hierarchical governance that is centralised and imposes policy through top-down measures, decentralised governance in which public policy is devolved to regional or local government, public-private partnerships that aim for mutual bene&#64257;ts for the public and private sectors and self or private governance that involves decisions beyond the realms of the public sector (IPBES 2018a). These governance modes provide both constraints and opportunities for key actors that impact the effectiveness, ef&#64257;ciency and equity of policy implementation.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="544.53" top="519.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 519.42; y1: 529.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="519.42" x1="544.53">1.4.2 Gender agency as a&#160;critical factor in climate and&#160;land sustainability outcomes</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="483.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.45; y0: 483.52; y1: 493.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="483.52" x1="566.09">Environmental resource management is not gender neutral. Gender is an essential variable in shaping ecological processes and change, building better prospects for livelihoods and sustainable development (Resurrecci&#243;n 2013) (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11 in Chapter&#160;7). Entrenched legal and social structures and power relations constitute additional stressors that render women&#8217;s experience of natural resources disproportionately negative when compared to men. Socio-economic drivers and entrenched gender inequalities affect land-based management (Agarwal 2010). The intersections between climate change, gender and climate adaptation takes place at multiple scales: household, national and international, and adaptive capacities are shaped through power and knowledge.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="327.54"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.86; y0: 327.54; y1: 337.04; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="327.54" x1="566.07">Germaine to the gender inequities is the unequal access to land-based resources. Women play a&#160;signi&#64257;cant role in agriculture (Boserup 1989; Darity 1980) and rural economies globally (FAO 2011), but are well below their share of labour in agriculture globally (FAO 2011). In 59% of 161 surveyed countries, customary, traditional and religious practices hinder women&#8217;s land rights (OECD 2014). Moreover, women typically shoulder disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic work including care-giving activities (Beuchelt and Badstue 2013) and the provision of water and &#64257;rewood (UNEP 2016). Exposure to violence restricts, in large regions, their mobility for capacity-building activities and productive work outside the home (Day et al.&#160;2005; UNEP 2016). Large-scale development projects can erode rights, and lead to over-exploitation of natural resources. Hence, there are cases where reforms related to land-based management, instead of enhancing food security, have tended to increase the vulnerability of both women and men and reduce their ability to adapt to climate change (Pham et al.&#160;2016). Access to, and control over, land and land-based resources is essential in taking concrete action on land-based mitigation, and inadequate access can affect women&#8217;s rights and participation in land governance and management of productive assets.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="75.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.26; y0: 75.58; y1: 85.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="75.58" x1="566.09">Timely information, such as from early warning systems, is critical in managing risks, disasters, and land degradation, and in enabling </span></div></body></html>
