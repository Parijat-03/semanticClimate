The villagers can no longer survive in the rising waters of the rainy season and sea level rise. Yet, they have no place to go, and poor governance has been a major hindrance to their climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.Their return to Casamance as refugees/migrants is not an option, as the region is fraught with a long-term civil war, and there is little chance of them finding another territory (besides that usurped by Arame) in Guinea-Bissau in which to settle, as formerly vacant land across the country is now occupied by cashew trees (Temudo &amp; Abrantes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). In summary, there is an urgent need for the state to guarantee the human rights of Djobel's inhabitants, to put an end to the inter-village conflict (which can be only achieved through the disarmament of Arame and Cassu farmers<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> and the expulsion of the Casamance rebels from the Guinea-Bissau territory), to support the resettlement of Djobel's inhabitants in their traditional upland territory, and to conduct georeferencing and create an official register of the villages' territories (conducted with the mediation of elders and religious and political authorities of other Djola villages).</p>
