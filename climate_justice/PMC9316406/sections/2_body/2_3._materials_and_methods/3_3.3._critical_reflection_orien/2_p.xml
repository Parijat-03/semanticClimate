This weekly communication approach allowed them to share and critique each other&#8217;s reflections. This critique process inspired them to re-investigate their teaching&#8211;training&#8211;learning and research&#8211;practice interventions and explore the necessary GSW-specific knowledge and skills to improve their micro-, mezzo-, and macro-level practice. Moreover, the third-party feedback from other students in the MSW research methods course, from the field education facilitator&#8217;s evaluation (at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the placement), and from the audience of conference presentations, invited talks, and guest presentations in the research methods course, were all integrated into the weekly critique, further stimulating critical reflection and evaluation, and eventually promoting the richness of this critical-refection-based data curation. </p>
