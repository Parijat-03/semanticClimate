<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Recent studies indicate that environmental sciences are a predominant research topic in the citizen science landscape (Follett and Strezov, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Moczek et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, many of these analyses associate each project with only one main research area (Follett and Strezov, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lukyanenko et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), neglecting the multi-disciplinary nature of many projects. In a meso level study, which included a sample of all CS projects listed on the Zooniverse platform (<italic>n</italic> = 218), we have investigated the multi-disciplinarity nature of projects through an assessment of research areas within a subset of projects in the CS Track database.</p>
