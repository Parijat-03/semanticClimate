All these climatic risks, when overlaid on existing\ndevelopment deficits, show us that incremental adaptation will not be enough; transformational change is\nrequired. Recognising this, at subnational and national levels, government and non-governmental actors are also\nprioritising planned adaptation strategies which include interventions like &#8216;climate-smart agriculture&#8217; as seen in South\nand Southeast Asian countries, or changing labour laws to reduce exposure to heat as seen in West Asia. These are\noften sectoral priorities governments lay out through national or subnational policies and projects, drawing on\nvarious sources of funding: domestic, bilateral and international. Apart from these planned adaptation strategies in\nsocial systems, Asian countries also report and invest in adaptation measures in natural systems such as expanding\nnature reserves to enable species conservation or setting up habitat corridors to facilitate landscape connectivity</td>

Another example is India&#8217;s Heat Action Plans that are using\n&#8216;cool roofs&#8217; technologies and awareness-building campaigns to reduce the impacts of extreme heat. Across South\nand Southeast Asia, climate-smart agriculture programmes are reducing GHG emissions associated with farming\nwhile helping farmers adapt to changing risks. Each country is experimenting with infrastructural, nature-based,\ntechnological, institutional and behavioural strategies to adapt to current and future climate change with local\ncontexts shaping both the possibility of undertaking such actions as well as the effectiveness of these actions to\nreduce risk. What works for ageing cities in Japan exposed to heatwaves and floods may not work for pastoral\ncommunities in the highlands of Central Asia, but there is progress on understanding what actions work and for\nwhom. The challenge is to scale current adaptation action, especially in the most exposed areas and for the most\nvulnerable populations, as well as move beyond adapting to single risks alone (i.e., adapt to multiple coinciding\nrisks such as flooding and water scarcity in coastal cities across South Asia or extreme heat and flash floods in\nWest Asia). In this context, funding and implementing adaptation is essential, and while Asian countries are\nexperimenting with a range of autonomous and planned adaptation actions to deal with these multiple and often\nconcurrent challenges, making current development pathways climate resilient is necessary and, some might argue,\nunavoidable.</td>
