Increasingly, climate litigation brought against governments and corporations utilizes international human rights, environmental and climate laws and policies to seek accountability for climate-destructive and health-harming actions. The health impacts of climate change make litigation an important means of pursuing justice and strategically challenging legal systems. Yet there is scant documentation in the literature of the role that public health has played in climate litigation and the legal weight public health narratives are given in such contexts. Therefore, we assessed to what extent courts of law have used public health harm in legal adjudication and sought to provide practical recommendations to address barriers to positioning legal arguments in public health-centric frames.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We reviewed legal databases to identify all publicly reported, documented, cases of climate litigation filed in any country or jurisdiction between 1990 and September 2020.

Resolution remains pending in over half of cases as the majority were initiated in the past three years. Cases were primarily based in climate and human rights law and brought by a wide range of groups and individuals predominantly against governments. About half of the decided cases found in favour for the plaintiffs. Based on this, we selected the 65 cases that were directly linked to public health. We found economic forces and pricing of health risks play a key role, as courts are challenged by litigants to adjudicate on the responsibility for health impacts.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While courts of law are receptive to public health science, significant legal reform is needed to enhance leveraging of public health evidence in legal judgements of climate litigation cases. The integration of a public health mandate into a new eco-centric legal paradigm will optimize its potential to promote human well-being&#x02014;the core objective underpinning both international law, human rights, and public health. Existing legal doctrines and practices can be enhanced to increase the weight of public health arguments in climate legal action and consequently ensure legal rulings in climate litigation prioritize, protect and promote public health.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific or any funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="31"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data used to develop this report is publicly available on the respective case law databases of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/</ext-link>), and the Sabin Center for Climate Change law (<ext-link xlink:href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://climate.law.columbia.edu/</ext-link>).

Escalating Climate Change impacts across the world is increasing potential for litigation to be brought against corporations, governments, and other parties by individuals and communities on the basis of current or future harm to their health and wellbeing. This risk of legal liability is a key factor in shaping climate-compliant economies whereby actors seek to protect assets, minimize risk and seek opportunities that are within the boundaries of legal regulatory frameworks.</p><p>As the field of climate litigation has evolved, so have the legal strategies used to prosecute claims of wrongdoing. Only in the last few years have cases emerged from all areas of law including corporate law, financial law, and human rights, as strategic tools in the pursuit of litigation against climate-disruptive actions by corporations, governments, and other parties. The rising trends in litigation have been monitored and recorded by various scholars [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268633.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With growing evidence of the health impacts resulting from climate change, it is unsurprising that public health concerns now feature more strongly in litigation. Yet there is scant documentation in the literature characterizing the role that public health arguments have played in climate litigation and the legal weight given to public health narratives.</p><p>Despite solid scientific evidence and the efforts of many, global greenhouse gas emissions are not reducing [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, despite environmental protection laws, environmental damage is demonstrably escalating as ecosystems decay is generating a sixth mass extinction [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The human species cannot flourish amid sick ecosystems. Healthy environments and a stable climate are necessary for human survival. Their disruption directly harms human health.</p><p>In recognizing that climate change is unfolding as a health emergency that disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable, health professionals are urging for accelerating efforts to decarbonize [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Accordingly, the public health community has increasingly issued calls for a &#x0201c;public health focussed response&#x0201d; across prevention, mitigation, adaptation, and preparedness [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Central to this approach is the need to ensure that viable legal avenues for deterring, halting, and seeking justice for climate-disruptive, health-threatening actions exist. To support this objective, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of public health in climate litigation and provides practical recommendations to address barriers to positioning legal arguments in public health-centric frames.</p><p>Climate Litigation reveals the ways in which the threats of litigation can shape the transition to an economy which is not based on environmentally-devastating anthropogenic activities. Therefore, there is an urgent need for individuals, groups, stakeholders, and consumers to bring litigation that is correlated to a public health concern. Although litigation is often a lengthy, stressful and costly process, it may force governments and corporations to prioritize planetary and human health over profit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec006"><title>Background</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Climate change and human health</title><p>Since its identification as a growing environmental threat, climate change has generated concern from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Only relatively recently has the public health perspective gained traction within the broader climate policy dialogue.</p><p>There is now robust data to substantiate the claim that climate change significantly and negatively impacts human health both directly and indirectly through a series of complex, interacting social and environmental determinants.

Yet as stated in the Lancet Commission on the Legal Determinants of Health, &#x0201c;While law can be a powerful tool for advancing global health, it remains substantially underutilised and poorly understood. Working in partnership, public health lawyers and health professionals can become champions for evidence-based laws to ensure the public&#x02019;s health and safety&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Law is a powerful tool to advance global health because climate change adversely affects the physical health and mental health of people in all countries [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many indigenous peoples and local communities [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Yet, according to the World Economic Forum &#x0201c;groups of stakeholders (the private sector, corporate and financial organizations) have taken part in a system that funds the destruction of nature&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is enabled by a rule of law, which more often gives primacy to corporate rights over the health of nature. Using scientific evidence, namely climate science and public health, law can advance health, human rights, and the rights of nature.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Climate law, policies and economic incentives</title><p>Climate laws and policies are concerned with &#x02018;mitigating, regulating or adapting&#x02019; industrial activity which causes climate change. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed by 154 states in 1992 acknowledging &#x0201c;that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate response&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both the Paris Agreement [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP21) and the &#x0201c;UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&#x0201d; have guided development in this field. Although, health is not always specifically articulated in national laws and policies that address economic regulations on energy, electric utilities, construction, agriculture and industry, it is commonly implicit that the objective of these policies is human and planetary ecosystem survival. The evidential failure of <italic toggle="yes">implied</italic> protection of planetary health, stability of the climate and human health through existing laws provides a powerful argument that such protections must be made <italic toggle="yes">explicit</italic> and legally binding. For most nations the legal basis exists as in 2015, 193 nations endorsed the SDGs including SDG 3, which aims to &#x0201c;ensure healthy lives and to promote well-being for all ages&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the Paris Agreement, endorsed by 196 countries, emphasizes the &#x0201c;right to health&#x0201d;. Whereas the SDGs are not legally binding, the Paris Agreement is. [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Yet with few legal teeth, it does not impose penalties, such as fees or embargos, for parties that violate its terms, and there is no international court or governing body ready to enforce compliance. Experts argue that in reality, the Paris Agreement is not legally binding [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The emerging field of climate law is inter-disciplinary and extends to often unsatisfactorily defined concepts such as a &#x02018;carbon net zero economy&#x02019; and &#x02018;sustainable finance&#x02019;. Since 1992, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Finance Initiative (FI) has partnered with the global financial services sector including banks, insurers, and investors in a commitment that &#x0201c;we &#x02026; recognize that economic development needs to be compatible with human welfare and a healthy environment&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Yet whilst older environmental regulations have provided legal avenues to petition for public health justice, they have been hindered by the economic ideology that profit trumps health, ecology, and ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Public health, the environment, and law</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Environmental health-related legal frameworks</title><p>A relevant legal framework with implications for environmental health promotion is the International Environmental Law (IEL).

The resource management and pollution control components which comprise this framework make it inherently linked to public health objectives, despite there being no explicit mention of human health in many IEL statutes [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In October 2021, the United Nations, Human Rights Council (HRC), recognized that having a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a human right, however this is not a legally binding obligation [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Relevant IEL statutes include &#x0201c;The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment&#x0201d; (the 1972 Stockholm Declaration) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and &#x0201c;The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development&#x0201d; (the Rio Earth Summit) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Inherent in both statutes is the legal mandate to prevent, wherever possible, the degradation or depletion of environmental resources needed to sustain planetary life. In both declarations, one can observe an anthropocentric focus on human health and the prevention of environmentally destructive actions which would be detrimental to it, namely those which interfere with life sustaining ecosystem services, as defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>International Human Rights Law (IHRL), like IEL, features an implicit focus on human health and well-being, albeit through the imposition of protective policies against abusive acts which could threaten any one of its many sub-domains. There are notable areas where IHRL and IEL intersect to promote a policy environment conducive to human health. For example, climate-friendly policies are increasingly being linked to our moral duty to uphold Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which states that &#x0201c;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person&#x0201d;&#x02014;rights which climate destructive actions explicitly threaten. Yet &#x0201c;environmental law continues to struggle with the complaint that it re-articulates some of the patterns of colonial exploitation in environmental terms&#x0201d;, most notably by treating nature&#x02019;s resources as mere commodities and by failing to provide an enabling framework for indigenous populations to regain rightful stewardship over their lands [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Hence, reconciling environmental and human rights law remains an ongoing process, one which will arguably be central to creating a health-friendly legislative environment in the years to come.</p><p>On a national level, Environmental Law consists of statutes, regulations, applied common law, and in some countries, constitutional provisions. Currently, 155 countries have binding legal obligations to respect, protect and fulfill the right to a healthy environment [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Environmental rights consist of procedural rights (e.g. access to information, access to justice, right to participate in environmental decision making) and substantive rights (i.e. civil and political, economic and social, cultural, and collective rights) which implicate legal requisites to preventing environmental degradation [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Mapping the landscape within which environmental health features in international law also requires an understanding of International Health Regulations (IHR) which, in principle, embody a legal commitment of governments to respond to environmental health threats. The IHR are legally-binding for all 194 WHO member states and include requirements to report public health events with potential to cross borders and to maintain core capacities for preparedness, surveillance and response [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Consequentially, it can be said that obligations under the IHR imply a commitment to sound governance in response to environmental health emergencies which, by nature, have high potential to transcend international borders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Climate change litigation</title><p>Litigation is defined as &#x0201c;the act, process, or practice of settling a dispute in court of law&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. What is often disputed in climate litigation, is whether governments or market actors are &#x02018;mitigating, regulating or adapting&#x02019; industrial activity which causes climate change. According to the IPCC [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], system change is required across all industrial sectors to substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Litigants and lawyers use such statements to support litigation and in recent years, individuals and communities have aligned their causes of social, human and economic justice with environmental and climate justice. Indeed, the Paris Agreement notes &#x0201c;the importance for some of the concept of climate justice, when taking action &#x02026;&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Legal Liability is defined as the <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;responsibility that someone has for their actions</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">for example the responsibility to pay another person for harm or damage that is the result of these actions&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Climate laws and policies create new legal liability for market actors, but there is increasing evidence that polluting industries impose health burdens on their neighbors and that these risks are higher for black, brown, indigenous and poor communities [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As indicated in the cases discussed below, liability is sought not only using climate statutes, but using all areas of the law including corporate, financial, constitutional, and human rights.</p><p>Given the empirical grounding of CCL, climate attribution science is now playing an increasingly important role. By adopting epidemiological methodologies of quantifying proportional risk, climate attribution science &#x0201c;aims to establish the relationship between anthropogenic emissions and specific extreme weather events&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As climate science has matured in the past decade, climate attribution methodologies are now increasingly capable of providing evidence to demonstrate causation and responsibility. By calculating the strength of the causal relationship, attribution studies bolster empirical arguments underpinning legal claims by allowing for evidence on proportional responsibility. The UNEP 2020 global status review on climate litigation suggested that climate attribution is being given more weight in the consideration of cases and determination of legally enforceable outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>There are several types of detection and attribution studies focusing on: trends or long-term changes in climate variables; changes in extremes; weather or climate events; climate-related impacts; and the estimation of climate sensitivity using observational constraints. Detection and attribution studies can be done at various scales ranging from regional to global [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>CCL includes both (a) cases where the claim is based on an established law, for which compliance/enforcement is sought, and (b) cases where there is no established law, but claimants assert that there ought to be (e.g. through expanding the scope of existing constitutional mandates, human rights statues, common law principals, etc). CCL has often been pursued through the international legal pathways of multilateral institutions and the United Nations system, drawing upon such doctrines as The Convention on the Rights of the Child, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Organizations, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, amongst others.</p><p>In the European Union (EU), litigation has often been orchestrated via reference to the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the EU in addition to other relevant national/ international laws [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the United States, CCL has been brought at both federal and state levels [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Most CCL has been against governments, but cases have been increasingly against corporate entities in relation to a widening array of financial, company, and corporate planning laws [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. With growing requirements for corporate adherence to Environmental and Social Governance Standards (ESG&#x02019;s), litigation against corporations is likely to increase in frequency in future.</p><p>Interestingly, eco-centric law is becoming a reimagination of the anthropocentric foundations of the international legal system. Eco-centric concepts are transforming human-centered legal systems, that historically undervalue non-human life. This is based on newly articulated eco-centric ideas that &#x0201c;to treat nature as just one of several competing (economic) interests results in a tendency to trump more qualitative public interest notions, such as ecosystem protection, intergenerational and intragenerational equity and even cultural values&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This represents a profound departure from an anthropocentric framing of the environment as a mere resource-giving vehicle for human exploitation towards viewing the environment in Kantian terms, as &#x0201c;an end in itself&#x0201d;, as a legal entity with rights of protection.</p><p>Eco-centric concepts now extend to &#x0201c;wild property law&#x0201d;, ascribing personhood to &#x0201c;Eco-entities&#x0201d; in law, and laws of &#x0201c;Ecocide&#x0201d;. The French government is the first country to pass a law of Ecocide (2020) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Despite some commentators saying this is a diluted form of the citizens&#x02019; convention recommendation, this is another indicator of the increasingly eco-centric orientation of recent legal developments. As legal developments are stimulated by this normative shift towards eco-centricity, a growing focus for public health stakeholders will pertain to the incorporation of a public health mandate into this new eco-centric legal paradigm. Will eco-centric laws be grounded in the One Health model [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] championed by environmental health practitioners and others? Will they respond to our need to reconcile goals of societal development, public health, and ecological preservation? It is these questions at the intersection of law and public health which will be important to address in future interdisciplinary collaborations.</p><p>Eco-centric laws have been passed in countries including: Ecuador in 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], Bolivia in 2010 and 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] (Law of the Rights of Mother Earth and Law of Mother Earth) and Panama in 2022. Panama grants nature the &#x0201c;right to exist, persist, and regenerate its life cycles&#x0201d;, defined as a &#x0201c;unique, indivisible and self-regulating community of living beings, elements and eco-systems interrelated to each other that sustains, contains and reproduces all beings&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Other eco-centric laws have been codified in Colombia, Mexico, Uganda, and are included in Chile&#x02019;s proposed constitution. In the United States, rights of nature have been shaped at the local level in more than 30 instances, including in the states of Pennsylvania, Florida, Minnesota and Colorado.</p><p>Giving rights to nature is a way to fulfill the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, as they are inter-dependent. Ultimately, both public health promotion and legal reform have common aims of creating a policy landscape conducive to human well-being. The integration of a public health mandate into a new eco-centric legal paradigm will optimize its potential to promote human well-being&#x02014;the core objective underpinning both international law and public health. By knowing to what degree public health has featured in the empirical arguments used to justify climate legal action to date, we can better understand how well existing eco-centric and other environmental health laws lend themselves to public health promotion. Should gaps be identified, we can begin to postulate how existing legal doctrines and practices can be enhanced to increase the credibility of public health arguments in climate legal action and by consequence, ensure legal rulings on climate litigation have positive implications for public health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Objectives</title><p>The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy examined in 2021 global trends in climate change litigation [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

We performed a search in these case documents to quantify the number of times that the word health was explicitly used in this litigation. We used the case data to identify climate litigation with a legal strategy, where the plaintiff relied on climate science and public health as part of a systematic challenge to a field of law. This resulted in 65 cases categorized as public health climate litigation, where public health was part of the litigation strategy.</p><p>The primary sources for this research have been the respective case law databases of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and the Sabin Center for Climate Change law [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Anthropocentric conceptualizations of the environment as a human-serving/resource-producing asset were also notably more apparent in the 1990&#x02013;99 cases.</p><p>In contrast, post-2000 cases featured far more explicit references to climate change. Not only were allegations grounded in an explicit focus on climate change, but many cases, particularly in more recent years linked human rights (including the right to health) with de-carbonization, sought increased liability for climate risk-associated financial/investment activity, as well as legal attribution of personhood for the environmental, or legal accountability to future generations impacted by climate change. Compatible with this finding is the temporal trend of increasing likelihood of case-driven policy change across time. Indeed, in keeping with accelerating climate change, most of the cases which directly led to the passage of new climate-friendly, environmental health-rooted, or human rights-oriented legislation or legal statutes occurred in the past 5 years.

The rising trend in cases filed (<xref rid="pone.0268633.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) indicates a growing expectation that actors ought to be held accountable for actions which wreak havoc on the environment and threaten the prospect of sustaining a climate compatible with human life. These temporal trends are generally consistent with findings from other studies which have documented a relatively consistent rise in both US- and non-US-filed climate litigation cases [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><p>The discourse on environmental health now occurring in legal courts can also be said to represent an increased appreciation for the role of Ecosystem Services in supporting health and well-being, not only in terms of material resources (&#x0201c;provisioning services&#x0201d;) but also sheltering populations from physical harm for example purifying water (&#x0201c;regulating services&#x0201d;), maintaining planetary equilibrium (&#x0201c;supporting services&#x0201d;), and promoting spiritual and cultural value (&#x0201c;culturally enriching services&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The post-2015 surge in cases has been linked with two major 2015 events: 1) the passage of the Paris Agreement which solidified national commitments to carbon emission reduction to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, providing more legal leverage for plaintiffs suing purely on the basis of GHG emission exceedances [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and 2) the landmark judgement delivered in the <italic toggle="yes">Urgenda</italic> case where a class-action brought by 886 Dutch citizens resulted in a court order for the Dutch government to adopt a more ambitious emission reduction target [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>The momentum created by the success of <italic toggle="yes">Urgenda</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 1) led to similar cases emerging in the domestic tribunals of several jurisdictions all over the world, ranging from Belgium to France and South Korea, beginning what has been referred to as the &#x0201c;new wave&#x0201d; of climate litigation [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>Despite the trend in plaintiffs using litigation as a legal tool for climate action, it remains unclear, from our results and other studies [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], to what extent climate litigation generates new government legislation or policy. This uncertainty is especially pronounced among LMICs, where the frequency of filed cases remains extremely low, representing only 2% (n = 35) of the 360 non-US cases. Notwithstanding the relatively high volume of litigation, North America (including Canada) has passed only 33 climate laws and policies, which is significantly less than the 677 passed in Europe and Central Asia. Whilst outside the scope of this study, analyzing the relationship between existing legal frameworks, breaches of these and numbers of cases brought before courts is an area worthy of further research.</p><p>The total rise in cases is due largely to the recently documented increases in annual litigation occurring in the US and in a select few other jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Spain, and the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, litigation may indicate that there are political, cultural or other obstacles to climate justice in a particular jurisdiction. In <italic toggle="yes">Juliana v United States</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 7), despite a 38-page submission by leading public health experts stating that &#x0201c;without significant intervention, this new era will come to define the health of an entire generation&#x0201d;, the court declined to directly adjudicate on climate change. The court explained the adjudication did not refute the science, rather recoiled from passing a political ruling in the following statement: &#x0201c;There is no justiciable &#x02018;controversy&#x02019; when parties seek adjudication of a political question&#x02026; It is not the province of the judiciary to make the policy decisions required to grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek. Nor may this Court direct other branches of government to overhaul their fossil fuel, agriculture, logging, and family planning policies to address climate change. To suggest otherwise is to overlook &#x02018;the separate and distinct constitutional role&#x02019; of the judiciary&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This ruling may yet be overturned on appeal, but the judges of this case interpreted the constitution so as to hold that climate policy must arise from the legislative and political process, and not the judiciary.</p><p>Scholars have highlighted that the role of the global South in climate litigation should not be overlooked. We find this contention meritorious because, despite the relatively low numbers of cases from LMICs, many, most notably in Colombia, Ecuador, Bangladesh and India, were eco-centric cases brought against powerful companies. The important context here is that the 52 LMICs produced a fraction of the total 2020 CO<sub>2</sub> emission [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], yet, they disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change impact and a higher risk of climate-driven health threats. Therefore, it is particularly salient for LMICs to use legal arguments based on climate injustice and vulnerability.</p><p>Finally, our finding that a growing number of cases are being brought by individuals (for instance as class-action lawsuits) provides further evidence of an increasingly &#x0201c;bottom-up approach to climate governance&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. From a pro-health standpoint, this can be viewed as an indication of rising public awareness of the threat of climate change and an accompanying realization by individuals and civil society of their democratic right to hold corporations and governments accountable for actions which infringe their rights to a healthy environment. Our analysis of litigation outcomes shows marked heterogeneity. Increased pressure on legislatures and corporations to change their behaviour is clearly evident, yet many courts remain slow to take the fullest action that the science calls for. Trends suggest this pressure is likely to increase this decade.</p><p>Still, early successes particularly in the field of human rights give reason for optimism; amassing a folio of successful litigation that translates to pro-health and pro-environment policy can be expected to motivate others to bring forward cases citing egregious occurrences or prospects of harm.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Temporal and geographic trends in legal argumentation</title><sec id="sec021"><title>Climate change as a peripheral vs. core issue</title><p>Climate Change Litigation (CCL) has gained prominence over the past three decades as a &#x0201c;governance mechanism for addressing climate change&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United States, climate legal action began as a means to hold actors accountable for activities knowingly contributing to GHG emissions exceeding national guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Our database searches identified that between 1986 and the end of May 2020, a total of 1,587 cases of CCL worldwide had been brought before courts, with 1,213 (76%) cases in the United States and 374 cases in 36 other countries and eight regional or international jurisdictions. Out of this total we found 65 directly linked public health cases. With the mounting climate crisis unfolding, CCL continues to be a growing field of law that intersects International and National Environmental Law, International Human Rights Law, and a complex range of statutes, regulations, and legal principals spanning national, subnational and, in some countries, constitutional law.</p><p>One of the most notable temporal trends we observed was the increasing frequency of climate change being framed as the core issue. Litigation is evidently evolving as a specific tool for climate legal action. Early cases tended to present environmental destruction as the central concern and framed climate change as a peripheral or secondary issue. The 2020 climate litigation snapshot found climate change to be &#x0201c;at the centre of the legal argument&#x0201d; in about 41% of cases, whereas in the remaining 59% climate change was classified as a &#x0201c;peripheral issue&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The increasing discussion of climate change as a core issue suggests the &#x02018;legal mainstreaming&#x02019; of climate change, whereby the adaptation, mitigation, and regulation of industry, becomes a matter of business and financial law, discussed in detail below.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>The changing role of environmental and human rights law in litigation</title><p>Our results confirm reported trends attesting to a substantive rise in the contributions of environmental and human rights law to legal argumentation in litigation.</p><p>Regarding human rights, several powerful case studies illustrate a trend towards petitioners increasingly employing rights claims in climate change lawsuits. In the <italic toggle="yes">Urgenda</italic> case (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 1), the courts decided that human rights, which include the &#x0201c;right to health&#x0201d; is linked with decarbonization. In a case brought by <italic toggle="yes">Friends of the Irish Environment</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], the courts held that Ireland&#x02019;s national mitigation plan partially violated statutory law, because it was not set to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently over the near term. In this case, human rights were used as part of the justification.</p><p>In the case of <italic toggle="yes">Maria Khan et al</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">v the Federation of Pakistan</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 3), rights to life, dignity, and a clean and healthy environment were argued to be under threat by the actions of the defendants. Likewise, the constitutionally guaranteed &#x0201c;Right to Life&#x0201d; is evoked in the legal argumentation of <italic toggle="yes">Future Generations v Ministry of the Environment</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 2), as is &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">Article 2(2) of the Basic Law</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Right to Life and Physical Integrity</italic>&#x0201d; in the lawsuit filed against <italic toggle="yes">District of Columbia vs</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Exxon Mobil Corp</italic>. (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 5). In their analysis of other rights-based claims in climate litigation cases, Peel and Osofsky (2017) conclude that receptivity of courts to rights-based framing is on the rise because it provides a &#x0201c;tangible legal framework for analyzing state actions that lead to climate change&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This is encouraging from a public health standpoint, as all UN human rights treaty bodies now recognize individual rights to life, health, food, and water [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268633.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], providing a stronger legal avenue for plaintiffs to link claims of health threats to rights-based legal frameworks.</p><p>Human rights have also been used by the defense in &#x02018;just transition litigation&#x02019; to question the &#x0201c;benefits and burdens of the transition away from fossil fuels and towards net-zero emissions&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Public health science can provide critical evidence to ensure that human rights are protected, defended and upheld. That defensive interests do not succeed in using a human rights narrative, when it is corporate rights that are at stake, and not human well-being.</p><p>In relation to rights for nature, we also observed a rise in eco-centric framings of the environmental. This included the attribution of personhood to nature in some of the more recent cases and the recognition of the inherent value of the environment independent of ecosystem services.</p><p>In the case of <italic toggle="yes">Future Generations v Ministry of the Environment</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 2), a group of youth plaintiffs in Colombia sued the government, municipalities and several corporations based on a &#x0201c;right to a healthy environment, life, health, food and water&#x0201d;. The court determined that the &#x0201c;fundamental rights to life and health are linked and determined by the environment and ecosystem&#x0201d;. The court further recognized the Colombian Amazon as subject to rights.</p><p>There are similar cases in India, Bangladesh, Colombia, Ecuador, and New Zealand.

Our study revealed that only 65 (3.96%) of the 1641 cases used a litigation strategy which included climate change at the center, with extensive use of the word &#x0201c;health&#x0201d; mentioned in the case file submitted to the court. We identified a rise in explicitly health-linked cases over recent years. This rise is consistent with the general increase in litigation cases and is not specific to litigation pursued on public health grounds.</p><p>In their study on the role of health in climate litigation, McCormick et al. (2018) found that the Clean Air Act (CAA) was used to support 32% of all cases in the US in which litigants relied on health concerns to support their claims [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Interviews with plaintiffs revealed that their primary incentive for pursuing cases under the CAA was that, unlike laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, the CAA has the protection of public health as its principle goal [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This shows that where health is the main focus of a given legal doctrine or environmental regulation, there exists a more direct and powerful avenue for individuals to pursue litigation on the basis of health concerns.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Receptivity of courts to public health-framed argumentation</title><p>Amongst the 65 directly health-linked cases, there were 11 wins, 11 losses and 43 remain undetermined. The low number of directly health-linked climate cases and the number where decisions are pending, precludes accurate assessment of trends in the receptivity of courts to public health-framed argumentation. The early successes, such as Urgenda Foundation v State of the Netherlands (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 1) and other cases are testament to the potential power of public health claims in legal argumentation, yet it remains premature to conclude whether or not public health arguments presented to courts will be seen with the credibility and weight that they warrant.</p><p>Nonetheless, one may postulate that as climate-health science matures, making clearer the links on which legal claims rest, the receptiveness of courts to public health language may rise. While McCormick et al. found that cases in which health was an issue had a win rate nearly the same as that for non-health cases (31% and 30%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], claims made by litigants attested to the perceived power of health risk attributions in legal argumentation. As stated, many litigants were &#x0201c;motivated to include health allegations in climate cases because they make the consequences of unabated climate change tangible and may increase the chances that courts will grant the relief sought by satisfying the substantive criteria needed to achieve success on the legal merits of the claim&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Additionally, McCormick et al. noted that several cases in the database that centered on claims about contaminated water and used health as a central argument were won by plaintiffs seeking improved protections for local communities [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p><p>We contend that health ought to have a bearing on court rulings given the inherent political salience it holds. In his review of fishery management law, Craig (2014) argues that when it comes to advocating for laws targeted at ocean-focused climate change adaptation, a public health connection can provide &#x0201c;a political saliency and importance that is often otherwise missing&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>].</p><p>Likewise, Nosek (2018) argues that, so long as health threats in litigation cases can be proven as imminent and knowingly created, debate should naturally &#x0201c;shift towards the necessity of intervention by government and industry officials&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Attribution and climate-health science</title><p>Litigation rests fundamentally upon the ability of the plaintiff to link the accused actions to evidence-backed consequences. Climate attribution science offers the ability to prove causation and is now viewed as a central ingredient for success. Contemporary use of extreme event modelling and the accessibility of this data to the court plays a large role in determining the &#x0201c;attributable risk&#x0201d; of scrutinized actions in climate litigation [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p><p>With climate-health science currently increasing in strength and credibility, data-backed argumentation offers powerful leverage in future health-centred climate litigation. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">Neubauer et al</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">v Germany</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 4), plaintiffs cite IPCC data showing the risk of death, injury, and damage to health in low-lying coastal areas vulnerable to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. Plaintiffs cited robust evidence of the link between rising allergies and lengthening pollen seasons, between respiratory diseases and both ragweed blooms and flood-induced indoor mould growth, and storm/flood disasters and psychological trauma. This is supported by the conclusion drawn by McCormick et al. (2018) that &#x0201c;the strength of the scientific evidence mustered to support litigants&#x02019; challenges is likely to be an important determinant of case outcomes&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].</p><p>Cases reviewed by McCormick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] revealed that climate science was only occasionally a central part of the court decisions. This indicates the existence of competing factors which weigh into the decision-making on legal outcomes. Thus, to strengthen the relative weight placed on scientific evidence in legal decision-making on climate litigation, an argument can be made that emphasis should be put on the most scientifically sound, and socially, politically, and economically salient points, backed by expert testimony and robustly generated syntheses of the literature. An additional requirement may be for evidence to show that health risks are imminent, since it has been shown that the narrative of climate risks being distant in space and time dilutes the urgency to act now or the credibility of climate risk allegations [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].</p><p>With regards to leveraging the insights, research, and testimony of public health experts in climate litigation, it is worth noting the possibility of COVID-19 having opened a policy window for such action. Undoubtedly, COVID-19 has raised the profile of public health expertise and the value of epidemiology. Thus, public health expertise may be accorded rightful recognition in courts of law in a post-COVID-19 era, something which can and should be exploited in upcoming climate litigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Economic incentives as a barrier to or incentive for public health</title><sec id="sec029"><title>Financial liability and public health</title><p>The case law brings forward economic and financial considerations, presenting as either incentives or barriers to &#x02018;adaptation and mitigation&#x02019;, accompanied by liability for market actors.

Shell is the parent company of many subsidiaries and has a principal place of business in the Hague, Netherlands. According to the summons, &#x0201c;the financial incentive for Shell to continue its fossil business model developed since 1890 is enormous, which is why it hampers the energy transition, and every year continues to invest dozens of billions to secure the future of the fossil industry for much of this century&#x0201d;.

However, this does not absolve RDS of its individual partial responsibility to do its part regarding the emissions of the Shell group, which it can control and influence&#x0201d;.</p><p>The centrality of financial capital in global economies embeds financial institutions within the broader climate law and mitigation landscape. Financial investment is a powerful influencer on industrial and economic activities serving as an enabler, through incentives, or as a barrier. These organizations offer another avenue for communities to ensure their sentiments are reflected. With regards to financial institutions, several cases illustrate this indicator of financial liability in climate change lawsuits, in which the strategy of litigation has been referred to as &#x0201c;investor activism&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].</p><p>In <italic toggle="yes">McVeigh v Rest</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], the respondent sought information from his investment fund, about any actions the respondent was taking, regarding the financial risk posed to his investment by climate change.

Considering the shifting values as citizens on all continents witness climate catastrophes, and the emergence of global youth movements, consumer and social preferences are changing in favor of the environment, health, and well-being.

Prior to this case, the IFC held immunity from such prosecutions, in the same manner enjoyed by foreign governments.

In the 65 public health cases included, there is an expectation from plaintiffs that government and economic actors will prioritize human health and planetary survival over economic profit. In the case of Youth Verdict v Waratah Coal, youth argue that the government has a duty of care to protect the health of its citizens. Further, in the 2020 ruling on modification to ethanol [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], the Mexican Supreme court decided an agency was restricted from raising the ethanol content in fuel, as the &#x02018;right to a healthy environment&#x02019; must be prioritized over economic profit. Research has shown that &#x0201c;carbon-only&#x0201d; approaches to mitigating climate change that do not explicitly integrate air and water pollution and environmental justice considerations could fail to alleviate the public health harms and disproportionate burdens of fossil fuel production and use or even exacerbate them [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Considering that in response to the Covid-19 crisis, many (though not all) governments acted forcefully to prevent a public health emergency, including by deprioritizing the economy, it is likely that the expectation of prioritizing planetary health will only rise. With global fiscal support for the pandemic already amounting to a sheer $9 trillion by April 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>], the Covid-19 crisis also further demonstrated the financial capacity for large-scale investment when imminent threats arise. At a minimum, to prevent a climate-health crisis, there is an expectation for the risk to be fully priced into the financial markets. Yet, eco-centric laws can go further.

While nine translated climate laws and policies are reported from China, including the &#x0201c;National Plan for Tackling Climate Change 2014&#x02013;2020&#x0201d;, no case litigation is reported, even though there is indication such cases have taken place in China. Similarly, three climate laws and policies are reported from Saudi Arabia including the &#x0201c;Saudi Arabia Vision 2030&#x0201d; and 26 from Vietnam, yet no cases are reported for either country.</p><p>Aside from the countries and regions for which case laws have not been included, there may also have been criminal and penal charges (i.e. criminal litigation) not captured given the Western-centric focus on civil litigation within these databases. The sources used are also both English language databases, respectively from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Common Law system underpinning the reported cases also has roots in the British Empire [<xref rid="pone.0268633.ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], introducing an inevitable bias in the legal scope of cases captured in this review.</p><p>Finally, we recognize that our &#x0201c;case definition&#x0201d; of public health-linked cases may be too narrow to capture all those cases which truly express a concern for human health as one of the many issues at stake in climate litigation. Indeed, we observed a far greater number of cases which alluded to aspects of public health under threat without explicitly using the word &#x0201c;health&#x0201d;. The relative importance of these cases should not be overlooked, for they undoubtedly represent a shifting mindset towards climate change, with the perceived threats to human health taking a more central role.</p><p>Climate Litigation is restricted by barriers preventing access to justice, including access to legal knowledge. We did not use subscription case law sources, including Westlaw, Thompson Reuters, and Lexis Nexus, RELX, as these databases are not open access and a costly subscription can limit access for prospective climate litigants especially in low-income countries. Perhaps, restricted access to legal sources exacerbates the problem of climate injustice, as it is a reality that those disproportionately impacted by climate change have least access to justice.</p><p>We have not examined questions of jurisprudence, which extend into theoretical questions such as what is law?

The field is undergoing a rapid transition.</p><p>Yet reticence persists. Defence teams can no longer argue against the validity of the science, or ignorance of the link between anthropogenic climate disruption and human health harm. In the context of climate health emergency, it is evident that amplification of decarbonisation efforts is urgently required. Litigation offers a powerful tool to drive multi- sector transition. Given the shortcomings that remain in the widespread use and acceptance of public health claims in legal argumentation used for litigation, we advise that laws and legal incentives are created, which position public health as a central focus. In the interests of future generations, we argue for more funding to be mobilized towards climate-health evidence and further develop this research as a scientific discipline, the promotion of greater public and industry awareness of climate-health links to support more widespread utilization of public health claims in allegations of wrongdoing, and that a legal panel of climate-health experts be devised which can be called upon by plaintiffs to provide expert testimony and deliver credible yet compelling research briefings during court hearings.</p><p>We advocate for the establishment of multi-lateral body, with legally binding power, to access breaches of existing law, identify laws that amplify disproportionate health impacts upon specific communities, responds to systemic racism, corruption, and inequities within legal systems, is aligned with the Hague to bring criminal charges against nations and corporations, and works to develop real legal incentives to ensure planetary and human safety.</p><p>Considering the impacts of climate change, we must ensure that health risks are fully integrated into the economic cost should companies seek to avoid liability for climate risks. Should this recommendation be adopted, we are confident we will see further developments in the field of litigation where public health arguments play a key role in mobilizing legislative action. As the risk of harm to public health is integrated into the economy, through legal liability, this can incentivize a well-being/health-based economy. This will be a win for not only the plaintiffs pursuing litigation, but also for the whole of humanity whose health and future survival is under dire threat by the climate crisis.</p></sec><sec id="sec035" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0268633.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0268633.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the World Federation of Public Health Associations Environmental Health Working Group for supporting this research through the provision of expert guidance in the development and finalization of this report.
