In Guinea-Bissau, farmers traditionally used no external inputs, as the regular tidal flooding of the lower fields with brackish water during the dry season, plowing, and free-roaming cattle grazing on the rice stubble helped fertilize the fields and control weeds. Smallholders had their own traditional techniques of pest control and introduced, selected, and multiplied their own rice seeds (Temudo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). However, the practice of letting the brackish water enter the rice fields is no longer used due to the frequent delayed onset, recurrent dry spells, and shorter duration of the rainy season. This has resulted in reduced fertility and increasing toxicity of the acid-sulfated soils developed under aerobic soil conditions (Cormier-Salem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Ritzema et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1996</xref>). Climate change has come with an increase in pest attacks according to many farmers who, in some villages, are using non-specific pesticides provided by traders.</p>
