A different picture emerges if there are tragic choices (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 136; Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 415). Such conflicts require paying heed to the tragic question of whose capabilities will be sacrificed (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 136). To Nussbaum, such conflicts are &#8216;a sign that society has probably gone wrong somewhere; that it is probably not well designed&#8217; (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 401). Furthermore, they &#8216;initiate long-term planning efforts that will allocate resources away from supporting entitlements that are not fundamental and toward supporting threshold level of capabilities that define the conditions of justice&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 415).</p>
