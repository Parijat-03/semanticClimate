<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Additionally, we also considered some other potential factors (16 variables) that might impact human mobility to parks, including the land cover types, climatic conditions, population, and park types and numbers (see all of them in Table&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the land cover variables, we reclassified the 2016 map of USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) into the following five classes to account for the major land cover types in the study area: forest (original class # 41&#8211;43), agricultural (original class #81, 82), grass (original class #51, 52, 71&#8211;74), urban and barren land (original class #21&#8211;24, 31), and water (original class #11, 12). We incorporated two variables to estimate the effects of park sizes and recreation levels on the mobility patterns (Powers et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xiao, Lee, &amp; Larson,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), including a vector representing the number of state parks (State Parks) in each county and a dummy variable indicating the presence of national parks (National Park). Climatic measurements accessed from &#8220;climateR&#8221; R&#8208;package were included to consider the influence of weather and climate on recreation and park visitation, as well as the potential seasonality in human mobility (Smith,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). All the variables were aggregated to the county level in each month of June&#8211;September.</p>
