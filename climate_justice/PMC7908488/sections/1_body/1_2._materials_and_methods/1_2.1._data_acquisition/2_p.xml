For the first, we chose Landsat scenes coinciding with extreme heat events for each of the 20 metropolitan regions. This was done by selecting the warmest day available between 2013 and 2019 that coincided with a cloud-free day of Landsat 8 OLI imagery capture. For the second scenario, we collected scenes for an average summer day based on the average of available Landsat scenes during the study period. The dual-level analysis allows for comparison of the urban heat island patterns during extreme heat events as well as during conditions close to the median daytime temperature value for the summer season. For the third scenario, we used nighttime thermal imagery for an average summer temperature night close to the median nighttime temperature value for summer imagery available.</p>
