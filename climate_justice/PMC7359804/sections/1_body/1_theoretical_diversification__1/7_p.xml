<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0085">This last statement segues into a broader point made by researchers from different hues: a focus on (re)distribution &#8211; equity, or how benefits and disadvantages work out socially and/or spatially &#8211; is unduly limiting and risks disguising the processes through which certain outcomes are generated, or potentials are marshalled into actualities. Both transport and mobilities researchers have argued that attention needs to be paid to broader power configurations, which is itself a term that is conceptualised in multiple ways. One way to do so is to focus attention on procedure and recognition (see below), which shifts attention towards society-centric understandings of transport justice. Yet, also among such understandings and in critical mobilities studies, a focus on (re)distribution is common. This is, for instance, the case in most research that uses the concepts of motility and capability to analyse questions of justice in relation to mobility (see <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Butz, 2015</xref> for a closely related argument).</p>
