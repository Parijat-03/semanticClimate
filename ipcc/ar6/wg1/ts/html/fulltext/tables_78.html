Assessments made on different time scales or\nmore local spatial scales might differ from what is shown in the figure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on observed changes.\nStriped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when\nthere is limited data and/or literature that prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least medium confidence in the observed change.\nThe confidence level for the human influence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution and event attribution literature,</td>
