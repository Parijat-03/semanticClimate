<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This research shows that when the mental health and wellbeing of children and youth is considered, from their sense of distress about an unknown future through to developing strategies for adapting to, and coping with, a chaotic climactic future, communities are given guidance on how to build whole and healthy futures. This paper has explored factors such as engaging children/youth as partners, researchers, and knowledge producers at a time when they are calling for the adult world to take urgent action to ensure that they will grow up and learn how to sustainably steward life on a healthy planet. This paper has also acknowledged that children/youth are experts in their own lives, and if included in the means of knowledge production, community-based decision making, policy development, and program delivery they will offer fresh perspectives to old challenges and learn to be change makers in their own right. The hope is that this work will foster a deepening understanding around children and youth&#8217;s responses to climate change and stave off despair through facilitating active efforts to build transformative responses to climate change. Through this integrated approach, taking action on climate change can not only improve children/youth&#8217;s health and wellbeing but also help to build and sustain healthy communities. As such, considering the Social and Ecological Determinants of Health when looking at both how climate change is impacting children and youth&#8217;s mental health and how to better support youth and children in the future are complementary practices.</p>
