Helm (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) addressed the impacts of the pandemic virus and suggested an agenda for research. The agenda included five sets of questions: examining the short&#8208;term impacts on emissions, the natural environment, and the need to address environmental policies; the importance of the 26th&#160;UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26); long term consequences of the financial impact of climate change and COVID&#8208;19; investment in green opportunities and legislation; deglobalization related to climate change and pandemics; debt and burden of pollution on future generations; and positive and negative behavioral changes related to the pandemic and climate change (Helm, <xref rid="phn12866-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
