Instead, we in the health professions&#8212;whether in public health or health care providers&#8212;must also pay attention to and take action regarding another body of evidence little discussed in the public health or medical literature: the critical research documenting how the public&#8217;s will is being subverted&#8212;and people and planetary health are being harmed&#8212;via changes to the &#8216;rules of the game&#8217; that affect democratic governance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

To strengthen the political impact of evidence on the health impacts of the climate crisis, it is essential to develop an informed and cohesive approach to addressing the conjoined political and biophysical threats to the people&#8217;s health and planetary health that is as every bit as integrated as how our bodies, like the bodies of all living organisms, daily embody the societal and ecological conditions in which we live [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
