and transgressive vocation? Or, in other words: How do participants learn to become
agents of change for a socially just habitat? To respond to these questions, in June
2019, the two first-named authors of this paper (one of whom became president of HIC
in 2020), embarked on an in-depth pedagogic exploration of the schools under the
HIC-AL umbrella as part of the capacity-building and action research programme,
Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality (KNOW). The research initially involved 21
extensive conversations with 14 HIC-AL members and affiliates, online and in person
in Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Cuba and Mexico.<sup>(<xref rid="fn5-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">5</xref>)</sup> As the COVID-19 pandemic brought
the possibility of further face-to-face encounters to a halt, we shifted to a
multimodal way of working, which included a process of self-documentation and
analysis by schools interested in this reflexive<sup>(<xref rid="fn6-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">6</xref>)</sup> exercise and collective online
workshops devoted to identifying the core &#8220;pedagogic narrative&#8221; underpinning each
school, as well as their common practices (see <xref rid="fig1-09562478221115334" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
