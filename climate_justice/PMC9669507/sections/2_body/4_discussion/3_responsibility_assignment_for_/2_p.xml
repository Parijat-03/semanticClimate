<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The notion of responsibility assignment also raises the broader question about
the function of predictive journalism in society, especially with respect to
mobilizing the public toward social issues or in crises when there is very
little known about the future. Prior research by <xref rid="bibr45-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Yanovitzky and Weber (2019)</xref> theorized
the effects of news media on policy actors and subsequently on policy making
where they outlined mobilization as one of the core knowledge-brokering
functions of news media. <xref rid="bibr1-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Appelgren and J&#246;nsson (2021)</xref> also found that the merger between
science communication and data journalistic practices coupled with motivational
framing were effective in increasing public engagement with climate change.
Accordingly, it is vital to deeply understand why and how the framing of
forecasts outlined in predictive journalism articles may encourage the public to
conduct a responsibility analysis of who is responsible for what, who needs to
do what, and when. Future work on predictive journalism should consider focusing
on understanding how the design and presentation of predictions could positively
shape and channel collective activities to increase citizen engagement and
willingness to take action on issues related to social and climate justice.</p>
