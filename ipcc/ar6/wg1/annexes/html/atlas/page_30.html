However, there are growing efforts to boost African climate science 10 by running and evaluating climate models over Africa (Endris et al., 2013; Kalognomou et al., 2013; 11 Gbobaniyi et al., 2014; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Klutse et al., 2016; Gibba et al., 2019).  12 13 CORDEX models simulate the occurrence of the West African Monsoon jump and the timing and amplitude 14 of mean annual cycle of precipitation and temperature over the homogeneous subregions of West Africa 15 (Gbobaniyi et al., 2014). CORDEX RCMs simulate eastern Africa rainfall adequately (Endris et al., 2013). 16 Over Southern Africa, CORDEX models capture the observed climatological spatial patterns of extreme 17 precipitation (Pinto et al., 2016). They simulate also the phasing and amplitude of monthly rainfall evolution 18 and the spatial progression of the wet season onset well over Southern Africa (Shongwe et al., 2015). The 19 southern African rainfall trend is found to have a significant downtrend of -0.013 mm/day per year and -20 0.003 mm/day per year for longer periods over the 20th century from 1900 to 2010 (Jury, 2013). However, 21 discrepancies and biases in present-day rainfall are reported over Uganda from the RCM-simulated rainfall 22 compared to three gridded observational datasets (Kisembe et al., 2018). Specifically, they reported that the 23 CORDEX models underestimate annual rainfall of Uganda and struggle to reproduce the variability of the 24 long and short rains seasons.  25 26 The CMIP project has not resulted in improved performance for Africa (Flato et al., 2013b; Rowell, 2013; 27 Whittleston et al., 2017) and culling ensembles based on existing metrics for Africa fails to reduce the range 28 of uncertainty in precipitation projections (Roehrig et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015; Rowell et al., 2016) but 29 CMIP6 presents less bias compared to CMIP5 over Africa (Adamu et al., submitted). Nonetheless, CMIP5 30 has been evaluated over Africa to advance the understanding of climate science (Biasutti, 2013; Rowell, 31 2013; Dike et al., 2015; McSweeney and Jones, 2016; Onyutha et al., 2016; Wainwright et al., 2019) and 32 recently, CMIP6 (Adamu et al., submitted; Almazroui et al., submitted, b).  33 34 35 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 329.03; y1: 340.01; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="329.03" x1="291.56">Atlas.5.2.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="329.03" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 329.03; y1: 340.01; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">36 37 Research over Africa (Druyan and Fulakeza, 2013; Hern&#225;ndez-D&#237;az et al., 2013; Panitz et al., 2014; Sarr et 38 al., 2015; Careto et al., 2018; Sylla et al., 2018) has improved since AR5 and even though the SR1.5 has 39 synthesised new information for the continent, there is still not enough information on specific areas for 40 assessment. A large ensemble of CORDEX Africa simulations have been used to present the impact of 1.5&#176;C 41 and 2&#176;C global warming levels (GWLs) (Klutse et al., 2018; Lennard et al., 2018; Maure et al., 2018; Mba et 42 al., 2018; Nikulin et al., 2018b; Osima et al., 2018). While a few studies addressed the whole African 43 continent (Lennard et al., 2018; Nikulin et al., 2018a), some focused on specific regions of Africa (Diedhiou 44 et al., 2018; Klutse et al., 2018; Kumi and Abiodun, 2018; Maure et al., 2018; Mba et al., 2018). CORDEX 45 simulations give a robust warming over Africa to exceed the mean global warming (Lennard et al., 2018; 46 Nikulin et al., 2018a). The rate of increase in minimum temperatures will exceed that of maximum 47 temperatures (Vizy and Cook, 2012). Over North Africa, summer mean temperatures from CORDEX, 48 CMIP5 (RCP8.5) and CMIP6 (SSP5-8.5) are projected to increase beyond 6.0&#176;C by the end of the century 49 with respect to the period 1970&#8211;2000 (Schilling et al., 2012; Ozturk et al., 2018; Almazroui et al., submitted, 50 b). Over West Africa, a continuous stronger warming is projected to occur 1 to 2 decades earlier than the 51 global average (IPCC, 2013; Mora et al., 2013; Sylla et al., 2016; Klutse et al., 2018) by 2100. The Sahel and 52 tropical West Africa are hotspots of climate change for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways from CMIP5 53 (Diffenbaugh and Giorgi, 2012). Temperature increases projected under RCP8.5 over Sudan and northern 54 Ethiopia implying that the Greater Horn of Africa would warm faster than the global mean relative to 55 </span></div></body></html>
