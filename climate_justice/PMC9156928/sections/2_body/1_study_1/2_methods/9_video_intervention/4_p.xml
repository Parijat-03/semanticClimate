<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">During the intervention period, participants received two Qualtrics surveys per week for six weeks. Each Qualtrics survey began with a 20-minute video that they were required to watch from beginning to end (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). They were asked to avoid distractions and to put away their devices. The video software dictated the pace of viewing (i.e. they could not advance beyond the video without the total time of the video having passed). After the video, the participants were then prompted to read a &#8216;climate events bulletin&#8217; which was identical to the climate event bulletins they received during the baseline period, but with new events (<xref rid="RSOS210006F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). Again, at the top of the bulletin, participants were reminded that they were not penalized for not attending these events. They were then asked seven attention-check questions, five covering the video and two covering the event bulletin. Responding incorrectly to three or more questions resulted in a $3 penalty for that overall video session ($3 were subtracted from the final payment of $100), and the participants were redirected to watch the video again and to re-take the final test to avoid losing the $3 (they only had two attempts).</p>
