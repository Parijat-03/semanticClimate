The last thing overburdened Extension agents need is another set of obligatory programs. They should instead bubble up from a dynamic conversation in which Extension agents from across 1862, 1890, and 1994 land grants and community partners propose pilot programs to scale up or new initiatives they could implement with expanded budgets and additional personnel. Extension leadership teams should champion new orientations internally and with federal, state, and local officials, university administrations and faculty, community partners, and the public, and take responsibility for making difficult decisions regarding partners, direction, and hiring to promote diversity and reflect new priorities. Some tradeoffs are inevitable and salutary. Moreover, it is incumbent on university administrators to recruit a diverse Extension leadership capable of championing and implementing this vision.</p>
