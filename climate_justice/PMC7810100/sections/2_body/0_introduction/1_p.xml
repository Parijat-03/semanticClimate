While union security has not been completely abolished, the campaign to eliminate it succeeded in one of its major goals in 2018. The Supreme Court in <italic>Janus v. AFSCME</italic>, reversing over 40&#160;years of precedent, outlawed union security in the public sector (<italic>Janus</italic>

As a result, unions representing government employees must now provide representation to all employees in the bargaining unit but cannot compel payment for that representation from any employee that chooses not to support the union financially. In this article, I look at what has happened to labor relations, unions, and the law since <italic>Janus.</italic> While it is early to assess the full impact of the decision, both unions and the forces opposed to them anticipated the decision and began taking steps to prepare well before the decision came down.</p>
