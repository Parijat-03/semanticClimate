      <td>Most households in the city have access to a\nmetered electricity connection, which reduces\nthe risks of illegal connections, and ensures\nconnectivity when the grid is restored after\ndisasters. Hence, the lack of power/electricity is\nnot a source of vulnerability for most households\nin Mumbai.</td>

(This analysis takes\ninto consideration the completion of the Metro\nnetwork, planned for the next decade).\nDuring flood events, waterlogged streets hinder\nphysical access to mass transit stations,\ndisrupting regular access to mobility networks.\nDuring a flooding event, the population\nhaving access to a mass transit station within\n1km potentially declines to 36.6%, as compared\nwith 60.5% on normal days.\nThe populations that are dependent on mass\ntransit to access jobs and for personal needs are\ndeeply impacted due to loss of working hours,\nreduced productivity, loss of income and the\ninability to access basic needs or access health\nand emergency services.\nThe vulnerability of poor households is\nexacerbated during such events.</td>
