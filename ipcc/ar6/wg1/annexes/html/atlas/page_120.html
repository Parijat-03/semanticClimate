The 4 information can be aggregated from solicited expert judgments on the likelihood or potential impacts of such 5 a rare event, triggered by its past occurrence or by evidence derived from analyses of model projections. For 6 instance, Dessai et al. (2018) use expert elicitation to characterise narratives of changes in the Indian 7 monsoon. Bamber et al. (2019) concluded that since AR5 uncertainty about sea level rise projections has 8 increased, based on expert opinions on the likelihood of an increased contribution from an unstable Antarctic 9 ice mass.  10 11 The scientific credibility (and uptake) of this climate information is sensitive to the reputation and track 12 record of the experts involved (National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2017). In addition the 13 protocol used to collect and aggregate the expert information is sensitive to biases, when interaction between 14 experts allows mutual influence between the experts&#8217; opinions. 15 16 17 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 64.02; y0: 556.67; y1: 567.65; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDKO+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="556.67" x1="388.64">Atlas.6.2 Communicating uncertainty: the role of language and visuals </span><span x0="27.66" y0="556.67" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.14; y0: 556.67; y1: 567.65; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18 19 The communication of uncertainty has a profound influence on the perception of information that is 20 exchanged during the communication process. In climate science, uncertainty refers to the inherent inability 21 to quantify the past, current or expected state of (components of) the climate system (Ho and Budescu, 22 2019). It is usually expressed by displaying information with an associated likelihood range, generated by 23 the use of ensembles of datasets or model projections (Slingo and Palmer, 2011). Major sources of 24 uncertainty in (IPCC) climate change assessments include imperfection of observational records, model 25 formulation, natural variability and socio-economic pathways.  26 27 Uncertainty in climate science communication can lead different audiences to interpret the information in 28 different ways (Corner et al., 2012). Audiences who do not understand that science is a debate and an 29 ongoing process of reducing uncertainty are more likely to dismiss scientific messages that highlight 30 uncertainty in the findings (Rabinovich and Morton, 2012). Leading with what is known, rather than what is 31 uncertain, leads to improved engagement with climate science messages (Trenberth, 2012). Some research 32 has recommended reframing uncertainty information using the closely related concept of &#8216;risk&#8217;, with which 33 as the language of the insurance, health and national security sectors, most people are more familiar (Howe 34 et al., 2019). It is also argued that scientists must realize that their engagement in advocacy does not 35 necessarily hurt their credibility (Kotcher et al., 2017). 36 37 A narrative structure can simplify otherwise complex issues and help audiences make decisions in the face of 38 this complexity (Mohan and Topp, 2018). Understanding and engagement with narratives can be made more 39 effective if the scientific information is presented in a narrative format congruent with the audiences&#8217; values, 40 rather than presented as a list of facts (Jones and Song, 2014; Nisbet and Markowitz, 2016; Harris, 2017). On 41 the other hand, many studies suggest that the framing of information is crucial to the way in which it is 42 disseminated or discussed (Lakoff, 2010; Berkhout et al., 2013; Kause et al., 2019). 43 44 The visual communication of climate science can take many forms, including graphs, infographics, 45 animations and photographs. The emergence of social media has emphasised the role of visuals, illustrated 46 by the rapid dissemination and uptake of for example the &#8216;warming stripes&#8217; (Royal Meteorological Society, 47 2019) and also used in the Interactive Atlas (Figure Atlas.51:). Studies have used interviews and online 48 surveys to assess interpretations of visualizations used to communicate climate uncertainties to decision 49 makers (Daron et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2015; McMahon et al., 2015; Retchless and Brewer, 2016). They 50 commonly find wide-ranging interpretations of the same information and distorted understanding that can be 51 caused by seemingly arbitrary visualization choices. Taylor et al. (2015) found that preferences for a 52 particular visualization approach does not always align with the approaches that achieve greatest accuracy in 53 interpretation. 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
