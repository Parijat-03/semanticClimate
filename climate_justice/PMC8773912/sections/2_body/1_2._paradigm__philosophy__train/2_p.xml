As all healthcare providers are, NDs are guided by the fundamental principle of nonmaleficence; five additional principles inform naturopathic care and decision-making, all of which are emphasized throughout training [<xref rid="B10-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Therapeutic Order was designed as a framework for holistic care to which these principles are applied (<xref rid="children-09-00008-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While a critical part of an ND&#8217;s role is identifying when more forceful methods and/or referral may be necessary, the principles of the profession remind clinicians to approach families and children holistically, individually, and with the least force possible in order to achieve the therapeutic goal. </p>
