On average across all census tracts examined, there is a greater than 1.25 K&#8211;2.0 K difference between them (cf: <xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These observations add further support to Hsu et al. demonstrating that historically marginalized groups are exposed to higher SUHI intensities, in the present case approaching &gt;2 K in some cases on average [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, Hsu finds that Black communities on average have the highest degree of inequitable thermal exposure followed by Hispanic ones. The findings presented before fitting the models, which are the raw observations of average temperature across all prevalent tracts, where population density, K&#246;ppen&#8211;Geiger climate zone, temporal and spatial effects are not yet accounted for, show Hispanics on average to have the highest thermal exposure followed by Black and Asian, with White community exposure negligible by comparison. Furthermore, Hsu et al. use a weighted average of the SUHI intensity for each tract based on the number of individuals in each demographic group. The methodological differences between using a weighted average and prevalence could explain some of the differing observations.</p>
