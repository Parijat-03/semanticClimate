The Australian economy performed well during the past three decades; therefore, the real income effect was the dominating factor in Australia&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emission changes. Australia&#8217;s economic growth continued even during the Asian crisis (in late 1990s) and 2008&#8211;2009 financial crises. Therefore, the real income effect continued to increase the country&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As highlighted in the empirical findings section, the energy intensity factor offset the increasing impact of real income on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Further achievements are possible if the energy intensity of each economic sector could be further reduced. Thus, a sector level evaluation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Australia became essential for the identification of highly energy intensive and CO<sub>2</sub> intensive sectors. In Australia, electricity and heat production were the sectors that emitted the highest amount of emissions during the studied period. Between 1990 and 2017, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from electricity and heat production activities rose from 129 to 191 MT in Australia (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Since the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions predominantly result from the combustion of fuel for electricity and heat production in Australia, the reduction of those emissions will not hamper the economic growth of the country. Australia&#8217;s economy relies more on the service sector. In 2017, as indicated by World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>) data, the services sector comprised 67% of the total economy.</p>
