All the LDPCs have urged financial assistance, mainly from the international community (N1.3). They have conditioned most of their NDC targets with international financial support. They need it for the capacity building of different sectors (N5.3) and preventive measures (N7.2) against climate change risks. They wish to have very &#8220;timely&#8221; (Solomon Island, p. 20) and &#8220;direct access&#8221; to these funds under the &#8220;readiness&#8221; program of the Green Climate Fund without any intermediary agencies (Kiribati, pp. 24&#8211;25). They need climate finance in the form of &#8220;aid,&#8221; &#8220;concessions&#8221; (Sao TEP, p. 3), or &#8220;grants&#8221; (Chad, p. 11) as they contribute a very small proportion of GHG emissions yet are highly vulnerable to climate risks. Gambia (p. 28) urges adjustment in the support architecture by giving priority to the programs that generate strong domestic efforts, such as climate finance.</p>
