<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0065">It appears that the developing world is likely to not only suffer from more climate change impacts (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Schlosberg, 2019</xref>), but also regulation that disproportionately targets their specific behaviors (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Gach, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Osborne, 2015</xref>). From a climate justice perspective, we must ask if emitters with less relative power and voice in government procedure, as well as at the international level climate negotiations, face unfair regulation. Specifically, why does the global north, with whiter emitters, face only behavior change or voluntary approaches while developing countries face top-down approaches? New lines of research must begin to consider this conflation of sector vs individual emissions, to more thoroughly explore the psychological externalizations of behavior that lead to the belief that air travel is a human right, while interrogating the justice implications facing forest users in developing countries. Meanwhile, it is time to make offset payments mandatory for all airline tickets&#8211;as the purchasers are some of the largest individual contributors to climate change&#8211;so that the loggers in developing countries receive a payment for their lower emissions lifestyle. As the airline industry adapts to the pandemic and plots a course for recovery, now might be an opportune moment to include a more sustainable agenda moving forward.</p>
