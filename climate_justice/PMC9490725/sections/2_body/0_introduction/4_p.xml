A body of work has looked specifically at the ethics of emission trading (e.g. Aldred, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>; Dirix et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; O&#8217;Neill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2007</xref>), but with few empirical applications to specific sectors. The market ethics literature will fill the gap in the business ethics literature regarding the depoliticisation of direct regulation by helping to elucidate how the dominance of market thinking has allowed policymakers to avoid difficult political decisions around environmental protection.</p>
