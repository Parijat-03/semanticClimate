Our findings are able to integrate relevant qualitative and quantitative research. Our research shows which aspects of existing theories were also reflected in our data and in which respects existing approaches should possibly be extended. Our methodological approach has helped to identify individual and group-related motives, emotions, and intentions to act that would not have been taken into account in purely theory-based quantitative studies. The psychological determinants of engagement in collective action identified here can be taken up and empirically investigated in further qualitative and quantitative studies. This in turn can and should lead to meaningful modifications of relevant theories and models of collective action.</p>
