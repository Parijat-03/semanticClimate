Yet, its broadness raises questions about practical implementation. <italic>How, for instance, might empirical research projects by students, early career researchers and faculty members contribute to the agenda Sheller has proposed? What does it mean to engage in planning from a mobility justice perspective? Which principles, methodologies, tools and approaches for research and planning are suggested?</italic>

<italic>Mobilities, Mobility Justice and Social Justice</italic> offers useful pointers for the realm of research, but other directions and approaches can easily be imagined and more work with a focus on planning is required. This is why the papers in the VSI engage with all three of the questions.</p>
