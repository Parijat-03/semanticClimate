An asymmetry in contribution results from disproportionate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across countries. For example, in 2016, the average US citizen emitted about 16 tons of carbon/day while the average Congolese emitted less than 0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The asymmetry in the power to decide, is often exemplified by the underrepresentation of some countries during climate negotiations; for example, at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP) in 2007, Germany was represented by 101 delegates while Ethiopia&#8217;s interests were covered by only 2 delegates, despite similar populations. An asymmetry in impact is observed in the disproportionate impacts of climate change across countries, the highest impacts often felt by those contributing the least to GHG emissions.</p>
