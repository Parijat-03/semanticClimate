As on today the silt is either dumped in local depressions along drains or disposed of in sanitary landfill sites managed by respective Municipal Corporations, it is an old age method and with the passage of time all the sanitary land fill sites have already been saturated and no more scope for further disposal left. To redress this serious problem, department of Environment, Govt. of Delhi has engaged Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee for exploring and suggesting recycling option for this type of waste into useful product with or without suitable additions based upon the physical and technical characteristics of silt. The solution resulting from the study would prove techno-commercial viability of the product. I&amp;FC Department is in liaisoning with CBRI and the inputs whatever required shall be provided to them. This technology is in initial stage and the implementation/adoption shall be based on results of the study. An innovative projects have been conceptualized for development of Rajokari Water body adopting wet land system based on SWAB technology, however the project could be taken up after NGT clearance regarding use of construction material. The landscape of water bodies is proposed so as to ensure its maximum utility for the public benefit.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.2" top="250.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="250.27" x1="508.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 250.27; y1: 262.27; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Similarly at two different location of old abandoned Bawana Escape drain for treating waste water of drain No. 6 &amp; PWD drain discharge into the abandoned portion of Bawana Escape Drain and thereafter treated water shall be utilized for increasing water table of the area through ground water recharge. </span></div></body></html>
