(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>), it can be said that the EU27 Mediterranean country group has reached a stage of decoupling between economic growth and emissions. On the other hand, as a whole, the non-EU27 country group is still in an industrialization stage in which, historically, development goes hand in hand with an increase in emissions. Consequently, it is foreseeable that the group of non-EU27 countries will need to use the atmospheric space that the MCJ grants them. This space should be dedicated to achieving a decent standard of living for their population, in other words, dedicated to the development agenda: housing, food, health care, water supply and sanitation, electricity, transport, communications, climate change adaptation, etc. (Rao and Baer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>).</p>
