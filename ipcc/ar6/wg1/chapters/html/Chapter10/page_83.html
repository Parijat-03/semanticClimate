Changing forest cover to agricultural land in an RCM (Paul et&#160;al., 2016) finds weakened summer monsoon rainfall especially in central and eastern India, due to decreased local evapotranspiration. Decreased evapotranspiration from a&#160;warmer surface since the 1950s in the CMIP5 ensemble may also feedback on the supply of moisture (Ramarao et&#160;al., 2015). Based on an AGCM study and literature review, Krishnan et&#160;al. (2016) support the role of land-use/land-cover change in adding to the effects of aerosol in weakening the monsoon, in addition to dynamic effects on the circulation caused by rapid warming of the Indian Ocean.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="546.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="546.6" x1="304.72" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 58.99; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In addition to anthropogenic forcing, there is evidence that internal variability in the Pacific is a&#160;significant driver. Huang et&#160;al. (2020b) compared a&#160;large perturbed-physics ensemble (HadCM3C) with a&#160;SMILE for the historical period. Ensemble members replicating the negative Indian rainfall trend were accompanied by a&#160;strong phase change in the PDV from negative to positive, consistent with SST observations. Jin and Wang (2017) have demonstrated increasing Indian monsoon rainfall since 2002 in a&#160;variety of observed datasets, suggesting the increase is due either to a&#160;change in dominance of a&#160;particular forcing (for example from aerosol to GHG) or to a&#160;change in phase of internal variability such as the PDV. Huang et&#160;al.

The spread in spatial distribution of aerosol emissions in SSPs may also play a&#160;role in near-term projections (Samset et&#160;al., 2019). Under divergent air-quality policies, SSP3 features a&#160;dipole of declining sulphate emissions for China but increases over India, leading to suppression of GHG-related precipitation increases there (Wilcox et&#160;al., 2020). For the near-term future around the mid-21st&#160;century, the interplay between internal variability and external forcing must be considered (Singh and AchutaRao, 2019). Huang et&#160;al. (2020a) used two SMILEs to show that internal variability related to PDV could potentially overcome the GHG-forced upward trend in Indian monsoon rainfall, consistent with assessments of the global monsoon for the near term (Section&#160;4.4.1.4). Emergence of the anthropogenic signal for South Asian precipitation is shown from the 2050s onwards in CMIP6 (Figure&#160;10.15b).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="486.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="486.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In long-term projections, robust signals consist of a&#160;weakened upper-tropospheric meridional temperature gradient, either due to upper-level heating over the tropical Pacific (Sooraj et&#160;al., 2015) or Indian oceans (Sabeerali and Ajayamohan, 2018) in CMIP5, and increased seasonal mean rainfall, including in CMIP6 (Almazroui et&#160;al., 2020b; B. Wang et&#160;al., 2021). The weakened temperature gradient combines with increased atmospheric stability to weaken the monsoon overturning circulation, with some findings showing northward movement of the lower-tropospheric monsoon winds in response to a&#160;stronger land&#8211;sea temperature contrast in CMIP3 and CMIP5 (Sandeep and Ajayamohan, 2015; Endo et&#160;al., 2018). The northward shift was also found in the genesis of synoptic systems (monsoon depressions) in a&#160;single high-resolution AGCM forced by an ensemble of SSTs derived from four GCMs under the RCP8.5 scenario (Sandeep et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="294.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="294.6" x1="563.23" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.78; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Projections can also be expressed in terms of global-mean warming levels (GWLs) rather than time horizons (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;11.1). Advancing on SR1.5, amplification of mean and extreme monsoon rainfall at 2.0&#176;C compared to 1.5&#176;C has been found both by an AGCM forced by future SST patterns (Chevuturi et&#160;al., 2018) and by using time slices in CMIP5 GCMs (Yaduvanshi et&#160;al., 2019; J. Zhang et&#160;al., 2020). These findings are consistent with the general scaling of Indian monsoon precipitation per degree of warming in CMIP5 (Zhang et&#160;al., 2019) and CMIP6 (B. Wang et&#160;al., 2021). Increasing GWLs also lead to emergence of the anthropogenic signal over larger proportions of the South Asian region (Figure&#160;10.15a).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.29" top="150.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="150.6" x1="563.29" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Decomposition of the increased rainfall signal showed that while the dynamic component led to a&#160;drying tendency, this was overcome by the thermodynamic contribution (Sooraj et&#160;al., 2015; Z. Chen et&#160;al., 2020). Alternative decomposition experiments using AGCMs and their coupled counterparts found increases in the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient and monsoon rainfall to be dominated by the fast radiative response to GHG increase rather than SST changes (Li and Ting, 2017; Endo et&#160;al., 2018). The response to SST forcing featured a&#160;large model spread, particularly arising from the dynamic </span></div></body></html>
