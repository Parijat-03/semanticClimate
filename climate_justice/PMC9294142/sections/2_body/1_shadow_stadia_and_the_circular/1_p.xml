<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The circular economy (CE) approach has been gaining recognition and consideration from multinational companies (Lacy et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There is also an increase in published researched on the CE in both the natural and social sciences (Kirchherr and van Santen, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Increased research on the subject over the last decade was arguably ignited by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation report in 2012 (Geissdoerfer et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) that called for a new economic model to address the proliferation of world-wide resource depletion (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
