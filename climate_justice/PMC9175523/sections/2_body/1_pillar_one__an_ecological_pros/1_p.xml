Global over-consumption is placing stress on Earth&#8217;s natural life-support systems as never before. World Wide Fund&#160;for&#160;Nature (WWF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>) have reported a 60% decline in overall populations of mammals, reptiles, fish, birds and amphibians in the 4 decades following 1970. Nevertheless, large swathes of the global population continue to experience the deprivations of poverty and resource scarcity (UNDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>). For example, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>, p 1) report that &#8220;17% of children born in 2000 in so-called low human development countries will have died before age 20, compared with a figure of 1% in very high human development countries&#8221;.</p>
