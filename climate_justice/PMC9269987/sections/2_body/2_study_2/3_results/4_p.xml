Contrary to expectations, moral disengagement was shown to be the only significant predictor whereas perpetrator, beneficiary, observer, and victim sensitivity, guilt, shame, authentic and hubristic pride, and gratitude were non-significant predictors. Hence, Hypotheses 1b, 2b, and 3b were not supported.</p>
