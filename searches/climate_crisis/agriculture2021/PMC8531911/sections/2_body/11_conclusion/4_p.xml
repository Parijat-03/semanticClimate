Meanwhile, a UNEP spokesperson claimed agriculture accounts for 70% of biodiversity loss and 80% of deforestation, and while international finance offers $105b a year for climate change and deforestation, &#8216;governments are providing $470bn [in farm support] that has a huge damaging impact on climate and nature&#8217;. And this support includes &#8216;price incentives for specific livestock and crops, subsidies for fertilisers and pesticides, and distorting export subsidies and import tariffs&#8217; (Carrington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>).</p>
