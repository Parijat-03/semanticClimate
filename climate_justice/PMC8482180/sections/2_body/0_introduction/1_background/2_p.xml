Indigenous food systems are particularly sensitive to climate change, as many Indigenous communities live in areas experiencing rapid environmental changes. Moreover, competing demands for land due to expanding resource extraction have adversely impacted the subsistence of Indigenous communities [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a result, even subtle changes in the environment can have a disproportionately greater impact on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; food security and sovereignty [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
