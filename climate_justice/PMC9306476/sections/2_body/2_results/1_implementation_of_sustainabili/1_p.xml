<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We collected information from all TropEd institutions and conducted key informant interviews with 11 representatives of 9 out of ten TropEd institutions (Table <xref rid="tmi13714-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and we were unable to conduct an interview with staff from the Institute for Global Health, University College London. Online information was not available in English from three of the TropEd institutions. The 10&#160;home institutions are located across Europe, some are independent, and some are part of a university.</p>
