<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The OLS regression models were run for our three demographic variables (median income, percent Latinx, and percent Black population) against our three temperature scenarios. In each equation, population was also used as a control factor.
