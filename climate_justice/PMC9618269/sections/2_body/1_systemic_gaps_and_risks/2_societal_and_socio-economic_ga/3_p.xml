Insects are generally ectotherms, which implies that their body temperature is linked to their external environment, making them highly sensitive to climatic conditions (Moiroux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>). Changing climate conditions can therefore further the population distribution, growth rates, and number of generations of pests which will have severe implications on agricultural productivity and livelihoods. The associations between climate and energy are unparalleled; energy systems are susceptible to high temperatures which elicit surges in demand whilst putting strains on supply and transmission. These systems have a vital role to play in supporting adaptation by enhancing cooling and heating irrigations and trade. Households and industries use a high amount of energy in maintaining indoor climates based on external weather conditions (Auffhammer and Mansur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Cian and Wing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). This demand rises as global temperature increases and falls and the global temperature cools. It is also noteworthy to mention that energy utilisation is the greatest contributor to anthropogenic climate change.</p>
