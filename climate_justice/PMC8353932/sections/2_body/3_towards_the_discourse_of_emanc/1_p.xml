From a communication perspective, however, scarcity discourse holds a more serious risk of inhibiting our cognitive capacity to imagine human life beyond the prevention of dangerous climate change. Under a narrow mindset of scarcity, we are forced to see climate change merely as the managerial problem of staying within a given physical limit. Despite the fact that climate change is an inherently complex and politically contentious challenge, our attention is fixated on hitting temperature targets or adhering to emissions budgets as some kind of &#8216;a common single destination&#8217; (Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020b</xref>). There is no future imagined beyond these numbers. The scarcity discourse closes down our future until the &#8216;point of no return&#8217;&#8212;a point that, if crossed, the world will be destined to be the end. This is the <italic>discursive limit</italic> of communicating climate change through a lens of physical scarcity.</p>
