Many glacier lakes have increased in volume, and can damage hydropower infrastructure when they empty suddenly (Engeset et al., 2005; Jackson and Ragulina, 2014; Carrivick and Tweed, 2016) (Section&#160;2.3.2; Figure 2.7). If large enough, hydropower reservoirs can reduce the downstream negative impacts of changes in the cryosphere by storing and providing freshwater during hot, dry periods or by alleviating the effects of glacier &#64258;oods (Jackson and Ragulina, 2014; Colonia et al., 2017). In mountain rivers, sediment volume and type depend on connectivity between hillslopes and the valley &#64258;oor (Carrivick et al., 2013), glacier activity (Lane et al., 2017) and on water runoff regime feedbacks with river channel dynamics (Schmidt and Morche, 2006). An increase in suspended sediment loading under current reservoir operating policies is projected for some hydropower facilities, for example, in British Columbia and Northern Washington (Lee et al., 2016). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="411.56"><span x0="59.53" y0="411.56" x1="307.57" style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.34; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Only a few studies have addressed the economic effects on hydropower due directly to changes in the cryosphere.

In the Southern Andes, increased stream&#64258;ow in the Elqui River in Chile, due to glacier retreat or changing snow cover, has led to increased water availability for irrigation and increased agricultural yields (Young et al., 2010).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="495.56"><span x0="318.05" y0="495.56" x1="566.12" style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 495.56; y1: 505.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In addition to the effects on agriculture of changing availability of irrigation water, reductions in snow cover can also impact agriculture through its direct effects on soil moisture, as reported for Nepal, where lesser snow cover has led to the drying of soils and lower yields of potatoes and fodder (Smadja et al., 2015). Agriculture in high mountain areas is sensitive to other climatic drivers as well. Rising air temperatures increase crop evapotranspiration, thus increasing water demand for crop production to maintain optimal yield (Beniston and Stoffel, 2014). They are also associated with upslope movement of cropping zones, which favours some farmers in high mountain areas, who are increasingly able to cultivate new crops, such as onions, garlic and apples in Nepal (Huntington et al., 2017; Hussain et al., 2018), and maize in Ecuador (Skarb&#248; and VanderMolen, 2014).

Agriculture in these areas is sensitive to non-climate drivers as well, such as market forces and political pressures (Montana et al., 2016; Sietz and Feola, 2016; Figueroa-Armijos and Valdivia, 2017) and shifts in water governance (Rasmussen, 2016). The majority of the adaptation activities are autonomous, though some are planned or carried out with support from national governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), or international aid organisations. Though many studies report on bene&#64257;ts from these activities which accrue to community members as increased harvests and income, systematic evaluations of these adaptation strategies are generally lacking. A range of factors, discussed below, place barriers which limit the scale and scope of these activities in the mountain agricultural sector, including a lack of &#64257;nance and technical knowledge,&#160;low adaptive capacity within communities, ill-equipped state organisations, ambiguous property rights and inadequate institutional and market support (</span><span style="x0: 534.62; x1: 541.48; y0: 99.61; y1: 109.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="534.62" y0="99.61" x1="566.1">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span x0="417.85" y0="87.62" x1="566.11" style="x0: 417.85; x1: 420.49; y0: 87.62; y1: 97.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).
