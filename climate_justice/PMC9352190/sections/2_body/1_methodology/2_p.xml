<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0004">We performed a rapid literature search of academic journals in PubMed and Google Scholar between March 9 and April 9, 2021. The review was restricted to English-language academic publications from 2006 to 2021. The search terms include [(&#8220;HIV&#8221; OR &#8220;AIDS&#8221; OR &#8220;HIV/AIDS&#8221; OR &#8220;human immunodeficiency virus&#8221;) AND (&#8220;climate change&#8221; OR &#8220;global warming&#8221; OR &#8220;climate emergency&#8221; OR &#8220;natural disasters&#8221;)]. Articles were screened by title, abstract, or full-text review to identify major pathways by which HIV/AIDS and climate change interact. The initial set of themes that were found were food insecurity, air pollution, drought, flooding, and infectious diseases. A second search from April 9 to April 15, 2021 was done to look for articles linking the proposed pathways from the first search to HIV/AIDS. Search terms include [(&#8220;HIV&#8221; OR &#8220;AIDS&#8221; OR &#8220;HIV/AIDS&#8221; OR &#8220;human immunodeficiency virus&#8221;) AND (&#8220;food insecurity&#8221; OR &#8220;air pollution&#8221; OR &#8220;drought&#8221; OR &#8220;flooding&#8221; OR &#8220;infectious disease&#8221;)]. An additional search for sea level rise from August 29 to September 5, 2021 was conducted because of its significance to the Philippines which is facing one of the fastest rates of sea level rise in the world <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Specific pathways from the additional searches were compiled and synthesized into a conceptual framework. The framework by Lieber et&#160;al. was used as a skeleton for the updated framework <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
