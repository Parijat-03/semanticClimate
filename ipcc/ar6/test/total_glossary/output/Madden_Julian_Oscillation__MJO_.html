As it progresses, the MJO is associated with the temporal alternation of large-scale enhanced and suppressed rainfall, with maximum loading over the Indian and western Pacific oceans, although influences of the MJO can be tracked over the Atlantic/Africa in dynamical fields. See Section AIV.2.8 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></div></dd><div>
