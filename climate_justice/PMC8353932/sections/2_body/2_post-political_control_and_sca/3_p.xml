Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>; L&#246;vbrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>). Given that scarcity means &#8216;having less than you feel you need&#8217; (Mullainathan and Shafir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>), managing scarcity requires being more attentive and efficient. Under conditions of scarcity, people cannot afford to waste limited resources. More prudent and effective management is crucial for preventing the overuse of scarce resource or the exceedance of physical limits. Here managing scarcity comes into conflict with democratic politics. It is because democratic decision-making often undergoes a slow process and hence may not suffice to produce decisive actions during a crisis. As scarcity discourse generates a growing sense of the climate crisis among the public, the legitimacy of the democratic mode of governance might be challenged in the name of &#8216;emergency&#8217; (Hulme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>; Nisbet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>).</p>
