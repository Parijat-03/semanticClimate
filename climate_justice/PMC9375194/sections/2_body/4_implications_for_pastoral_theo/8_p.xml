It is somewhat akin to the important shift in the field of mental health counseling, where the traditional scientist-practitioner model of counseling and psychotherapy has evolved into a threefold approach with the addition of social justice advocacy. The model of scientist-practitioner-advocate can serve as an important touchstone for pastoral and spiritual care providers working in an era of climate emergency. Paying very close attention to the evidence-based science of climate change and to the impact it is having on the physical, psychological, and spiritual health of those in our care, in particular those who are most vulnerable, we become more highly informed and effective practitioners. We also become more aware of the trauma associated with prolonged heat and drought, as well as the trauma associated with natural disasters.</p>
