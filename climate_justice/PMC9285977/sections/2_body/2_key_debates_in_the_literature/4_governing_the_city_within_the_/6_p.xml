Regardless of how networked they are, municipal authorities are constrained by bounded autonomy which determines their ability to raise resources and make decisions (Romero&#8208;Lankao, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0243" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Entrenched administrative rationalities and identities inhibit collaboration across government units (Aylett, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Despite the best of intentions, communication, resource sharing, and learning across or between government levels may be weak (Antonson &amp; Carlson, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Araos, Ford, Berrang&#8208;Ford, Biesbroek, &amp; Moser, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Jaglin, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0163" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Leck &amp; Simon, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0182" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Depending on the institutional arrangements across different levels of government (national, regional, local) cities may be overlooked by higher&#8208;level authorities (Jones, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0165" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Multiple authority&#8208;building practices occur outside the sphere of activity of the public sector but may fail to build the legitimacy required for broad institutionalization (Francesch&#8208;Huidobro, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0129" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or provide secure mechanisms of accountability and monitoring (Bache, Bartle, Flinders, &amp; Marsden, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Butterfield &amp; Low, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zengerling, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0300" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
