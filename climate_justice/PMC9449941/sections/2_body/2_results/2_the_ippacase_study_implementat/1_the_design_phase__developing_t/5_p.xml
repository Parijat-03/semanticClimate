By privileging alternative drive systems, the measure is intended to create incentives for users to decide to purchase vehicles with alternative drive systems. This will be directly supported by the accompanying measures &#8220;reform of the motor vehicle tax&#8221; in favour of climate-friendly, fuel-efficient and light vehicles, and &#8220;guidelines on parking fees&#8221;.</p>
