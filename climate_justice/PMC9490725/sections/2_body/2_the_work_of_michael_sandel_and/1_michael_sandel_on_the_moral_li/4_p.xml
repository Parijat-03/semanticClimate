The first is that the result may be unfair (e.g. poor people can&#8217;t get access to healthcare, tickets for concerts are bought by scalpers and corporates who even leave seats empty, lobbyists buy influence): &#8220;market choices are not free choices if some are desperately poor or lack the ability to bargain on fair terms&#8221; (112). The second is that the result may actually be less effective than a non-market mechanism (e.g. blood donations are higher when people do it for free, more rather than fewer parents leave their children at childcare after hours when they pay). The third objection is that they can corrupt the social norms (e.g. even after the childcare fee was taken away, the behaviour of leaving children after hours remained): &#8220;markets are not mere mechanisms; they embody certain values. And sometimes, market values crowd out non-market norms worth caring about&#8221; (113). Sandel later summarises these three objections into two: the fairness objection (some have called this Rawlsian) and the corruption objection (some have called this Aristotelian). He writes: &#8220;The fairness objection asks about the inequality that market choices may reflect; the corruption objection asks about the attitudes and norms that market relations may damage or dissolve&#8221; (110).</p>
