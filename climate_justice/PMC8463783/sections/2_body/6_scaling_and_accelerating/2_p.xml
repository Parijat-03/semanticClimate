Aligning this immense stimulus with biosphere stewardship principles would provide the financial muscle to drive the transformations we identify above&#8212;a once-in-a-generation opportunity to catalyze resilient post-COVID revitalization that accelerates integrated action toward a manageable climate future.</p>
