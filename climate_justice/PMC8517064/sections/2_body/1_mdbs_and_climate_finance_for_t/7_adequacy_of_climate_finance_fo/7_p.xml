The main aim of the project is to improve access to financing for activities that promote climate resilient agriculture for farmers organisations, women and youth associations, cooperatives; Micro-, Small- and Medium-sized, Enterprises, Micro Finance Institutions and commercial banks. The financing structure of the project included GCF financing of 8.5 million euros to the Government of Niger for on-lending by the Agricultural Bank of Niger, as well as a grant for technical assistance, IFAD grant co-financing of 2.12 million euros to be provided in sub-grants, and 850,000 euros co-financing by the Agricultural Bank of Niger to be used for sub-loans together with the GCF resources. IFAD had hoped to submit this proposal through the simplified approval process of the GCF (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/projects/sap">https://www.greenclimate.fund/projects/sap</ext-link>) which IFAD is eligible for as an accredited UN entity. However, the inclusion of the Agricultural Bank of Niger in the funding structure created complications since it is not an accredited agency with the GCF. It is also a private and not public bank, which created complications for IFAD which at the time did not have the necessary institutional arrangements to work with private sector entities. This example illustrates how expanding the adaptation resources via co-financing faces serious bureaucratic hurdles. IFAD internal communication.</p>
