<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">A mode of interannual variability that features an eastâwest dipole of <em>sea surface temperature</em> anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. Its positive phase shows concurrent sea surface cooling off Sumatra and Java and warming off Somalia in the west, combined with anomalous surface easterlies along the equator, while the opposite anomalies are seen in the negative phase. The IOD typically develops in boreal summer and matures in boreal autumn and controls part of the rainfall interannual variability in Australia, South Eastern Asia and Eastern Africa. See Section AIV.2.4 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></dd>
