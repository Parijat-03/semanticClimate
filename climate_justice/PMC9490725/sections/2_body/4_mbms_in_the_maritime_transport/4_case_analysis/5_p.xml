We are expecting business to find solutions when it is clear that the current system incentivises the opposite. The impasse cannot be broken by redesigning the institutional relationships between different public and private organisations or identifying if this or that country or shipping line is obstructing MBM agreement at the IMO MEPC. The collective action problem cannot be solved with market logic or financial incentives. Moreover, the problem is not only the weakness of the proposed MBMs, but the fact that no MBM has yet been agreed at all at the global level. The IMO member countries, frequently represented at meetings by industry actors, continue to delay and postpone. Market-based environmental governance has created a situation where only weak solutions are proposed, which are then endlessly discussed, faults identified, and then postponed for further discussion, making it impossible for any transformative policy to break through.</p>
