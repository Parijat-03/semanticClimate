It has been peopled since colonial times by the Baiote &#8211; a sub-group of the Diola, which possesses characteristic cultural and religious practices, a high labor ethic, the prohibition of theft, and a preference for the cultivation of African rice varieties (Linares, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>; Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>). They have a segmentary (non-hierarchical) political organization, governed by a body of elders (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) with both political and religious powers (Linares, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1992</xref>). The Diola (Felupe and Baiote sub-groups) have around 20 villages in the Guinea-Bissau territory.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Guinea-Bissau in the African Continent, <bold>b</bold> Cacheu region, the Cacheu protected area and the study area, <bold>c</bold> Landsat OLI (RGB754) color composite of the year 2019, with the study area defined by the sea branch surrounding Djobel village</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10745_2022_352_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Partial view of a council of elders' meeting following a ritual at one of the main spirit's shrines</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10745_2022_352_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
