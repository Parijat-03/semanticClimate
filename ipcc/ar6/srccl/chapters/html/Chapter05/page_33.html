Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS) have a&#160;potential to improve food security and at the same time help protect and conserve traditional knowledge and biodiversity. Scaling-up NUS requires training farmers and other stakeholders on ways to adopt adequate crop management, quality seed, select varieties, farming systems, soil management, development of new products, and market opportunities (Padulosi et al. 2013). Farmers in the Rasuwa district, in the mid-hills of Nepal, prefer to cultivate local bean, barley, millet and local maize, rather than commodity crops because they are more tolerant to water stress and extremely cold&#160;conditions (Adhikari et al. 2017). Farmers in the high-altitude, cold climate of Nepal prefer local barley with its short growing period because of a&#160;shorter growing window. Buckwheat is commonly grown in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region mainly because it grows fast and suppresses weeds.

Various factors are responsible for this, and lack of diversity in food and nutrition resulting from production and consumption of few crops is one of them. In the past, food baskets in this region consisted of many different edible plant species, many of which are now neglected and underutilised. This is because almost all the efforts of the Green Revolution after 1960 focused on major crops. Four crops, namely rice, wheat, maize and potato, account for about 60% of global plant-derived energy supply (Padulosi et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="79.68" right="557.6" top="483.13"><span style="x0: 79.68; x1: 87.24; y0: 483.13; y1: 492.63; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.68" y0="483.13" x1="557.6">While the Green Revolution technologies substantially increased the yield of few crops and allowed countries to reduce hunger, they also resulted in inappropriate and excessive use of agrochemicals, inefficient water use, loss of beneficial biodiversity, water and soil pollution and significantly reduced crop and varietal diversity. With farming systems moving away from subsistence-based to commercial farming, farmers are also reluctant to grow these local crops because of low return, poor market value and lack of knowledge about their nutritional environmental value. </span></div><div left="79.68" right="557.54" top="411.14"><span style="x0: 79.68; x1: 85.13; y0: 411.14; y1: 420.64; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.68" y0="411.14" x1="557.54">However, transition from traditional diets based on local foods to a&#160;commercial crop-based diet with high fats, salt, sugar and processed foods, increased the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart diseases and certain types of cancer (Abarca-G&#243;mez et al. 2017; NCD-RisC 2016b, 2017b).

In one study carried out in two villages of mid-hills in Nepal, Khanal et al. (2015) reported 52 indigenous crop species belonging to 27 families with their various uses. Farming communities continue to grow various indigenous crops, albeit in marginal land, because of their value on traditional food and associated culture. Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) has identified a&#160;list of indigenous crops based on their nutritional, medicinal, cultural and other values. </span></div><div left="79.68" right="557.57" top="219.17"><span style="x0: 79.68; x1: 87.07; y0: 219.17; y1: 228.67; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.68" y0="219.17" x1="557.57">Many indigenous crops supply essential micronutrients to the human body, and need to be conserved in mountain food systems. Farmers in HKH region are cultivating and maintaining various indigenous crops such as Amaranthus, barley, black gram, horse gram, yam, and sesame. because of their nutritional value. Most of these indigenous crops are comparable with commercial cereals in terms of dietary energy and protein content, but are also rich in micronutrients. For example, pearl millet has higher content of&#160;calcium, iron, zinc, riboflavin and folic acid than rice or maize (Adhikari et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="79.68" right="557.63" top="147.17"><span style="x0: 79.68; x1: 85.49; y0: 147.17; y1: 156.67; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.68" y0="147.17" x1="557.63">NUS can provide both climate resilience and more options for dietary diversity to the farming communities of mountain ecosystems.&#160;Some of these indigenous crops have high medical importance.
