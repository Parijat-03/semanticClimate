This includes the Port Authority as well as the local and national government. In addition, these protests try to remind cruise tourists of the structural conditions that enable their travels, and to make them aware of the blind spots the latter have. But protests of this kind also function as networking opportunities for their participants. In 2017, protests were explicitly used to create the &#8220;European assembly of movements for the defense of territories, for climate justice and democracy.&#8221; The assembly took place in the S.a.L.E. Docks and called for a&#160;&#8220;new European cycle of battles&#8221; (No Grandi Navi 2021).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> Brochures on display provided information on local and global initiatives.
