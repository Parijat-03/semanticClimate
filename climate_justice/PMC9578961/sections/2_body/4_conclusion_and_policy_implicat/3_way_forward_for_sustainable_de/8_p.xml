Also, scholars and practitioners could disentangle the issue through different approaches, alternative content analysis outlooks or even other techniques and theoretical premises. A future research agenda may make use of alternative methodologies to define and rationalise existing literature on the topic &#8211; such as bibliometrics and composite indicators.
