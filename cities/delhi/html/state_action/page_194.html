This includes rails, roads, waterways and airport/aircrafts (CICERO, 2011). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="132.38" top="712.71"><span x0="72.02" y0="712.71" x1="132.38" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 712.71; y1: 724.71; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Sensitivity: </span><span x0="132.26" y0="712.71" x1="526.25" style="x0: 132.26; x1: 139.59; y0: 712.71; y1: 724.71; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">This includes roads and bridges that would be severely affected by the increase in rainfall intensity (increasing traffic congestion and wear and tear). This may lead to increased travel time and increased expenditure for repair of traffic infrastructure (CICERO, 2011). The rising greenhouse gas emissions are also known to be corrosive and may damage existing infrastructure (Kumar, et al., 2012). It has also been found that extreme rainfall events can lead to increase in the number of road accidents (Millelo, et al., 2010) </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.22" top="605.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="605.43" x1="526.22" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 605.43; y1: 617.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The old infrastructure (roads and bridges) in the city would be disproportionately vulnerable to increasing temperature and high intensity rainfall. The busier roads in the city, with inadequate drainage infrastructure would be at risk of submersion from the high intensity rainfall, this may disproportionately affect low lying areas in the city (US EPA, 2012). The high traffic flows may also lead to increased accidents during intense rainfall due to reduced visibility (US EPA, 2012). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.37" top="498.24"><span x0="72.02" y0="498.24" x1="526.37" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 498.24; y1: 510.24; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Adaptive Capacity: There are several efforts being made to incentivize non-motorized transport in various small and medium sized cities across the country. In Delhi these efforts include a massive mass transit system in the form of the Delhi Metro, changing fuel input in buses from diesel to CNG, other measures to incentivize public transport like Bus Rapid Transport systems. This is in addition to subsidies provided by the government for the use of electric vehicles.  These efforts will serve to optimize land use in transportation, lower emissions and reduce traffic congestion. The national mission on sustainable habitat aims to improve storm drainage in Indian cities. There is however a need to integrate the impacts of climate change into transport planning. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.23" top="343.42"><span x0="72.02" y0="343.42" x1="526.23" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 343.42; y1: 355.42; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are currently very few measures being undertaken by the government to adapt to these changes. To adapt to these changes, transport infrastructure needs to be designed in a climate resilient manner, so as to reduce traffic disruption and make travel safer. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="295.01" top="284.71"><span x0="72.02" y0="284.71" x1="295.01" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 77.54; y0: 284.71; y1: 295.75; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">15.2.6 Forest, Biodiversity and Agriculture </span><span x0="72.02" y0="269.23" x1="526.1" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 269.23; y1: 281.23; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The area of Delhi under agriculture has declined steadily to 23 percent of the total geographical area in 2010 from more than 30 percent about a decade ago. The crop intensity of the state has also seen a decline in the past few years (Delhi Economic Survey). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.27" top="209.59"><span x0="72.02" y0="209.59" x1="526.27" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 209.59; y1: 221.59; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Although there has been an increase in the forest area in Delhi, this forested land may be at risk from changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. These may serve to cause degradation of the forests in question. The changing pattern of green spaces and built up area in the city of Delhi has led to a change in the biodiversity. These changes may be further exacerbated with the increasing rate of urbanization and population increase that is projected for the city-state of Delhi. Changes in weather patterns would also serve to intensify loss in biodiversity (National Climate Centre, 2011).  </span></div></body></html>
