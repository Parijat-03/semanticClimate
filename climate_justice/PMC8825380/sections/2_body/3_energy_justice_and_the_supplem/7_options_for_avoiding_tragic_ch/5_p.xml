To Holland, such conflicts should &#8216;initiate long-term planning efforts that will allocate resources away from supporting entitlements that are not fundamental and toward supporting threshold level of capabilities that define the conditions of justice&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>: 415). While it may be possible to still raise everyone to the threshold levels through imposing ceilings and redistribution of resources and ensuring energy availability of the least well-off, resources in the future may still be too scarce to allow everyone to be over the threshold, which would result in tragic choices. It is more consistent with demands of justice to impose non-tragic ceilings now than to enjoy unrestricted freedom and face tragic choices later.</p>
