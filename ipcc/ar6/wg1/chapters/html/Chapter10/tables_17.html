      <td>The Arctic has very likely warmed more than twice the global rate over the past 50 years with the greatest increase during the cold\nseason (Atlas.11.2). Several mechanisms are responsible for the enhanced lower troposphere warming of the Arctic, including ice\nalbedo, lapse rate, Planck and cloud feedbacks (Section 7.4.4.1). The rapid Arctic warming strongly affects the ocean, atmosphere,\nand cryosphere in that region (Section 2.3.2.1 and Atlas.11.2). Averaged over the decade 2010&#8211;2019, monthly average sea ice area\nin August, September and October has been about 25% smaller than during 1979&#8211;1988 (high confidence) (Section 9.3.1.1). It is very\nlikely that anthropogenic forcings mainly due to greenhouse gas increases have contributed substantially to Arctic sea ice loss since\n1979, explaining at least half of the observed long-term decrease in summer sea ice extent (Section 3.4.1.1).</td>
