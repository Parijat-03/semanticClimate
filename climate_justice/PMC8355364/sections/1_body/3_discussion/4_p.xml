<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The finding that being angry may have promoted engagement is also consistent with studies in collective action research, such as <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al.&#8217;s (2008)</xref> SIMCA model and <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barth et al.&#8217;s (2015)</xref> findings postulating the predictive value of group-based outrage for collective action participation (for a review, see <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren, 2013</xref>). <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. (2009)</xref> also considered outrage directed at a system or at those responsible for the system to be particularly conducive for participation in social-political movements to overcome social injustices. Shared outrage toward third parties or the system causes group boundaries between the privileged and the disadvantaged to crumble and reinforces the norm of fighting together for structural change. The fact that no text passages with the deductive category of guilt could be coded at the respondents&#8217; start of engagement also goes hand in hand with <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al.&#8217;s (2009)</xref> postulate that guilt tends to motivate &#8220;fig leaf&#8221; actions, which was not the case for the respondents, since they were seriously and strongly committed to their engagement. It is possible, however, that collective guilt was also implicitly expressed in the sense of responsibility category. Collective fear, in contrast to outrage, did not seem to contribute to a commitment to solve the threat of climate change, which contradicted the existing literature about the effects on participation in collective action of experimentally manipulated fear (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
