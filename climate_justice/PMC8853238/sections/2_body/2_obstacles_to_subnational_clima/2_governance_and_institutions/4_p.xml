Formal powers are in part a product of other institutional arrangements, such as the presence or absence of term limits (Carey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>; Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2012</xref>; Shay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2020</xref>). Basseches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>) shows that the concentration of institutional power in the hands of majority party leadership, even when the majority party is Democratic, facilitates access and influence for business actors while limiting it for environmental groups.</p>
