The science museum exhibition <italic>Heureka Goes Crazy</italic> (Heureka The Finnish Science Centre) and the slightly customized American renamed version <italic>Mental Health: Mind Matters</italic> (Science Museum of Minnesota, U.S.A.) attend to complex and sensitive socio-scientific issues related to mental health. Their shared institutional goals include the following: raising awareness and demystifying social preconceptions about mental health and mental illness; engaging visitors with topics that have been historically considered taboo; destigmatizing mental health; and developing empathy (Rosenstr&#246;m, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>; Science Museum of Minnesota, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>). These are striking examples of two science museums&#8217; deliberate and explicit articulation to promote empathy, and by implication social change and transformation, through their exhibitionary practices. Both of these exhibits call on the visitor to engage critically, emotionally, and sometimes in the place of &#8220;other&#8221; to develop empathy, compassion, and understandings (in terms of both knowledge and feelings).</p>
