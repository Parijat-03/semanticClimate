The city divided the project into different compartments to be built in phases along the Manhattan coastline. The first phase would be built on the east side of lower Manhattan, partly as a response to the damaging flooding that affected public housing residents in the LES during Sandy. The East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, as it was named, would redevelop East River Park based on intensive collaboration with LES neighborhood residents. From 2015 to early 2018, city agencies continued the participation and collaborative design process that BIG started, and by 2018, the self-described &#8220;radically inclusive&#8221; plan was ready to go into the city&#8217;s land use planning process (see DuPuis &amp; Greenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref> for a detailed timeline of the process).</p>
