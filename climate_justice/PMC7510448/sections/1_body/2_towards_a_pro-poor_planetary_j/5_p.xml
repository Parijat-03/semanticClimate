For instance, behavioral change across four major categories&#8212;food, agriculture and land management, transportation, and energy and materials&#8212;could contribute to as much as 19% to 38% emission reductions, compared to a reference case of projected cumulative emissions from 2020-2050 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et&#160;al., 2018</xref>). A pro-poor planetary justice perspective would need to ensure that such fundamental transformation in patterns and practices of consumption are supported by requisite structural reforms in the economy so that the burden does not fall disproportionately on the poor.</p>
