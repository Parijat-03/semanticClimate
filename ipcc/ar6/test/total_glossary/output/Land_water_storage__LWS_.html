<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">Land water storage (LWS) includes all surface water, <em>soil moisture</em>, groundwater storage and snow, but excludes water stored in <em>glaciers</em> and <em>ice sheets</em>. Changes in LWS can be caused either by direct human intervention in the water cycle (e.g., storage of water in reservoirs by building dams in rivers, groundwater extraction from groundwater reservoirs for consumption and irrigation, or <em>deforestation</em>) or by <em>climate</em> variations (e.g., changes in the amount of water in endorheic lakes and <em>wetlands</em>, the canopy, the soil, the <em>permafrost</em> and the snowpack). Land water storage changes caused by climate variations may also be indirectly affected by <em>anthropogenic</em> influences.</p></dd>
