<abstract><title>Abstract</title><p>George Floyd&#8217;s death, the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and climate change are on a continuum from the immediate shock of viewing a video&#8208;recorded murder, to millions dying worldwide from disease, to deaths related to climate change accumulating over a millennium. They participate in the powerful archetypes of death and inequality. &#8216;Increase&#8217;, Hexagram 42 in the <italic toggle="yes">I Ching</italic>, archetypically addresses inequalities at all levels &#8211; racial, economic, political and the profound imbalance between humans and the environment. Floyd&#8217;s death highlights the consequences of systemic racism and income inequalities. The pandemic as &#8216;nature&#8217;s revenge&#8217; hits minority populations harder due to underlying health conditions resulting from poverty and greater exposure to the virus in the workplace. President Trump as Trickster showed Americans their shadow and his response to the pandemic amplified its severity. The pandemic has shocked our social, political and economic systems and paused our species rush into environmental disasters at many levels. The disruptions present opportunities for reflection, experimentation and developing new systems as old forms are challenged. The ecological dimensions of Jung&#8217;s concepts emphasize interconnectedness at all levels and the paradigm shift he called a &#8216;new age&#8217; provides a framework for altering the course of the Anthropocene Era.</p></abstract>
