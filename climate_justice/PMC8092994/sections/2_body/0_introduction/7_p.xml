Accordingly, programs to effect &#8220;managed retreat,&#8221; from vulnerable areas (whether moving people, infrastructure, or both), are just beginning to emerge in the USA, as the corresponding research also continues to grow (Mach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). Indeed, in the USA, the primary method of &#8220;managed retreat&#8221; is implementation of existing home buy-out programs (Siders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). These programs have been in use in the USA for upwards of three decades or more, but many communities have only more recently begun to see residents take advantage of them, in part because of increasing disaster impacts, and because of increased awareness of and funding for programs focused on reducing risks through purchase and removal of homes following disasters.</p>
