It encompasses the mid-Holocene (MH), the 1000-year-long interval centred at 6000 years before 1950; a period of long-standing focus for climate modelling, with enhanced seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere and decreased seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere. The early part of the Holocene is marked by the late stages of <em>deglaciation</em> of Pleistocene land ice, sea level rise, and the occurrence of warm phases that affected different regions at different times, often referred to as the ‘Holocene Thermal Maximum’. In addition, the epoch includes the post-glacial interval, which began approximately 7000 years ago when the fundamental features of the modern <em><a href="#climate_system" class="mention">climate system</a></em> were essentially in place, as the influence of remnant Pleistocene<em><a href="#ice_sheet" class="mention"> ice sheets</a></em> waned.</p></div><div class="ms-2 p-1 small text-muted"><h6 class="mb-0">References</h6> - Otto-Bliesner et al.
