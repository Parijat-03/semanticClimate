<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The environmental movement has long used legal action to challenge polluters and government inaction or collusion. The health community can lend its support. At the least, litigation pushes the issues further into the public domain and can force governments and companies to respond. Courts can also issue injunctions to stop ongoing harms, require governments to review permits afresh, order both compensation and, where possible, repairs to damaged environments at the polluters&#8217; expense. Most important are the opportunities generated for public scrutiny and debate.</p>
