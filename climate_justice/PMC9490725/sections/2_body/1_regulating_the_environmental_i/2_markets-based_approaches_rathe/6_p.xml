Felli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>: 64) argues for the need of a more politically informed analysis of the dominance of MBMs, pointing out that &#8220;the choice of policy instruments is itself highly political and should not simply be understood as a mere technical device designed to implement a given policy&#8221;. In order to understand why market-based approaches are normalised and others rendered invisible, the dominance of market thinking in politics needs to be considered. Thus in the following section, the literature on market ethics will be reviewed, in order to identify how an understanding of the moral limits of markets in general, and the work of Michael Sandel on the crowding out of non-market norms in particular, can be used to elucidate how this process of rendering direct regulation invisible occurs in the policy process.</p>
