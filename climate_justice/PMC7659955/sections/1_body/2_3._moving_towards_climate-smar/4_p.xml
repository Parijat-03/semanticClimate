The implication of the above expository listing of the fundamental parts of climate-smart agriculture means that for a smart village to be so called, it must strive to maintain within its agricultural systems all different aspects of CSA. Furthermore, other aspects of the smart culture within the smart village setting; smart energy management, smart living and smart healthcare, etc., must tap from these fundamental attributes of CSA, in order to provide robust services in their smart village functions. </p>
