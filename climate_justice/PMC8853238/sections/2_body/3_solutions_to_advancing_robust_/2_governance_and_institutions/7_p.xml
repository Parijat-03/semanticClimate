Regarding climate change, three strands of local lobbying efforts are evident. First, municipal lobbying is most often aimed at acquiring money and resources&#8212;as illustrated by the coordinated efforts advocating the inclusion of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants (EECBG) in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (US Conference of Mayors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2014</xref>). Second, local governments may lobby their state governments for the expanded authority necessary to enact specific portions of their climate action plans (Hughes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2019</xref>). Finally, local governments and trans-municipal networks can seek to persuade higher levels of government to enact their own climate policies (Lee and Jung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2018</xref>; Curtis and Acuto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>). For example, cities may ask their states to develop comprehensive energy plans, and organize efforts to sway international bodies to adopt stricter mitigation commitments.</p>
