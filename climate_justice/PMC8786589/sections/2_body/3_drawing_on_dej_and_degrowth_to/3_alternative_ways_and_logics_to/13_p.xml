There is a need to decentralize power and authority and encourage bottom-up leadership for transformations that can offer a safe political space for marginalized or oppressed groups (Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>). Local and bottom-up leadership examples across the world show an affinity for direct democracy, local autonomy and non-violence (Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>). Examples of people-centred bottom-up leadership where people come together to organize and govern their political, economic and ecological affairs exist across the world. Such leaderships challenge state oppression, racism, casteism, sexism, patriarchy and other forms of social injustice and marginalization, including those rooted in their own culture (e.g. tackling discrimination related to gender, ethnicities, caste etc.). Examples include, but are not limited to, the Kurdish Rojava women&#8217;s movement for autonomy and direct democracy (Gills and Hosseini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>) and various movements for ecological stewardship, food and seed sovereignty, economies of caring and sharing, self-determination and autonomy (Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2019</xref>).</p>
