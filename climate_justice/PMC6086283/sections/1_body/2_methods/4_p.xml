For instance, the acceleration of techno-scientific innovation for climate change mitigation and adaptation is one such process. The deceleration of technical products&#8217; obsolescence rates and private consumerism are examples of a second temporal process. The method of temporal classification of prevalent processes is standard and crucial in complex systems analysis (Simon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>; Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>). Moreover, studying temporal diversity may lead to operationalizing conceptual models and is important in addressing sustainability problems. This is recognized for example in the fields of sustainable chemistry and health services (Weiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>; Sarriot and Kouletio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Cash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>).</p>
