<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Build the Evidence Base: Additional research is needed to identify the health impacts of climate change in rural communities and to inform the development and implementation of locally and culturally appropriate solutions. High-priority climate change and health research areas were previously described [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. With the goal of improving the evidence based in support of rural LHD&#8217;s climate change and health programming, specific research questions of interest may include: To what extent has climate change already resulted in illness, injury, and death among rural populations? How will rural health be impacted under various climate change and development scenarios? What is the impact of specific interventions, programs, and policies implemented by rural LHDs on rural health? What human and financial resources do rural LHDs need to effectively respond to climate change?</p>
