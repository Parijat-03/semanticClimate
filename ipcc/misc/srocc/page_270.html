For example, across the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, informal community by-laws were successfully used for regulating grazing, collection and cutting of herbs and wood, and which limited rangeland degradation (Gari&#160;2006; Hussein 2011). Pastoralists in Mongolia developed indigenous classi&#64257;cations of pasture resources which facilitated ecologically optimal grazing practices (Fernandez-Gimenez 2000) (Section&#160;3.6.2).

North Atlantic SST anomalies are positively correlated with Sahel rainfall anomalies (Knight et al. 2006; Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2014; Sheen et al. 2017). While the eastern tropical Paci&#64257;c SST anomalies have a&#160;negative correlation with Sahel rainfall (Pomposi et al. 2016), a&#160;cooler North Atlantic is related to a&#160;drier Sahel, with this relationship enhanced if there is a&#160;simultaneous relative warming of the South Atlantic (Hoerling et al. 2006). Huber and Fensholt (2011) explored the relationship between SST anomalies and satellite observed Sahel vegetation dynamics, &#64257;nding similar relationships but with substantial west&#8211;east variations in both the signi&#64257;cant SST regions and the vegetation response. Concerning the paleoclimatic evidence on aridi&#64257;cation after the early Holocene &#8216;Green Sahara&#8217; period (11,000 to 5000 years ago), Tierney et al. (2017) indicate that a&#160;cooling of the North Atlantic played a&#160;role (Collins et al. 2017; Otto-Bliesner et al. 2014; Niedermeyer et al. 2009) similar to that found in modern observations. Besides these SST relationships, aerosols have also been suggested as a&#160;potential driver of the Sahel droughts (Rotstayn and Lohmann 2002; Booth et al. 2012; Ackerley et al. 2011).
