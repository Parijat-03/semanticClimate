Further validated by recent research in terms of their usefulness, these adaptation options include building and improving capital-intensive physical water infrastructure such as irrigation channels, flood-control dams and water storage (N&#252;sser and Schmidt, 2017). Drawing upon customary institutions and combining Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific knowledge, innovative structures, including artificial glaciers, ice stupas and snow barrier bands, have been built by local communities in Ladakh, Zanskar and Himachal Pradesh in India (Hock et&#160;al., 2019; N&#252;sser et&#160;al., 2019). Communities in Solukhumbu, Nepal, in response to depleting water flow in snow-fed rivers, have chosen adaptation through changing practices by collecting water from distant sources for domestic consumption (McDowell et&#160;al., 2013). Taking the IPCC concept of climate risk as a basis for adaptation planning, a pilot study of flood risk in Himachal Pradesh, India (Allen et&#160;al., 2018), integrating assessment of hazard, vulnerability and exposure in the complementary domains of CCA and DRR, has identified stakeholder consultation, knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building as key steps in adaptation planning. Aquifer storage and recovery has been proposed as an &#8216;alternative climate-proof freshwater source&#8217; for deltaic regions in Asia, particularly those with a history of saline groundwater aquifers (Hoque et&#160;al., 2016). It is further argued (Hadwen et&#160;al., 2015) that water, sanitation and hygiene objectives would need to be addressed as a component of a wider integrated water resource management (IWRM) framework.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="282.66"><span x0="42.52" y0="282.66" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.92; y0: 282.66; y1: 292.16; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Ensuring sustainability of the rivers and ecosystems requires coordinated and collaborative action on the part of all countries, with the long-term goal of synergising political, social, cultural and ecological facets associated with the riverine system. Daunting as this challenge is, evidence suggests that a long-term view of&#160;transboundary basins is not very optimistic as big rivers of Asia contribute heavily towards urban and agricultural activities, and are experiencing challenges of increasing sedimentation, large-scale damming and pollution, among others (Best, 2018). In the case of China, Sun et&#160;al. (2016) have shown that the localised vulnerabilities within the Yangtze River basin prompt an &#8216;integrated basin-wide approach&#8217; that is able to account for the specific needs of each of its sub-basins.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.12" top="126.68"><span x0="42.52" y0="126.68" x1="296.12" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 126.68; y1: 136.18; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In HMA, factors that undermine effective adaptation to climate change include both sudden-onset and slow-paced disasters along with the knowledge deficit regarding cryospheric change and its adverse impacts on water resources and also the agriculture and hydropower sectors. Other key barriers include a sectoral approach, overemphasis on structural approaches and the lack of context-sensitive, community-centric understanding of how these changes influence perceptions, </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.15" top="714.69"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.69" x1="560.15" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 309.2; y0: 714.69; y1: 724.19; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(Rasul et&#160;al., 2020; Hock et&#160;al., 2019).

Since the release of IPCC AR5, more studies have reinforced the earlier findings on the spatio-temporal diversity of climate-change impacts on food production in Asia depending on the geographic location, agroecology and crops grown (Hoegh-Guldberg et&#160;al., 2018; Ahmad et&#160;al., 2019), recognising that there are winners and losers associated with the changing climate across scales (Dasgupta et&#160;al., 2013a; Yong-Jian et&#160;al., 2013; Bobojonov and Aw-Hassan, 2014; Hijioka et&#160;al., 2014; Li et&#160;al., 2014a; Prabnakorn et&#160;al., 2018; Trisurat et&#160;al., 2018; Matsumoto, 2019).

Most of these impacts have been associated with drought, monsoon rain and oceanic oscillations, the frequency and severity of which have been linked with the changing climate (Heino et&#160;al., 2018; Heino et&#160;al., 2020). In general, major impacts to agricultural production, such as those observed by the farmers in the Philippines and Indonesia, include among others delays in crop harvesting, declining crop yields and quality of produce, increasing incidence of pests and diseases, stunted growth, livestock mortality and low farm income (Stevenson et&#160;al., 2013). In South Asia, the series of monsoon floods from 2005 to 2015 contributed to a high level of loss in agricultural production with peaks in 2008 and 2015 (FAO, 2018a). Similarly, in Pakistan, farmers are experiencing a decline in crop yields and increasing incidence of crop diseases as a result of climate extremes, particularly floods, droughts and heatwaves (Fahad and Wang, 2018; Ahmad et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.17" top="126.63"><span x0="306.57" y0="126.63" x1="560.17" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.43; y0: 126.63; y1: 136.13; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Limited studies have quantified the actual impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and the economy.
