<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As climate change, disasters, and other diverse crises continue to ravage natural resources, human settlements, inhabitants&#8217; livelihoods, and inhabitants and co-inhabitants&#8217; health and well-being, the three critical components developed from two social workers&#8217; critical reflections should be considered in order to enhance the three-level GSW interventions and promote individual and collective health and well-being. Based on the three crucial components developed above, in this section, the two authors will synthesize the GSW-specific essential capacities in order to advance GSW education, training, and practice through the three-level social work interventions. It is worth mentioning that these GSW-specific capacities shed light on developing related pedagogical approaches to engage climate change, disasters, and other crises-driven components in other health care and social care professional fields, promoting multidisciplinary multi-stakeholder engagement to advance resilience and sustainability.</p>
