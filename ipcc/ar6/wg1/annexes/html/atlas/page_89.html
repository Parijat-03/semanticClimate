These studies have demonstrated the added 2 value of regional climate models, particularly newly available runs in CORDEX through improved 3 summertime precipitation associated with the North American Monsoon (Tripathi and Dominguez, 2013; 4 Cerezo-Mota et al., 2015) as well as relative agreement between observations and the simulated 5 climatological wintertime storm tracks across the western United States. In comparison to previous sets of 6 RCMs in the NARCCAP, those in NA-CORDEX have better performance in simulating annual and semi-7 annual modes of precipitation variability in the North American Monsoon region and within the 8 intermountain west (Meyer et al., submitted).  9 10 Prein et al. (2019) investigated the ability of RCMs to capture large-scale weather types by examining NA-11 CORDEX and the WRF large perturbed-physics ensemble (WRF36). Twelve different hydrologically 12 relevant weather types were investigated. NA-CORDEX simulations were found to be more successful at 13 reproducing the weather types compared to the WRF36 ensemble, though it should be noted that there were a 14 number of differences in the suite of experiments that could account for this (e.g., size of domain).  15 16 However, a few deficiencies were reported. For example, excessive storm occurrence was found (Poan et al., 17 2018), and amplitude in the simulated annual cycle was generally excessive in both the lower and higher 18 resolution NA-CORDEX simulations. Summertime precipitation continued to show dry bias except for over 19 the Colorado Rockies) by low-resolution RCMs. An over-active monsoon was simulated by high-resolution 20 RCMs, presumably due to explicitly simulated mesoscale processes and thermodynamics driving the 21 convective precipitation. Additionally, a common trait of NA-CORDEX RCMs that outperformed the 22 ensemble average was the use of spectral nudging. Regional climate models also have been used to evaluate 23 extreme rainfall and temperature. In general, the annual cycle and spatial patterns of extreme temperature are 24 generally better than those of extreme precipitation (Whan and Zwiers, 2016; Meyer et al., submitted 25 submitted). 26 27 Recently, convective-permitting RCMs were used to simulate North American climate features and 28 generated better simulations. For example, summer precipitation over the south-western United States was 29 improved due to better representation of organized mesoscale convective systems at subdaily scale (Castro et 30 al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017a; Prein et al., 2017b; Pal et al., 2019) and the diurnal cycle convection (Nesbitt et 31 al., 2008). It has been suggested that the convective-permitting regional downscaling could perform better in 32 terms of mean and extremes for the north-eastern United States (Komurcu Bayraktar et al., 2018). 33 34 The lack of long-term high-quality high-resolution gridded datasets limits the assessment of model 35 performance for snow-related variables, especially at regional and local scales (Mccrary et al., 2017; Xu et 36 al., 2019b). Nevertheless, a few studies have focused on model bias estimation over specific regions, and 37 studies on future projections often include recent-past bias estimates. Model biases potentially have various 38 sources, like temperature biases, poor temperature-precipitation co-variability, and model 39 structural/parameter limitations in aspects relevant for snow dynamics (Rhoades et al., 2018). 40 41 For the NARCCAP regional simulations ensemble, McCrary and Mearns (2019) found that biases in snow-42 related variables are more sensitive to the RCM choice than to the driving GCM choice. Biases in winter 43 SWE are mostly positive, except for two models (WRFG and MM5I). Biases are markedly strong over the 44 western mountain chains, and the snow cover generally extends farther in the south than it does in 45 observational datasets. Continental-average snow cover extent and SWE values exceed observational 46 uncertainty in several simulations, for all cold months. NARCCAP snow cover duration biases show 47 different signs from one model to another, but a recurrent feature is a large positive bias over the western 48 US. Biases in snow cover duration occur at both ends of the cold season. 49 50 Biases in four NA-CORDEX models (RegCM4, CRCM5, CanRCM4 and WRF) over the California Sierra 51 Nevada were investigated by Xu et al. (2019), who found that all models overestimate snow ablation, and 52 that each of these RCMs has distinct biases regarding snow accumulation processes, compared to the 53 Landsat-Era Sierra Nevada Snow Reanalysis (SNSR) dataset. This study also suggests that increasing spatial 54 resolution (from 0.44&#176; to 0.11&#176; with CRCM5) leads to a substantial improvement in SWE, due to 55 </span></div></body></html>
