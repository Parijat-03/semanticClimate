Through a series of public colloquiums, the creation of blogs, and the development of innovative formats, visitors are invited to participate in conversations (and often debates) around topical issues such as global warming and the societal impact of emerging technologies. These strategies and approaches illustrate how science museums can potentially transform their spaces and practices to include deliberative forums where visitors can converse, participate, and engage in decision-making. Again, we hear echoes of Cameron&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1971</xref>) analysis that science museums must be more than temples.</p>
