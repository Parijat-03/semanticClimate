Participants frequently said they saw the change as a lightning bolt coming from nowhere. In a public interview, long-time activist Damaris Reyes said: &#8220;Right before the plan went into the city&#8217;s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), everything stopped. Everyone went quiet. And in September they came out with a totally different plan and everyone went crazy.&#8221; Activists and residents (and sociologists) could not peek into the black box of decision-making to observe precise moment that the plan changed. In the years since the change of plans, activists insisted on requesting the engineering documentation that justified the change of plans. City officials, until late 2020, responded that no single document explaining the changes existed, and instead resorted to justifying the change with presentations at public meetings.</p>
