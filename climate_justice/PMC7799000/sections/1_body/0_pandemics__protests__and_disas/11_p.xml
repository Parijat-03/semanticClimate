<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">I came at this from two directions; first, I'm a narratologist. I study how stories are built. And within that I study nonfiction or autobiographical stories. I hesitate to use the word <italic>autobiography</italic>, because I look at multimodal narrative acts of the self that occur in more spaces than the written space. When I returned to my classroom in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, I built a hurricane memoir project for students, but I made participation in it optional. Every student turned in a handwritten memoir that I read by candlelight. Those materials culminated in a student writing about how she had sat on her porch and watched her neighbors bury two family members in their backyard. They had died because there was still no electricity and the hospital was still closed.</p>
