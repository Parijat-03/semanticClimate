Soon after, the Reagan administration took direct aim at environmental regulations under a neoliberal mantra of free markets. These actions in turn prompted a swift backlash from the environmental movement (Brulle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>). Those opposed to environmental regulations learned an important lesson from this backlash; rather than directly attacking environmental programs, efforts should instead focus on undermining the science that supports such policies (Jacques et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2008</xref>; Michaels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2008</xref>). The conservative countermovement has constructed three primary narratives about climate change: (1) that it does not exist, (2) that if it does exist, it is not anthropogenic, and is possibly even desirable, and (3) that any efforts to mitigate climate change would harm the economy (Dunlap and McCright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2010</xref>).</p>
