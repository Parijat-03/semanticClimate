Additional factors like formal education and knowledge of traditional farming systems, secure tenure rights, access to electricity and social institutions in rice-farming areas of Bangladesh have played a positive role in reducing adaptation barriers (Alam 2015). A review of more than 168 publications over 15 years about adaptation of water resources for irrigation in Europe found the highest potential for action is in improving adaptive capacity and responding to changes in water demands, in conjunction with alterations in current water policy, farm extension training, and viable &#64257;nancial instruments (Iglesias and Garrote 2015). Research on the Great Barrier Reef, the Olifants River in Southern Africa, and &#64257;sheries in Europe, North America, and the Antarctic Ocean, suggests that the leading factor in harnessing the adaptive capacity of ecosystems is to reduce human stressors by enabling actors to collaborate across diverse interests, institutional settings, and sectors </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="735.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.36; y0: 735.55; y1: 745.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="735.55" x1="571.78">(Biggs et al. 2017; Schultz et al. 2015; Johnson and Becker 2015). Fostering equity and participation are correlated with the ef&#64257;cacy of local adaptation to secure food and livelihood security (Laube et al. 2012). In this chapter, we examine the literature surrounding appropriate policy instruments, decision-making, and governance practices to overcome limits and barriers to adaptation.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="651.56"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 651.56; y1: 661.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="651.56" x1="571.75">Incremental adaptation consists of actions where the central aim is to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given site, whereas transformational adaptation changes the fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate and its effects; the former is characterised as doing different things and the latter, doing things differently (Noble et al. 2014). Transformational adaptation is necessary in situations where there are hard limits to adaptation or it is desirable to address de&#64257;ciencies in sustainability, adaptation, inclusive development and social equity (Kates et al. 2012; Mapfumo et al. 2016). In other situations, incremental changes may be suf&#64257;cient (Hadarits et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="479.18" top="483.01"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.04; y0: 483.01; y1: 495.01; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="483.01" x1="479.18">Cross-Chapter Box 11 |  Gender in inclusive approaches to climate change, land and&#160;sustainable development</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.6" top="447.52"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.76; y0: 447.52; y1: 457.02; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="447.52" x1="557.6">Margot Hurlbert (Canada), Brigitte Baptiste (Colombia), Amber Fletcher (Canada), Marta Guadalupe Rivera Ferre (Spain), Darshini Mahadevia (India), Katharine Vincent (United Kingdom)</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.53" top="411.53"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 85.18; y0: 411.53; y1: 421.03; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="411.53" x1="557.53">Gender is a key axis of social inequality that intersects with other systems of power and marginalisation &#8211; including race, culture, class/socio-economic status, location, sexuality, and age &#8211; to cause unequal experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity. However, &#8216;policy frameworks and strong institutions that align development, equity objectives, and climate have the potential to deliver &#8220;triple-wins&#8221;&#8217; (Roy et al. 2018), including enhanced gender equality. Gender in relation to this report is introduced in Chapter 1, referred to as a leverage point in women&#8217;s participation in decisions relating to land deserti&#64257;cation (Section&#160;3.6.3), land degradation (Section&#160;4.1.6), food security (Section&#160;5.2.5.1), and enabling land and climate response options (Section&#160;6.1.2.2).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.56" top="327.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.42; y0: 327.54; y1: 337.04; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="327.54" x1="557.56">Focusing on &#8216;gender&#8217; as a relational and contextual construct can help avoid homogenising women as a uniformly and consistently vulnerable category (Arora-Jonsson 2011; Mersha and Van Laerhoven 2016; Ravera et al. 2016). There is high agreement that using a framework of intersectionality to integrate gender into climate change research helps to recognise overlapping and interconnected systems of power (Djoudi et al. 2016; Fletcher 2018; Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Moosa and Tuana 2014; Thompson-Hall et al. 2016), which create particular inequitable experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. Through this framework, both commonalities and differences may be found between the experiences of rural and urban women, or between women in high-income and low-income countries, for example. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.59" top="231.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 231.54; y1: 241.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="231.54" x1="557.59">In rural areas, women generally experience greater vulnerability than men, albeit through different pathways (Djoudi et al., 2016;&#160;Goh, 2012; Jost et al., 2016; Kakota, Nyariki, Mkwambisi, &amp; Kogi-Makau, 2011). In masculinised agricultural settings of&#160;Australia and Canada, for example, climate adaptation can increase women&#8217;s work on- and off-farm, but without increasing recognition for women&#8217;s undervalued contributions (Alston et al. 2018a; Fletcher and Knuttila 2016). A study in rural Ethiopia found&#160;that male-headed households had access to a wider set of adaptation measures than female-headed households (Mersha&#160;and&#160;Van&#160;Laerhoven&#160;2016). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.53" top="159.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 159.55; y1: 169.05; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="159.55" x1="557.53">Due to engrained patriarchal social structures and gendered ideologies, women may face multiple barriers to participation and decision-making in land-based adaptation and mitigation actions in response to climate change (high con&#64257;dence) (Alkire et al. 2013a; Quisumbing et al. 2014). These barriers include: (i) disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic work, including care-giving activities (Beuchelt and Badstue 2013) and provision of water and &#64257;rewood (UNEP, 2016); (ii) risk of violence in both public and private spheres, which restricts women&#8217;s mobility for capacity-building activities and productive work outside the home (Day et al., 2005; Jost et al., 2016; UNEP, 2016); (iii) less access to credit and &#64257;nancing (Jost et al. 2016); (iv) lack of organisational social capital, which may help in accessing credit (Carroll et al. 2012); (v) lack of ownership of productive assets and resources (Kristjanson et al., 2014;</span></div></body></html>
