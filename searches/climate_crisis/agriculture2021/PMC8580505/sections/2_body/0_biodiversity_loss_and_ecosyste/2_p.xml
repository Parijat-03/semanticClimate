Spillover events are affected by biological, ecological, and evolutionary characteristics of both pathogens and hosts, and by environmental factors.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the context of pathogen spillover to human populations, anthropogenic activities related to social, cultural, and economic human behaviour promote the human&#8211;animal interface, a suite of complex interactions between humans and other animals that frequently provide the opportunity for pathogens to cross the interspecific boundary.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
