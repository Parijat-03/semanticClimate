The PHRC consisted of discrete metrics in five main category areas: planetary health curriculum; interdisciplinary research in health and environment; university support for student planetary health initiatives; community outreach (centred on environmental health impacts); and medical school campus sustainability. For each metric, individual scores were provided, alongside a detailed explanation of collated evidence and suggested recommendations for improvement. Generation of both a QUB-specific report and the comparative report has helped facilitate dialogue within the School of Medicine, Dentistry &amp; Biomedical Science (SMDBS), its aligned research institutes, other schools within the university and the Student&#8217;s Union; promoting cross-institutional sharing of best practice and showcasing innovative forms of planetary health engagement. The report will also be used to help track progress over the coming years as the medical school provides greater resources, promotes research and facilitates discussion between staff and students to help advance the global planetary health movement.</p>
