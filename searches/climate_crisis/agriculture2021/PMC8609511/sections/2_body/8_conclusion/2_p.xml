The crisis triggered by the pandemic has severely affected India&#8217;s agricultural system. If we do not understand the impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural system, we will not be able to respond to the food security crisis. In India, mobility restrictions, transportation issues, and reverse labor migration have disrupted the domestic supply chain and ultimately pushed up the wholesale and retail prices of basic commodities such as soybeans, flour, milk, and vegetables. Buffering edible grains and crop discretion over previous crops limits the short-term impact, but if three-quarters of consumers report rising prices for basic commodities, that is not enough.</p>
