Environmental protection has been included in the career incentives of cadres alongside traditional growth targets (Wu and Cao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2021</xref>), while the State Council announced that &#8216;environmental targets would outweigh economic growth measures starting from 2017&#8217; (Li and Shapiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>, 59). Nevertheless, as China&#8217;s climate targets become more ambitious, the tension with other developmental imperatives is likely to persist. The topic of energy security is an example. While in the long term expanded domestic renewable energy is expected to improve China&#8217;s security of supply (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2019</xref>), in the short term, China has responded to energy security risks by ramping up coal capacity and oil and gas production (Meidan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2020</xref>; Tu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2020</xref>).</p>
