The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is responsible for urban planning and land management such as preparation of master plans and their implementation in coordination with other organizations. One of the main aims of these plans is to deal with the rapid population increase and its associated problems.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.32" top="627.87"><span x0="72.02" y0="627.87" x1="526.32" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 627.87; y1: 639.87; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Along with planning of new urbanization, the master plan also focuses on dealing with existing urban environments through various redevelopment strategies like conservation, rehabilitation and slum clearance. The current master plan of Delhi, the third one, covers the period from 2001 to 2021 and came into effect in 2007. The current master plan focuses on issues like promoting market competition in land and housing, encouraging tourism and increasing revenues. Despite the existence of several master plans and the authority given to the DDA to acquire the entire land within the city, a significant part of urbanization in Delhi has taken place in an unplanned way. This chapter mainly deals with the Land Use, Infrastructure and Solid Waste Management facilities of Delhi which constitute its Urban Planning. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="329.71" top="466.92"><span x0="72.02" y0="466.92" x1="329.71" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 466.92; y1: 478.92; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">14.1Existing Status of Urban Planning in Delhi </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.08" top="439.2"><span x0="72.02" y0="439.2" x1="526.08" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 439.2; y1: 451.2; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi&#8217;s urban population has grown from 1.4 million in 1951 to 16.3 million in 2011. In any urban area, population growth takes place through natural growth, net in-migration and expansion of physical boundary. The estimated annual population growth in Delhi showed that population growth by net in-migration is slightly more than the natural growth. For instance, average annual population growth by natural growth and net in-migration was 2.2% and 2.4% respectively between 1995 and 2006 (NCTD, 2009).  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.03" top="333.94"><span x0="72.02" y0="333.94" x1="526.03" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 333.94; y1: 345.94; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In spatial terms, the pattern of land use in Delhi was influenced considerably by the implementation of the Delhi Development Authority&#8217;s 20-year (1962&#8211;81) master plan. Broadly, public and semi-public land use was concentrated in the central secretariat area of New Delhi and in the old secretariat area in the civil lines, with subsidiary centres developing in the Indraprastha Estate (an office complex) in the east and in Ramakrishnapuram (an office-cum-residence complex) in the south. A large number of small manufacturing establishments have entrenched themselves in almost every part of old Delhi, but the main industrial areas have gravitated toward Najafgarh Road in the west and the large planned okhla industrial estate in the south.
