[<xref rid="B90-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] carried out a research using farmers of India&#8217;s Indo-Gangetic Plains. Major CSA practices by the farmers include diversifying crops, land levelling using laser, nutrient management in a site-specific mannerism, management of residue, and zero tillage, among others. The researchers started by calculating how much the farmers spent to adopt three most prominent CSA systems (variety of crops, land levelling using laser, and zero tillage). These values were estimated as +1402, +3037 and &#8211;1577 INR ha-1, respectively, for rice-wheat cultivation system. By improving their varieties in terms of crop production, the study results showed that the farmers of the Indo-Gangetic Plains can have their net return increase to up to INR 15,712 per-hectare, per-year. Similarly, when cultivating wheat and rice with no tillage, farmers could make up to INR 6951 per-hectare, per-year, and INR 8119 per-hectare, per-year with laser-based land levelling. Given the analyses of this results, it implies that integrating individual systems together would result in an even higher yield as well as income for the farmers. In econometric terms, adoption and execution of CSA practices for crop production in the north Indian River plain would significantly influence the cost of production, which decreased, but produced an increased yield of rice and wheat.</p>
