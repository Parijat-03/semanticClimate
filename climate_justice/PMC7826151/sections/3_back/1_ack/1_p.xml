We are grateful to graduate students Daniel Atkinson, Kristen Schaffer, and Zoya Padamski for their assistance with data collection and for their insights and enthusiasm. Thank you to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) grant #30124 and MITACS for funding our work and making this possible.
