<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0115">Much of the oil demand comes from the aviation industry. Typically, 99,700 flights flies per day worldwide, but this has been reduced to only one-fourth of the number to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. Air travel is responsible for 5.2% of the carbon emissions and 2.5% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Analysis of Flightradar24 data showed that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aircraft decreased by 31% (equivalent to 28 million tons). In the UK, Hong Kong, and Switzerland, air traffic has fallen by more than 90% since last year.</p>
