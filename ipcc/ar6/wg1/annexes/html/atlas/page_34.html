Although there has been an 9 improvement in the simulation of mean states, interannual variability, and past climate changes in the 10 progression from CMIP3 to CMIP5, some previously documented biases (such as the ridge position of the 11 western North Pacific subtropical high and the associated rainfall bias) are still evident in CMIP5 models 12 (Zhou et al., 2017a). Some CMIP6 models show improvements in simulating the mean precipitation and 13 interannual variation, but the deficiencies are still evident (Sellar et al.; Tatebe et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). 14 The performance of models is sensitive to cumulus convection schemes and horizontal resolution (Haarsma 15 et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017; Kusunoki, 2018b). The high-resolution AGCM is successful in reproducing the 16 intensity and the spatial pattern of the EASM rainfall (Li et al., 2015a; Yao et al., 2017) and improves the 17 simulation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation rates and the probability density distributions of daily 18 precipitation over Korea, Japan and northern China (Lin et al., 2019).  19 20 Recent studies using CORDEX-EA models showed that the RCMs produce relatively more detailed regional 21 features of the temperature distribution compared with the driving GCMs (Tang et al., 2016). But RCMs also 22 show large biases in simulating East Asian climatology and variability (Park et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; 23 Zou and Zhou, 2016), and do not always show added value compared to the driving GCMs (Li et al., 2018a). 24 For example, by comparing inter-GCM and inter-RCM differences around the Japan archipelago, it was 25 found that RCMs bring about a relatively large difference in precipitation (Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018). The 26 multi-model ensemble (MME) overall produces superior simulation compared with a single RCM (Huang et 27 al., 2015; Jin et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2018a).  28 29 Topography has a strong effect on the precipitation patterns over East Asia, and the simulation of 30 precipitation over regions with complicated topography is a major challenge. Over the Tibetan Plateau, 31 RCMs consistently show similar spatial patterns, but there is a mean cold (wet) bias in the temperature 32 (precipitation) climatology compared to station observations (Guo et al., 2018a). Over steep mountains such 33 as the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, the overestimation of heavy rainfall is found to be caused by the 34 &#8220;overshoot&#8221; of water vapor to the high-altitude region of the windward slopes (Yu et al., 2015). 35 36 Evaluation of the ability of CORDEX-EA models in simulating tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the 37 western North Pacific indicates that models reasonably capture the observed climatological spatial 38 distribution and interannual variability of TC activity. But due to the low horizontal resolutions (~50 km), 39 RCMs tend to underestimate TC intensity (Jin et al., 2016).  40 41 42 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 240.47; y1: 251.45; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="240.47" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.3.1.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="240.47" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 240.47; y1: 251.45; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">43 Coupled model simulations indicate that East Asia will experience ~0.2&#176;C higher warming than the global 44 mean conditions in the 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C warming conditions at the end of the 21st century. Larger warming 45 magnitudes are projected to occur in the southern, north-western, and north-eastern regions of China, parts of 46 Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan than in other regions (Li et al., 2018b). The increases in the 47 monthly minimum values of daily minimum temperature (TNn) and maximum values of daily maximum 48 temperature (TXx) over mainland China tend to show a similar spatial pattern during the period 2070&#8211;2099 49 (relative to the baseline 1961&#8211;1990) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The largest increases in TNn 50 (more than 5 &#176;C in RCP4.5 and 8 &#176;C in RCP8.5) are projected to occur mainly in northeast China and most 51 parts of western China (Xu et al., 2019a). 52 53 Figure Atlas.25:c,e show the projected temperature changes under CMIP5 RCP85 and CMIP6 SSP5-85. 54 Both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show uniform warming in East Asia.
