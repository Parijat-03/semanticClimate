As illustrated above, those whose health is at risk are often the same climate-vulnerable communities who are most likely to be subject to human rights violations; we argue that adopting a HRBA and a health lens to climate action can thus lead to more just and cost-effective solutions aiming at addressing the climate resilience of the most impacted and vulnerable groups among and within societies, including children and young people. As illustrated by the IPCC, adopting such an intersectoral approach, which recognizes the systemic discrimination that vulnerable communities face, due to their age, gender, ethnicity, disability, income, and socioeconomic status among others, with a human rights and health lens to tackle the climate crisis, will lead to more ambitious, comprehensive, and cost-effective interventions to increase climate resilience and action [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
