Contemporary legal practice has not enabled effective adaptation in part because SLR affects compensable property rights that are secured by the law, and which generally trump concerns about public safety, resilience and sustainability (Reiblich et&#160;al., 2019). Private property rights can be used as both a sword and a shield to privilege dominant interests by undermining land use policies, plans and implementation efforts intended to promote integrated coastal management and risk reduction (O&#8217;Donnell et&#160;al., 2019; Reiblich et&#160;al., 2019). Climate change litigation has proliferated over the past decade (Setzer and Vanhala, 2019), addressing, among other things, failures to prepare for or adapt to climate change, and to secure human rights (Peel and Osofsky, 2018).
