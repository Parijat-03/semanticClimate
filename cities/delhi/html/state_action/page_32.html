Delhi&#8217;s Disaster Management Authority has prepared disaster preparedness and mitigation plan which attempts to protect the lives and properties of the people of Delhi from potentially devastating hazards by the implementation of an effective long term Delhi Disaster Management Policy. The initiatives under this plan lay down certain objectives and suggest definitive strategies leading to the achievement of goals in a set time frame. The ultimate goal for the GNCTD with respect to various hazards is to have prepared communities in a way that when the hazards strike, there is little or no loss of life; least number of injuries and the losses to property and infrastructure are not critical. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="286.73" top="595.35"><span x0="72.02" y0="595.35" x1="286.73" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 595.35; y1: 607.35; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">4.2Possible Future Climate Scenarios </span></div><div left="72.02" right="395.18" top="567.72"><span x0="72.02" y0="567.72" x1="395.18" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 567.72; y1: 579.72; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Observational studies over India have shown warming of about 0.5</span><span x0="395.59" y0="573.13" x1="399.61" style="x0: 395.59; x1: 399.61; y0: 573.13; y1: 581.17; width: 4.02; font-size: 8.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">o</span><span x0="399.55" y0="567.72" x1="508.28" style="x0: 399.55; x1: 407.55; y0: 567.72; y1: 579.72; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">C per 100 years on an all India average basis though pockets of higher values and even cooling exist over different parts of India. Future projections of climate change using global and regional climate models, run by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) with different IPCC emission scenarios, indicate temperature changes of about 3 &#8211; 5&#176;C and increase of about 5-10% in summer monsoon rainfall. It is also projected that number of rainy days may decrease by 20 to 30% which would mean that the intensity of rainfall is expected to increase. Extremes in temperature and rainfall also show increase in their frequency and intensity by the end of the year 2100. As per the assessment of IITM, in the daily rainfall for over 50 years show similar trends in extreme rainfall. Crop models run with such scenarios also show fall in food production per acre in India by about 20%. Further hydrological models show fall in India's water resources which when combined with the recession of Himalayan glacier would pose a serious threat to the food and water security of the rising population of India. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="204.65" top="327.22"><span x0="72.02" y0="327.22" x1="204.65" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.02; y0: 327.22; y1: 339.22; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">4.3Model Projections </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.06" top="299.62"><span x0="72.02" y0="299.62" x1="508.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 299.62; y1: 311.62; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">High resolution climate change scenarios for Indian, generated by PRECIS indicate a rise in annual mean surface air temperature for all parts of India.
