It is proposed to select Research Institutions and universities and train on methods and approaches on monitoring mitigation and adaptation projections. Line departments have their inbuilt monitoring mechanism which may take care of monitoring and evaluation once trained. M&amp;E would enable appropriate short-term and mid-term changes to the identified adaptation and mitigation strategies, correcting past mistakes and improving practices. Monitoring indicators, in the nature of output or outcome, have been selected and listed for each of the interventions, in the SAPCC. Monitoring frequency appropriate to each of the monitoring indicators, in so far as the SAPCC is concerned, has also been suggested. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.74" top="378.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="378.43" x1="507.74" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 378.43; y1: 389.47; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Towards the end of the report, annexure includes the list of working groups along with the details of respective Chairperson, Conveners and members; Highlights of the meeting held with the MoEF&amp;CC to take inputs of the Government of India on the Delhi SAPCC; and Working Groups meeting minutes.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.18" top="310.27"><span x0="72.02" y0="310.27" x1="508.18" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 310.27; y1: 321.31; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The SAPCC is a dynamic and flexible policy framework which will follow a continuous and interactive process to reflect the changes and developments happening at the national, State and local levels.

The Delhi SAPCC has been designed following stakeholders concerns and issues. The SAPCC has followed a structured approach to formulate and implement adaptation strategies, policies and measures to ensure human development in the face of climate variability and change. The implementation of Delhi SAPCC will be based on the strong stakeholder engagement and capacity development at all levels of the society to enable better acceptance and implementation of CC mitigation and adaptation measures.  </span></div></body></html>
