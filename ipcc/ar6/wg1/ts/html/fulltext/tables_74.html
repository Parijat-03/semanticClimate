      <td>The present rates of response of many aspects of the climate system are proportionate to the rate of recent temperature\nchange, but some aspects may respond disproportionately. Some climate system components are slow to respond,\nsuch as the deep ocean overturning circulation and the ice sheets (Box TS.4). It is virtually certain that irreversible,\ncommitted change is already underway for the slow-to-respond processes as they come into adjustment for past and\npresent emissions.\nThe paleoclimate record indicates that tipping elements exist in the climate system where processes undergo sudden\nshifts toward a different sensitivity to forcing, such as during a major deglaciation, where 1&#176;C degree of temperature\nchange might correspond to a large or small ice-sheet mass loss during different stages (Box TS.2). For global climate\nindicators, evidence for abrupt change is limited, but deep ocean warming, acidification and sea level rise are committed\nto ongoing change for millennia after global surface temperatures initially stabilize and are irreversible on human time\nscales (very high confidence). At the regional scale, abrupt responses, tipping points and even reversals in the direction of\nchange cannot be excluded (high confidence). Some regional abrupt changes and tipping points could have severe local\nimpacts, such as unprecedented weather, extreme temperatures and increased frequency of droughts and forest fires.\nModels that exhibit such tipping points are characterized by abrupt changes once the threshold is crossed, and even\na return to pre-threshold surface temperatures or to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations does not guarantee\nthat the tipping elements return to their pre-threshold state. Monitoring and early warning systems are being put into\nplace to observe tipping elements in the climate system. {1.3, 1.4.4, 1.5, 4.3.2, Table 4.10, 5.3.4, 5.4.9, 7.5.3, 9.2.2,\n9.2.4, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.6.3, Cross-chapter Box 12.1}</td>

      <td>Understanding of multi-decadal reversibility (i.e., the system returns to the previous climate state within multiple decades after\nthe radiative forcing is removed) has improved since AR5 for many atmospheric, land surface and sea ice climate metrics following\nsea surface temperature recovery. Some processes suspected of having tipping points, such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation (AMOC), have been found to often undergo recovery after temperature stabilization with a time delay (low confidence).\nHowever, substantial irreversibility is further substantiated for some cryosphere changes, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean\nacidification. {4.7.2, 5.3.3, 5.4.9, 9.2.2, 9.2.4, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.6.3}</td>

      <td>Some climate system components are slow to respond, such as the deep ocean overturning circulation and the ice sheets. It is likely that\nunder stabilization of global warming at 1.5&#176;C, 2.0&#176;C or 3.0&#176;C relative to 1850&#8211;1900, the AMOC will continue to weaken for several\ndecades by about 15%, 20% and 30% of its strength and then recover to pre-decline values over several centuries (medium confidence).\nAt sustained warming levels between 2&#176;C and 3&#176;C, there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost\nalmost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; both the probability of their complete loss and the rate of mass loss increases\nwith higher surface temperatures (high confidence). At sustained warming levels between 3&#176;C and 5&#176;C, near-complete loss of the\nGreenland Ice Sheet and complete loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to occur irreversibly over multiple millennia (medium\nconfidence); with substantial parts or all of Wilkes Subglacial Basin in East Antarctica lost over multiple millennia (low confidence). Early-\nwarning signals of accelerated sea level rise from Antarctica could possibly be observed within the next few decades. For other hazards\n(e.g., ice-sheet behaviour, glacier mass loss and global mean sea level change, coastal floods, coastal erosion, air pollution, and ocean\nacidification) the time and/or scenario dimensions remain critical, and a simple and robust relationship with global warming level cannot\nbe established (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.7.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.5, 5.4.8, 8.6, 9.2, 9.4, Box 9.3, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1}</td>

      <td>For global climate indicators, evidence for abrupt change is limited. For global warming up to 2&#176;C above 1850&#8211;1900 levels, paleoclimate\nrecords do not indicate abrupt changes in the carbon cycle (low confidence). Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty\nin atmospheric CO by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than uncertainties related to carbon&#8211;climate\n2\nfeedbacks (high confidence). There is no evidence of abrupt change in climate projections of global temperature for the next century:\nthere is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO emissions and maximum global mean surface air temperature increase\n2\ncaused by CO over the course of this century for global warming levels up to at least 2&#176;C relative to 1850&#8211;1900. The increase in global\n2\nocean heat content (Section TS.2.4) will likely continue until at least 2300 even for low emissions scenarios, and global mean sea level\nwill continue to rise for centuries to millennia following cessation of emissions (Box TS.4) due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake\nand mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (high confidence). {2.2.3; Cross-Chapter Box 2.1; 5.1.1; 5.4; Cross-Chapter\nBox 5.1; Figures 5.3, 5.4, 5.25, and 5.26; 9.2.2; 9.2.4}</td>
