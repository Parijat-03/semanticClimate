<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Changing the global climate of land politics is key, and it is urgent. Without it, any analyses of and responses to climate change are at best superficial, and at worst, flawed and self-defeating &#8211; and are likely to only add to the growing list of what Gills and Morgan (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) call &#8216;successful failures&#8217;. But this does not imply changing the global climate of land politics in a random way. Rather, it calls for a very specific character and direction of change: to acknowledge the pervasive land-based social inequities in the world today, and to take a position to end such inequalities by pursuing an egalitarian distribution of a range of access to a range of land and resources that explicitly benefits the working people that, in turn and ultimately, can only be made possible through structural transformation.</p>
