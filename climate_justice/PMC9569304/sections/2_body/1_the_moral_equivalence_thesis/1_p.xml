They both have well-developed mental, moral, and cognitive capacities. Both can be considered moral agents and can be attributed moral responsibility for the decisions they make. Ann enjoys her affluent lifestyle and rejects the option of being a procreator: she does not have children and has opted to be sterilized to make sure she will never become pregnant. Pearl, on the other hand, is a procreator: she has two children and has not yet decided whether or not to have more. Given what we know about the negative impact of procreation on issues of ecological sustainability, this implies that with the same consumption pattern, Pearl&#8217;s impact on the ecosystem will be significantly larger than Ann&#8217;s. The question is whether Ann should be morally permitted to increase her impact on the ecosystem by changing her material lifestyle up to the level she would have had if she also had two children. For example, Ann could fly on a more regular basis, eat more dairy, build a heated swimming pool in her house, or indulge in other forms of overconsumption. What should we think of Ann&#8217;s claim that she is entitled to have the same level of impact on the ecosystem as Pearl and others who voluntarily have children?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> We can formulate this question differently: if we determine each person&#8217;s fair emissions quota, should procreators receive extra emission rights to cover the emissions needed to procreate and raise children, or should procreators instead use their own emission rights to cover the emissions of their offspring?</p>
