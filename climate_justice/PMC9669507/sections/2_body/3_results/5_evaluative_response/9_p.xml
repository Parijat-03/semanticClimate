executive branch of the government was criticized for its poor leadership and
inaction in response to the virus, a commenter wrote &#8220;Yet the schools are still
open. Just the kind of leadership and vision that we&#8217;ve come to expect.&#8221; The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was also criticized after it
decides to revoke the masking rules for vaccinated individuals as stated in one
of the comments: &#8220;CDC says no masking needed for the vaccinated. what a joke?!
this is what you get when everything is politicalized in US.&#8221; Commenters also
criticized a segment of the public for disregarding the dangers of spreading the
virus during travel. One commenter expressed the problem by criticizing &#8220;the
people who are infected while traveling are ignoring the fact that they are
spreading the disease by returning home.&#8221; Furthermore, some commenters were
critical of people in society dismissing the information presented in the
models, &#8220;It makes me nuts reading people dismiss the models as irrelevant simply
because they are imperfect&#8221;&#8212;one commenter wrote.</p>
