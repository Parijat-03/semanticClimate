In doing both, our priorities could shift toward critical research, education, and policy changes with a focus on uplifting the needs and concerns of those most vulnerable to the disruptions and inequities in the food system. This would also demand a redistribution of resources and decision-making power to communities most impacted by the historical and hegemonic race-gender-class politics of food access and availability. In this effort, it will prove crucial that those who benefit from pervasive systems of privilege (especially White privilege) to listen to and act in solidarity with civil society movements in the Global South and Global North who are actively re-imagining land, food, and environmental justice and liberation through such frameworks as agroecology, food sovereignty, and collective agency (see Agyeman and Alkon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Daigle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>; Holt Gim&#233;nez et al. 2017; Penniman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>; White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). It is in this vein that Anderson&#8217;s Presidential Address sharpens our awareness of a groundswell of academic and grassroot activism currently addressing the social, economic, and ecological un-sustainability of the globalized food system.</p>
