<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0210">Contrasting values and notions of care underpinning the &#8216;necessity&#8217; defense were then ushered forward on December 3rd, when cases were heard of a 73-year old retired lawyer (eventually handed a 28-day sentence) and a retired high school science teacher, whose affidavit noted that her actions were a response to the monstrous failure of the Canadian political system to prioritize the climate emergency. A robust legal defence was presented with two key arguments: first, that these proceedings were an <italic>abuse of process</italic>, and second, that the defendants' actions <italic>more than meet the evidentiary requirements for a &#8220;necessity defence.&#8221;</italic> For the latter, only the &#8220;air of reality&#8221; has to be met to advance this argument to trial. The defence provided a Detailed Outline of Proposed Evidence, including science on greenhouse gases and lists of famous scientists ready to testify. Nonetheless, a senior Crown prosecutor &#8211; brought in specially to rebut necessity defence arguments &#8211; argued that a &#8220;reasonable alternative&#8221; could be &#8220;to not act at all&#8221; in the face of climate concerns or to employ &#8220;alternative&#8221; actions such as writing to Parliament, as if they were not already exhausted, and that the necessity case should be &#8220;summarily dismissed&#8221; as a situation &#8220;where the future harm is not probable.&#8221; To nobody's surprise, the judge sided with the prosecution; but his wording and the swiftness of his response was startling: he did this within seconds of the conclusion of preliminary arguments and memorably stated that while dire consequences of climate change may be foreseeable or likely, they are not yet a &#8220;virtual certainty.&#8221;</p>
