These factors of the pandemic, global warming, and energy-mix are able to be related to each other in the analysis. The simulations are performed by the modeling which has the quantifications of energy-mix study as mitigations, pandemic, and global-warming. Carbon neutrality is connected to global warming via energy-mix and mitigations. In the case of mitigations, energy-mix case oscillated much higher than the non-energy-mix case. In the case of global warming, the relative impact value is higher in the non-energy-mix case. So, global warming is mitigated when the energy-mix is performed. In figure, the 9.875th year has the biggest difference between the two cases when the energy-mix has the highest effect on the global warming aspect. After this pandemic, the leverage of carbon neutrality could be made.</p></abstract>
