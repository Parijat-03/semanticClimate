If a parcel had $0 flood damage or depths below 20&#8201;cm in a given counterfactual scenario but had flood damages or depths in the baseline (actual) scenario, then the parcel was assigned a value of 1 to denote that it flooded only because of the presence of climate change-attributed precipitation. Cases that did not flood at all were coded as 0, and cases that would have flooded regardless of climate change-attributed flood depths or damages are assigned as &#8220;anyway flooded&#8221; and are excluded from the analysis that focuses only on parcels that would not have flooded without climate change.</p>
