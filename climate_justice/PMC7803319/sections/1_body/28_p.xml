Most of his criticism was in the form of articles that spread worldwide through the media and the Internet. His campaign was particularly successful at the 2014 UN Climate Summit in New York when his environmental organization '350.org.' along with 1,500 other international organizations marched in New York as a protest against the negligence of world leaders [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This initiative can be seen as a core movement triggered by a specific action and campaign, which continues to engage a multitude of people around the world, giving them guidance on how to organize their own campaigns using soft power tools. </p>
