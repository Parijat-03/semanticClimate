In the celebrated <italic>Oposa v Factorian</italic>, the Supreme Court granted a petition by a group of minors and instructed the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources to refrain from accepting, approving, or renewing timber license agreements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In terms of IE, the Court observed that the class suit of the children, on the one hand, is to safeguard their right to a sound environment, and on the other hand, ensure the promotion of that right for the generations yet unborn. It concluded that whereas the right to a healthful environment is not under the Bill of Rights, it &#8216;concerns nothing less than self-preservation and self-perpetuation, the advancement of which may even be said to predate all governments and constitutions&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The judgment of the Court speaks directly to the rights of children, who are disproportionately impacted by the risks of a rapidly changing climate. This influential and powerful exposition of intergenerational rights in the <italic>Oposa</italic> case resonated in the judgment of the <italic>Philippi Horticultural</italic> case, where the High Court in South Africa held that development ought to be environmentally sustained for the benefit of present and future generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To this end, the universally ratified Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on the Rights of the Child could be leveraged to advance IE and intergenerational climate justice.</p>
