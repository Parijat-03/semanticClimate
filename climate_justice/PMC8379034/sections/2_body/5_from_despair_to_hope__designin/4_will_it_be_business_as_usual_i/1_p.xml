Perhaps more than any other international negotiation process leading up to the early 1990s, the UNCED process allowed the international community to imagine a world in which governments can come together to work toward a collaborative path toward long-term sustainability. What was a contentious debate then and one continues to persist to this day centered on the core question of how to finance this global vision of sustainable development (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). Should the industrialized countries pay for the costs of additional measures undertaken by developing countries to tackle global environmental problems? This notion of &#8220;additionality,&#8221; that is financial commitments beyond existing development assistance, &#8220;became a rallying cry for the developing countries in the negotiations on Agenda 21 prior to the Earth Summit, and something that has been raised many times since: a desire for a sustainable future is rarely followed up with adequate institutional support and economic resources&#8221; (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>, p. 4).</p>
