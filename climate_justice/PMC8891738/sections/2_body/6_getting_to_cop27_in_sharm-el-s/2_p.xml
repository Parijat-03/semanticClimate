The next two COPs are taking place in the Midde East and North Africa (MENA) region. It allows and obliges MENA youth to take the center stage. Children and young people (0&#8211;24&#160;year old) currently account for nearly half of the region&#8217;s population and hold significant potential to bring about change. The MENA region, however suffers from world&#8217;s lowest level of youth civic engagement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn24">24</xref> Taking the lead in clean energy transition and achieveing the Paris Agreement offers multiple opportunities for young men, and women in particular, to reach their full potential by reaping the beneftis of aquiring new future-proof skills and taking advantage of the enabling environment of the just transition that aims to leave no one behind. New jobs created by renewables are an answer for the highest in the world youth unemployment. It only shows that young women and men in MENA region have a great deal to gain and therefore an incentive to get involved.</p>
