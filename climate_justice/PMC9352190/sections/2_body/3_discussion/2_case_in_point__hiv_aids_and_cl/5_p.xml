<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0023">Another important task is to establish the baseline vulnerability to climate change of communities affected by HIV/AIDS. Part of this baseline is having a clear assessment of the scope of HIV/AIDS nationally and extrapolating how climate change can worsen this situation in the coming years. UNAIDS estimates that in the Philippines, only 67% of PLHIVs know their status, 55% have CD4 count lower than 200 cells/&#956;L at the time of diagnosis, 32% are on ART, and 82% remain on ART 12 months after treatment initiation <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite numerous efforts in recent years especially by civil society, HIV testing is still limited in the Philippines. One study showed that the prevalence of HIV testing among Filipino women aged 15&#8211;49 is only 2.4% <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246013" id="interref0008">[</ext-link>
<xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Low testing rate means more PLHIVs - who can be potentially affected by climate change's impacts - are not being diagnosed and provided care. Future climate catastrophes can further restrict access to limited testing and hamper case detection efforts.</p>
