the strategic role that education assumes in social movements for facilitating
the transfer and expansion of knowledges over generations, as well as across
territories. In the Uruguayan Federation of Mutual Aid Housing Cooperatives
(FUCVAM), intergenerational learning has been a strong pillar of its work as a
movement. This, on the one hand, concerns the everyday learning through which
young people living in cooperatives acquire values of mutual care and
solidarity, as well as consciousness of the wider political project within which
they are growing up. As Ignacio Lostorto, a young adult in FUCVAM&#8217;s cooperative

productive way to advance, and it is the way that promotes values such as
conviviality and which gives you tranquillity with yourself and with
others&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn32-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">32</xref>)</sup></p>
