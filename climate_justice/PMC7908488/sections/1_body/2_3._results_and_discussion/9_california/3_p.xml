<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Black neighborhoods in California&#8217;s urban regions experienced only slightly greater temperature disparities than in other Southwestern locations. On average heat days, California&#8217;s top-decile Black neighborhoods were 0.9 &#176;C (1.6 &#176;F) warmer than their lowest-decile counterparts, while the average disparity in other Southwestern metro areas was 0.5 &#176;C (0.8 &#176;F). On extreme heat days, both groups&#8217; disparities were just under 1.1 &#176;C (2 &#176;F).</p>
