<bold>P<sc>Eter</sc> L<sc>Iebhold</sc>:</bold> I am a curator at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History (<sc>Nmah</sc>), where we have over sixty curators. There is unquestionably a large effort by quite a few curators to collect around the COVID-19 pandemic. We all see this as a disruption that is likely to cause real change in the ability to collect artifacts related to the time. I think all of us at the <sc>Nmah</sc> look back at 1918 and realize that nobody collected much of anything, and we're much poorer because of that. So, I hope we can do better this time around.</p>
