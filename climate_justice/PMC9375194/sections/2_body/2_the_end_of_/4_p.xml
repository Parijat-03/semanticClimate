If we needed any evidence that we, too, are another biological life form, subject to the evolutionary process, the emergence of COVID-19 is a stark reminder. We are another life form, far more interconnected with and interdependent on all other life forms, both plant and animal, than we sometimes realize, even if certain religious and theological frames of reference encourage us to think otherwise. In our unrelenting quest to have dominion over all the earth, nothing less than a divine mandate according to Genesis, we see ourselves as more <italic>independent of</italic> and separate from other life forms, more distinct and exceptional. But the consequences of taking &#8220;have dominion&#8221; to the extreme are now becoming all too apparent, as the biological annihilation via human activity, which has triggered a major extinction event, comes into full view.</p>
