<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">Poverty trap is understood differently across disciplines.</p>
<p>In the social sciences, the concept, primarily employed at the individual, household or community level, describes a situation in which escaping poverty becomes impossible due to unproductive or inflexible resources. A poverty trap can also be seen as a critical minimum asset threshold, below which families are unable to successfully educate their children, build up their productive assets and get out of poverty. Extreme poverty is itself a poverty trap since poor persons lack the means to participate meaningfully in society. In economics, the term poverty trap is often used at national scales, referring to a self-perpetuating condition where an economy, caught in a vicious cycle, suffers from persistent underdevelopment (Matsuyama, 2008). Many proposed models of poverty traps are found in the literature.</p>
