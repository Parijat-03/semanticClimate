A large number of U.S. states have adopted renewable portfolio standards (RPS) which obligate utilities to source a share of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. There is literature debating the extent to which RPS drives wind installed capacity [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261752.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In terms of mechanisms, scholars note that the RPS might depend on wind energy potential [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Tribal nations do not mandate RPS. Typically, they are connected with the state grid, which could drive demand for wind energy generation on tribal lands. But sometimes, the state grid itself is connected to a regional grid which means that a tribal wind turbine could provide renewable electricity to the state, which is not contiguous to the tribal land. Recognizing the diversity in RPS design [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we rated state RPS according to two features of the standard: the maximum level of zero-emissions energy mandated and the number of years after 2000 before the level must be achieved. New York, with a requirement for 100% zero-emissions energy by 2040, received a score of 2.5. States with no RPS received a score of zero. The data are from the National Conference of State Legislators [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
