<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Notably, we see here how <italic toggle="yes">customers</italic> are still implicitly construed as Beneficiaries and Recipients, either through the use of potentials (<italic toggle="yes">can</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">have been able to</italic>) or through the positioning of the store and its facilities as the enabling actor in these constructions (<italic toggle="yes">in our conveniently located collection units at the front of the store</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">to the new &#8216;drop and shop&#8217; donation point</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">in a machine at the store entrance</italic>). These examples also represent another trend in the customers-as-Agents data, which is that the active processes they are engaging in are often related to charity (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">donate</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">support</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">vote for</italic>) or consumption (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">buy</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">purchase</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">shop</italic>).</p>
