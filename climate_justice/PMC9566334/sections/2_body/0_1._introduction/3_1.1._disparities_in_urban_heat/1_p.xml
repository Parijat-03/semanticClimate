Harlan et al., observed in 2007 that affluent predominantly White communities were more likely to live in vegetated and less climatically stressed neighborhoods than those in poor Latino communities within Phoenix, AZ, U.S. [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a study focusing on Richmond, VA, U.S., Saverino et al., found census block level areas occupied by people of lower SES and/or those historically marginalized disproportionately experienced higher temperatures and higher impacts on health [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mitchell and Chakraborty observed that census tracts with higher percentages of people of color and higher percentages of those in poverty had significantly higher temperatures than predominantly White census tracts in Pinellas County, FL, U.S. [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a separate study focusing on the three largest U.S. cities (New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago) they also found significant bivariate statistical associations between lower SES, historical marginalization and urban heat risk [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
