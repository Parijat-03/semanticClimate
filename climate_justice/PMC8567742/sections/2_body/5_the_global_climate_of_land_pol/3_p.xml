<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The principal narrative animating the global political acts of roll back, contain, block and promote is the notion that the key to addressing the economic and climate crises is to take land and nature from their current <italic toggle="yes">economically inefficient</italic> use by their economically inefficient users. The assumption is that land, when used efficiently by efficient users, can function maximally as production input and as waste sink. The push for the twin policies of deregulated markets and private property in land has been uneven across societies and over time, in part because of varying degrees of resistance to it (Deininger, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; World Bank, <xref rid="CIT0109" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Despite such political contestations, neoliberal forces have managed to bring the world to its current state of land politics.</p>
