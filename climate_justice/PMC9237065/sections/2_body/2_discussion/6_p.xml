Our aim is to provide a framework for distributing future emissions budgets based on well-established equity principles, but it must be emphasized that contextual factors, the choice of interpretations, and their implementation can lead to differing outcomes. Numerous potential proxies could be suggested for a given interpretation (see Supplementary Information section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for discussion on possible governance indicators). Application of increasing renewable shares, as either a responsibility or capability interpretation, is an apt example; valid arguments can be made to place it under either equity consideration, but arguments against are also relevant. Implementation of an RES-based capability interpretation is problematic as it can be seen to reward countries for a lack of past effort without encouraging lagging countries to act by increasing their reductions. Also, past performance regarding RES is not a reliable indicator of future performance, as political or economic conditions may lead to changing capability. For a further discussion on the ambiguity of renewables as an equity interpretation, see the Supplementary Information, section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p>
