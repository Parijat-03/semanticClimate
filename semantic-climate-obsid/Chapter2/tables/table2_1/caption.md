Table 2.1 Total anthropogenic GHG emissions (GtCO2eq yr-1) 1990-2019

CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI); CO2 from Land Use, Land Use Change 28 and Forestry (LULUCF); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, 29 SF6, NF3). Aggregate GHG emission trends by groups of gases reported in Gt CO2eq converted based on 30 global warming potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment 31 Report. Uncertainties are reported for a 90% confidence interval.
