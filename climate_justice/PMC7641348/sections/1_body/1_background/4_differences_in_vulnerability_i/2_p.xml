California&#8217;s Fourth Climate Change Assessment Climate Justice Report touched on the limitations of CES in its analysis, comparing it to the Healthy Places Index [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. CEJA released a report focused on the use of CES in various environmental justice projects throughout the state, highlighting recommended uses of CES in policy making and implementation decisions [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, an EPA-sponsored Regionally Applied Research Effort project used multiple environmental justice screening indices and ground-truthing methods to develop a regional understanding of cumulative pollution exposure in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study fortifies and expands on these projects. Furthermore, we aim to assist in the development of &#8220;more robust mapping tools,&#8221; an identified knowledge gap, by strengthening knowledge of potential impacts and biases that could result from using vulnerability indices in policy development and climate adaptation decision making [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
