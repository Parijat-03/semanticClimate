Citizenship School in Brazil provoked unanticipated pathways and practices of
learning, as its pedagogies started to reverberate from curated online sessions
to social media channels like Instagram (see <xref rid="fig4-09562478221115334" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). There, stories and
observations from the virtual classroom were shared and further debated, while
new conversations led to thousands of new followers. Engagement with the
activating effects of social media and their political power, for example,
through proactive engagement with &#8220;influencers&#8221;, has since become a strategic
leveraging practice for the pedagogues running the school.</p>
