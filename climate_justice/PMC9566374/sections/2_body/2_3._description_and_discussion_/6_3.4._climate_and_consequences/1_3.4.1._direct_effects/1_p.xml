One of the most important is the increase in the earth&#8217;s surface temperature. In a scenario of insufficient policy action to turn around GHG emissions and in which CO<sub>2</sub> emissions almost double by 2050 (Shared Socio-Economic Pathway SSP3-7.0), it is very likely that the mean temperature of the earth&#8217;s surface at the end of the 21st century (2081&#8211;2100) will be about 3.6 &#176;C higher, compared to the period 1850&#8211;1900 [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is also highly probable that there will be an increase in several extreme phenomena that may vary depending on the location, such as: (1) frequent high daytime and night-time temperatures; (2) frequency and/or duration of heat waves; (3) a decrease in precipitation; (4) the intensity and duration of droughts; (5) storms, torrential rain, and floods; (6) a rise in sea level; and (7) more frequent wildfires.</p>
