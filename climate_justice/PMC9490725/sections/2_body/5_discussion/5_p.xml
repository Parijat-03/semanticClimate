First, we must accept that climate change mitigation is a political problem requiring political decisions. Second, these political decisions must encompass both traditional spheres of operational regulation (from safety to market power to environmental limits) as well as new approaches to the economy such as reducing the total amount of goods transported. This approach does not exclude market actors; the advantages of a supply-side approach and a ban on fossil fuels are that technical responses (hydrogen, ammonia, electricity, wind, etc.) are left to the market.</p>
