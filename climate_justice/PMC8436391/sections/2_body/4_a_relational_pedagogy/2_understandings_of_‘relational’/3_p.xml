<p>This kind of relational approach is modelled and applied in a university context when drawing
on community development approaches. Research reported by <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Lathouras (2020)</xref> sought to investigate if the university context could be a site for
developing a sense of &#8216;community&#8217; for international students whose well-being,
learning outcomes and retention were being compromised by a commodified education system. Using
Paulo <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Freire&#8217;s (1972)</xref> critical consciousness
through dialogue approach, students were brought together and exposed to a social learning
agenda that enabled them to perceive social, political and economic contradictions and
collectively support each other to respond to the issues they were facing. The 2-year
action-research project resulted in the creation of a peer support program (called Dialogue
Circles) that enabled a community-oriented and inclusive co-learning environment for students
in a cross-cultural classroom. The research demonstrated that a university perceived to be more
like a &#8216;community&#8217; supports students&#8217; academic, cultural, emotional and
social connectedness needs and translates into positive educational outcomes.</p>
