Granted, the end of the world is not a new idea if we look at the historical record, particularly when it comes to religious apocalypticism; the end of the world has always been imminent, right around the corner for certain groups of religious believers. But there is something fundamentally different about the &#8220;end of the world&#8221; discussion that is happening now, which is less about religious apocalypticism and more about the abundance of scientific data. For example, there is now ample evidence of irreversible climate change, prompting <italic>Scientific American</italic> in early 2021 to declare that it will no longer use the more understated term &#8220;climate change&#8221; but from now on would only use the more precise term &#8220;climate emergency&#8221; in its coverage of the developing crisis: &#8220;The climate emergency has arrived, and is accelerating more rapidly than most scientists anticipated. . the adverse effects of climate change are much more severe than expected and now threaten both the biosphere and humanity&#8221; (Ripple et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>).</p>
