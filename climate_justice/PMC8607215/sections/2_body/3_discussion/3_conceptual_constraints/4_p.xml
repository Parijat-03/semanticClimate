The principle implies that the state is complicit in an obstructive act that interferes with the rights of the general public. A similar assertion was articulated in <italic>Leghari v Pakistan</italic>, where a local farmer filed a petition alleging that the government&#8217;s insufficient climate action violated basic rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In upholding the claim, judge Ali Shah noted that indeed rising GHGs symbolized present-day threat to mankind, and the state must take urgent measures to fast-track the operationalization of its national climate policy. To that end, the energy sector&#8217;s emissions qualify as a public nuisance as it impinges on a sizeable number of the population. This is particularly the case as access to water and good health are entrenched rights that the state ought to safeguard, rather than interfere with their enjoyments.</p>
