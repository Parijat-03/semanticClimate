Massive fiscal intervention by governments will set the direction of economies&#8212;and emissions&#8212;for years to come. So far, EU and Chinese reactions to the pandemic look different in climate terms. The EU is doubling down on climate action, while the Chinese response is ambiguous. EU pandemic stimulus has been quite well aligned with the Paris Agreement&#8217;s transformative Article 2.1c goal&#8212;the achievement of which is a prerequisite for meeting climate justice demands in the long term. In <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref>, the picture is more mixed but may still develop in a positive direction, as the country prepares to achieve the 30/60 targets. Greater engagement on sustainable finance between the EU and China could assist in generating momentum for green recovery, including by exploring opportunities for coordination and alignment. This engagement could be pursued bilaterally as well as in fora such as the International Platform on Sustainable Finance and the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action.</p>
