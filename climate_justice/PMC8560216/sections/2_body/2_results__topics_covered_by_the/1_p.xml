In addition to taking an intersectional approach, the podcast was motivated to support development of holistic ecoliteracy, where guest speakers share interdisciplinary science-based research perspectives to better understand ecosystems while also considering their ethical, cultural, and political dimensions (Hempel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). Ultimately, the podcast tries to capture stories that embody a &#8220;transdisciplinary form of ecoliteracy that includes experiential learning, knowledge of personal and social responsibility, and understanding of the roles of governance and communication in moving from knowledge to action&#8221; (Hempel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>, p. 45). Based on inductive content analysis (Birch and Weitkamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Neuman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>) of the topics covered by invited guests, four main themes emerged from the first podcast season: environmental justice, structural racism and conservation, traditional ecological knowledge, and access to nature and the outdoors.</p>
