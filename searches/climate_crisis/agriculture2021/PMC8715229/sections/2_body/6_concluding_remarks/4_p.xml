The alternative is locking in investments during the recovery that are not viable in the long run. Currently only a fraction of the fiscal spending made available in response to the pandemic is focused on enabling a green recovery (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">O'Callaghan and Murdock, 2021</xref>). The centrality of food system transformations for sustainable development pathways has also been well established and recognized for its potential of generating significant economic benefits (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>). The transformation of food systems will require upfront investments and international collaboration. For example, to meet their stated commitment of lifting 500 million people out of hunger and malnourishment, G7 countries would need to approximately double their efforts, adding 14 billion USD to their current annual spending of 12 billion USD each year from now until 2030 (<xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">von Braun et al., 2020</xref>). With further recovery spending to be issued, the opportunity to build in equity, sustainability and resilience concerns should not be missed.</p>
