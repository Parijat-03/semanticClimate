The Health Care Units (HCUs) generating bio-medical waste, have been categorized on the basis of bed strength. Bio Medical Waste Management Cell has been created in Delhi Pollution Control    Committee for the implementation of the various provisions of the Bio- Medical Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1998 in health care units. Inspections are carried out to check the compliance of the BMW Rules and deficiencies observed if any are communicated by way of Show Cause Notices /Letters to the Health Care Establishments for rectification of the deficiencies. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.07" top="617.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="617.43" x1="526.07" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 617.43; y1: 629.43; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">To introduce the Green Building Concept/ ensure control of pollution, for efficient waste management, energy &amp; water conservation, Delhi Pollution Control Committee has issued directions to hospitals having 50 beds or more to install: Solar Water heating system, Rain Water harvesting system, Replace ordinary bulbs with Ligh Emitting Diode (LED) Bulbs, install Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)/Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) for recycling of treated effluent for use in horticulture, air conditioning/cooling plants and flushing of toilets etc and plant trees along side of the periphery of the hospitals building. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="525.96" top="494.28"><span x0="72.02" y0="494.28" x1="525.96" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 76.02; y0: 494.28; y1: 506.28; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Initiatives of DPCC have led to ISO 14001 accreditation of 12 major hospitals in the City, which ensures proper environmental management system in place within the hospital. Further to this, in order to control mercury pollution, DPCC has initiated the drive for minimization/elimination of use of mercury  containing equipment&#8217;s in health care establishments and for safe disposal plan for collected mercury waste in hospitals, DPCC has identified two industrial units for recycle  and reuse of mercury stored in the HCUs. Various public notices are issued and workshops/training are organized by DPCC in leading newspapers highlighting the need for proper implementation of Bio-medical (management &amp; Handling) rules. </span></div><div left="90.02" right="308.69" top="339.22"><span x0="90.02" y0="339.22" x1="308.69" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 96.02; y0: 339.22; y1: 351.22; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; stroke: [0, 0.533, 0.529]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">12.5Impact of climate change on health </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.13" top="307.78"><span x0="72.02" y0="307.78" x1="526.13" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 307.78; y1: 319.78; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Climate change presents risks for human health. Projected increases in temperature may increase the frequency of heat waves and thermal stress leading to heat related disorders such as heat cramps, dehydration, leading to heat stroke, influenza, cardio&#8208;vascular and respiratory diseases. Flood or drought by contrast would affect the agriculture sector and reduce crop productivity. This in turn could reduce food availability resulting in malnutrition or inadequate nutrition as well as nutrition related diseases. While on one hand, malnutrition would reduce resistance to infections by weakening hosts&#8217; immune response, infectious diseases decrease the nutrient absorption capacity resulting in nutrition deficits. Several studies have established a link between deficiencies in micronutrients (vitamin A, zinc, iron etc.) and significant incidents of malaria morbidity and mortality. Heavy rain as projected in certain areas would adversely affect crop production, causing soil erosion and increasingly limit employment in the sector with negative implications on livelihoods. Floods could directly contaminate drinking water and cause outbursts of water borne diseases such as diarrhea. Warming trends will favour the spread of vector borne diseases (malaria, kala azar, and dengue) into new areas by shortening the development duration of vectors (mainly mosquitoes).
