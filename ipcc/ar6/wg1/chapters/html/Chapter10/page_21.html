Three-dimensional observations revealed the contrasts in regional characteristics of rainfall extremes in monsoon regions and continental dry regions (Sohn et&#160;al., 2013; Hamada and Takayabu, 2018). Satellite measurements are also used to evaluate climate model performance, as well as to develop new parametrizations. As a&#160;demonstration of the utility of these products in studying model bias, a&#160;subtropical cumulus congestus regime has been identified that may be implicated in the unrealistic double Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) found in some climate models (Takayabu et&#160;al., 2010; Hirota et&#160;al., 2011, 2014). Another example is a&#160;parametrization of a&#160;land surface model that was developed specifically for a&#160;certain soil type. By assimilating satellite brightness temperature observations with their LDAS-UT scheme, Yang et&#160;al. (2007) successfully optimized a&#160;land surface model for the Tibetan Plateau.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="498.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="498.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.74; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">For application at a&#160;regional scale, it is important to consider variations in the spatiotemporal resolution of the satellite products. A&#160;simple concatenation of data in time can show artificial jumps that are artefacts of changes in calibration and processing algorithms, or related to satellite orbital stability or changing performance of the instruments (Wielicki et&#160;al., 2013; Barrett et&#160;al., 2014). Recalibration and cross-calibration are then prerequisites for obtaining homogeneous time series of measurements across different or successive satellites that can then be used to produce long series that are valid as climate data records (Kanemaru et&#160;al., 2017; Merchant et&#160;al., 2017). Scale representativeness is also an issue in utilizing soil observations (Taylor et&#160;al., 2012, 2013). Although a&#160;variety of technologies to measure soil moisture at the point scale exist (Dobriyal et&#160;al., 2012), its spatial representativeness is less than 1 m</span><span x0="220.52" y0="346.76" x1="223.18" style="x0: 220.52; x1: 223.18; y0: 346.76; y1: 352.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2</span><span x0="225.69" y0="342.6" x1="304.74" style="x0: 225.69; x1: 228.33; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(Ochsner et&#160;al., 2013; L.

Therefore, to be able to use in situ soil moisture for validating coarser-scale data from satellites or models, networks of point-scale measurements are used (Crow et&#160;al., 2015; Polcher et&#160;al., 2016).

These products encompass many physical and dynamical processes. They generate a&#160;coherent estimate of the state of the climate system on uniform grids either at global (Chaudhuri et&#160;al., 2013; Balsamo et&#160;al., 2015), regional (Chaney et&#160;al., 2014; Maidment et&#160;al., 2014; Dahlgren et&#160;al., 2016; Langodan et&#160;al., 2017; Attada et&#160;al., 2018; Mahmood et&#160;al., 2018) or country scales (Rostkier-Edelstein et&#160;al., 2014; Kr&#228;henmann et&#160;al., 2018; Mahmood et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="522.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="522.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Reanalyses incorporate an increasing volume of observations from a&#160;growing number of sources over time, which sometimes presents a&#160;difficulty for trend analysis. However, regional reanalyses are valuable for regional climate assessments, since they can employ high-resolution model simulations due to their limited spatial domain. Their accuracy is also better than global reanalyses since they are often developed over regions with a&#160;high density of observational data (sometimes not freely available for all regions) to be assimilated into the model (e.g.,&#160;Yamada et&#160;al., 2012). Regional reanalyses can assimilate locally dense and high-frequency observations, such as from local observation networks (Mahmood et&#160;al., 2018; Su et&#160;al., 2019) and radar precipitation (Wahl et&#160;al., 2017) in addition to the observations assimilated by global reanalyses. In some regional reanalyses, satellite-derived high-resolution sea ice (Bromwich et&#160;al., 2016, 2018) and sea surface temperature (Su et&#160;al., 2019) are also applied as lower boundary conditions. The periods of regional reanalyses are limited by the availability of the observations for assimilation and by the global reanalyses needed as lateral boundary conditions. Most regional reanalyses cover the past 10 to 30 years. There are also regional reanalysis activities that use conventional observations only, which produce consistent datasets over 60 years to capture precipitation trends, extremes and changes (Fukui et&#160;al., 2018). Existing regional reanalyses cover North America (Mesinger et&#160;al., 2006), Europe (Dahlgren et&#160;al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Kaspar et&#160;al., 2020), the Arctic (Bromwich et&#160;al., 2016, 2018), South Asia (Mahmood et&#160;al., 2018), and Australia (Su et&#160;al., 2019). A&#160;project for regional reanalysis covering Japan has also started (Fukui et&#160;al., 2018), where grid spacing is between 5 and 32 km, although cumulus parametrizations are still needed to compute sub-grid scale cumulus convection. Recently, reanalyses using convection-permitting regional models have been published (e.g.,&#160;Wahl et&#160;al., 2017, for central Europe).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="126.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="126.6" x1="563.26" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The data assimilation schemes used in regional reanalyses are often relatively simple methods, specifically nudging (Kaspar et&#160;al., 2020) and 3DVAR (Mesinger et&#160;al., 2006; Bromwich et&#160;al., 2016; Dahlgren et&#160;al., 2016), rather than the more complex schemes implemented in state-of-the-art global reanalysis systems. This is partly due to limitations of computational resources. Recently, a&#160;number of regional reanalyses using more sophisticated methods, such as </span></div></body></html>
