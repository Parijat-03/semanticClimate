GSW also develops a holistic approach that examines the diverse impacts on individuals, families, communities, and societies. These areas for improvement in GSW education and training in particular, social work education, and professional training in general call for pedagogical evidence and outcomes to apply multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder engagement in disaster-driven community development.
