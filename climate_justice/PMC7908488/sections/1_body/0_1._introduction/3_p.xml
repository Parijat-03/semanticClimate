<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Heating patterns in dryland urban regions are often more complex than for wetter temperate regions. Dryland cities often contain more green vegetation than surrounding desert or grassland, and so may be somewhat cooler than surrounding landscapes during the daytime [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At night, this pattern may be reversed, as desert landscapes cool off more quickly than urban ones. However, during both day and night, temperatures in these cities may be high enough to pose serious problems for human communities.</p>
