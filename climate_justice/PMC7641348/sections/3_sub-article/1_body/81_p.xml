This is increasingly challenging as CES has been tasked to cover more and more policy areas, from toxic waste management, to air quality management, to drinking water. The article could help argue that while holistic tools like CES are very valuable for directing resources to address overall vulnerability/ disadvantage, more context-specific tools (or perhaps customized modules) will be needed.</p>
