<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0140">Content analysis has the property of delivering key definitions and insights on a topic &#8211; even of great magnitude. Content analysis has also the feature to pave the way for future investigations. Indeed, it sheds light on a topical issue, enlarging research outlooks, and encouraging new studies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bos and Tarnai, 1999</xref>). Content analyses risk having some sort of subjectivity. That is why, in this exercise, the methodological choices were kept as robust as possible, producing a solid summative content analysis. To this end, the <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Millennium Ecosystems Assessment (2005)</xref> guidelines &#8211; among the most reputable methodological sources for running content analyses &#8211; were exploited. This inquiry's choices, context and analyses were based on all the recommended steps. Besides, justifications for each technical step and methodological decisions were provided.</p>
