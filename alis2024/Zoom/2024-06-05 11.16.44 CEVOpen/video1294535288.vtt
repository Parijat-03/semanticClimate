00:00:01.073 --> 00:00:08.073
Okay. Right, well done. Excellent. Okay.

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:17.624
So this is, Apart which will come probably partly at the end. And partly at the beginning.

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:28.823
And he wants to, it's going to deal with the technology of creating, semantic material automatically from non-smantic material.

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:38.623
But I just want to say a little bit about the history and, where what we're doing fits into.

00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:59.624
The general development of information. Now, what we are doing is actually quite Revolution. But, it built from a concept which was popularized by Vannevar Bush.

00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:03.623
1,945. So that's, 80 years ago.

00:01:04.723 --> 00:01:06.723
You can see my screen, can't you?

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:26.524
Right, okay. And he came up with the idea of a device called the Memex. Which would store everything that went on books records communications as fast as possible.

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:11.873
Yes.

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:36.573
And it was an automatic personal filing system. Have any of you ever, use filing cards?

00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:44.323
So I think I'll just show you. This, we don't use them anymore.

00:01:54.973 --> 00:02:05.973
But this is a, convenient, file card system. Can you see a bit of that?

00:02:05.773 --> 00:02:19.773
And within it individual cards that you write on okay that's called a filing card system And this is called a file.

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:32.124
And That is how, library catalogues were organized. And how many of them still are.

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:46.573
Organized. So if you go into some libraries you'll find massive cabinets which consist of file cards and that's really influenced Rangap in his faceted.

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:59.023
Classification. Now, Bush was later, 1945, and he came up with the idea of something which would record everything you did.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:12.574
That was a, Hi, for, some, time, but then, and he came up with a fanciful machine.

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:33.373
So this is a typical example. Of what the machine might look like. You can see it's got various tablets on the top, so that's very, advanced And, it's got, I think these are recording on tape.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:44.024
This is, I think. Computer tape at that stage, magnetic tape. Okay.

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:56.073
So, So the idea here is to come up with something that records everything and makes it.

00:03:55.523 --> 00:04:08.523
He and natural to find anything you want. And people been working on this for 50. Or more years.

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:23.224
Now. The other thing I want to talk about is recording at source. So what we do, is we use something called Open Notebook science.

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:26.373
And I will.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:45.873
This was pioneered by Donco Bradley. And it is the practice of making the entire primary record of a research project.

00:04:45.473 --> 00:05:07.473
Publicly available online. As it is recorded. So. It was promoted by, Jean Claude Bradley, and actually, he was going to call it open science, but I persuaded him to call it open notebook science.

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:22.674
And Here's a picture of John Code. And, this was so important, that, He was honored by President Obama.

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:36.523
He died tragically young? And I and others organized a memorial. Symposium in Cambridge to honor his legacy.

00:05:35.573 --> 00:05:45.573
So. Hey, his idea is that everything you do is available to the whole world as you do it.

00:05:44.324 --> 00:06:02.324
And we have been, taking that idea, and trying to put it into practice. It's difficult mainly because the tools don't exist and because the culture needs changing.

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:10.174
People are trained in universities very often to keep everything. To themselves, particularly if they're going to be assessed.

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:21.274
And, researchers, have the culture that they, the primary purpose of research is to compete against other researchers.

00:06:21.723 --> 00:06:34.723
So open notebook science It's taking a long time. Develop. But at least the preprint culture is part of the way the towards it.

00:06:34.223 --> 00:07:01.223
The problem we have in publication at the moment and Ranganison would undoubtedly have had, things to say about this is that you create your primary record let's say in a laboratory notebook where you write it in or type it in and you collect data off a an instrument.

00:07:00.324 --> 00:07:19.324
And then. You transcribe this to, paper. Often with loss of information both mistakes and omissions and then you published the paper which is a snapshot of that research.

00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:29.524
Now we know that what we're doing is dynamic. So we are doing this day by day. We're capturing it day by day.

00:07:27.224 --> 00:07:44.224
And a snapshot does not give the totality. So, current message of static publication do not capture the full dynamic range of what we're doing.

00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:56.823
So having said that, I now want to move on to the technical details as to how we create, semantic information.

00:07:55.823 --> 00:08:12.823
We are not doing experiments. We are, creating recordings. Talks. Software and so on and as far as possible we're doing that under the open notebook for philosophy.

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:24.823
That is that people have access to it as soon as it is created. Github has that, facility so that as soon as you create.

00:08:24.724 --> 00:08:31.724
A piece of software. You, Up, load it to a public repository.

00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:54.523
Usually with only a a delay of about. You know, a day or something of that sort. And that was very much the ethos of the human genome project, which, worked on the basis that all sequences they collected were uploaded to sample repositories by the end of the day.

00:08:53.723 --> 00:09:07.723
And that's 1 of the great, examples of open the notebook science. It's actually predated the term.

00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:13.423
It was called the Bermuda protocol. And it's a milestone.

00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:25.623
And open source. And it's a great pity that we have moved to the situation where people are obsessed with measuring their performance.

00:09:24.673 --> 00:09:32.673
With metrics and those metrics are controlled by the publishers and the publishers have no interest.

00:09:31.924 --> 00:09:46.924
In open notebook science or anything open. So. That's something which will need to be built into the system in the future.

00:09:45.473 --> 00:10:00.473
So when Doing what we can with that, but our main activity of semantic output. Is, the different windows we have on climate.

00:09:59.423 --> 00:10:14.423
We have, PYGET papers and dock analysis. Which allow us to search the literature recently this has been extended with open Alex.

00:10:13.373 --> 00:10:28.373
And, we can search. Tens of millions of scholarly articles for climate information

00:10:29.673 --> 00:10:48.673
We can normally retrieve the metadata for that, and in some cases we can automatically record the PDF or in cases where it's been published fully open in the

00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:54.423
Pubmed Central System, we're able to read the XML as well.

00:10:53.424 --> 00:11:03.424
That's semi semantic in that the document has semantic structure, but for the body of the work.

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:08.674
It doesn't have semantic labeling, on the components.

00:11:09.073 --> 00:11:24.073
But we are working on, making that more and more semantic labeling paragraphs, so on and that's available in the output of dock analysis, and Aimee.

00:11:24.173 --> 00:11:37.173
So that's a fully semantic. Structure but not necessarily annotated with a schema which is universal.

00:11:36.423 --> 00:11:49.423
Then we have, the, FCC reports. And again, that's lower priority than the IPCC material at the moment.

00:11:42.224 --> 00:12:02.224
But the FCC reports are. A list of several 100 I think several 100.

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:11.423
Pdf. Documents. They are not semantic.

00:12:09.723 --> 00:12:21.723
They have no markup and no annotation, but they are written in a consistent format. So we're able to essentially build a template.

00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:32.224
Or the IPCC. And turn that into something with. A considerable degree of That's semantic.

00:12:31.424 --> 00:12:52.424
Macro and micro structure and with some of the terms. Identified and labeled. But the main enhancement of that comes with our ability to search the generated HTML.

00:12:51.973 --> 00:13:01.973
And to link that into. Our glossary system. So we'll come to the IPCC glossary.

00:13:01.924 --> 00:13:16.924
Now glossary is absolutely essential to and adding, and understanding and markup. The terms that are used are glossary.

00:13:16.874 --> 00:13:28.874
Dictionary. And sometimes. And so on. But, We use the word dictionary, but it is a very loose term.

00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:32.274
And it allows

00:13:32.023 --> 00:13:44.023
Supportive glossary operations. So the IPCC call that. Now, the IPCC glossary.

00:13:43.275 --> 00:13:59.275
Is available in EDF form. I think I have to check that. But it's available in a rather inaccessible, HTML, form.

00:14:00.123 --> 00:14:13.123
It has. Entries for each term, which are separate downloads. So I'll just have a look and see if we can find IPCC.

00:14:23.723 --> 00:14:30.723
Right. So this is it. It's got these terms here. And you can click on this.

00:14:29.723 --> 00:14:41.723
So if we were interested in which we saw earlier today. You click on that and it gives the definition and the parent.

00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:57.223
At 10. But this is in HTML which is not easily downloadable and because it's served by a servant.

00:14:57.073 --> 00:15:18.073
Which requires some. Intelligence on the research. Receiving and So, IS, G, again, was able to, write, headless browser tool that allows us to download all of this.

00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:30.873
Automatically. And the results of this are about 700 terms, which, are available in that sort of form.

00:15:31.023 --> 00:15:42.023
I'm which have been put into the glossary that Simon, Worthington has transformed into semantic HTML.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:50.474
So that's glossary. Now that glossary is a universal glossary for all the reports.

00:15:49.873 --> 00:16:02.873
But there are also individual glossaries. Chap. No, each working group. So if I go into.

00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:10.223
Hi PCC. Kamliji 3.

00:16:12.423 --> 00:16:25.423
We have an annex. And this glossary here. Is a PDF file. So that you see, it's got to be transformed.

00:16:25.224 --> 00:16:33.224
Into something more useful and it does not overlap. It's overlaps a lot with that.

00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:48.023
Communal glossary, but it does have terms which are not in the communal gloss. So by downloading all the glossaries or the individual chapters we can.

00:16:49.423 --> 00:16:59.423
Enhance that central glossary. And we're doing so as well. And then the other thing that some of the.

00:17:03.873 --> 00:17:14.873
Reports but not all of them do. Is they give abbreviations. Annexes.

00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:24.323
Okay, I'm sorry. Johnloads and I think that's PDF. Acronyms, that's it.

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:27.724
So if we look at acronyms. Downloads.

00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:41.941
Yeah, we got that. And this is PDF. And these are the acronyms which are particularly relevant to W 3.

00:17:44.223 --> 00:17:46.223
So.

00:17:46.723 --> 00:17:56.723
50 acronyms a page. And we've got about 7 or 8 pages. So we've got a few 100 acronyms.

00:17:56.173 --> 00:18:06.173
And if we collect together all the acronyms. That we've got from the various working groups.

00:18:07.524 --> 00:18:13.524
Then. We'll be able to have something which is much larger.

00:18:13.523 --> 00:18:27.523
But you see this act this one WG 3 doesn't have a marker in it. I'll have a quick look and see whether anything in WG.

00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:30.773
One.

00:18:34.473 --> 00:18:37.473
But page not found, I expected that.

00:18:40.123 --> 00:18:49.123
I won't spend time. Going working group. And

00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:58.774
Yeah. This is, I find extremely difficult to navigate.

00:19:01.023 --> 00:19:03.023
Here's physical science.

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:26.123
I don't see anything there about acronyms at all. So each report is different.

00:19:27.724 --> 00:19:40.724
But, we can hopefully between us now, collect all that together. So I expect at our glossary consists of Probably about

00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:51.173
I'm going to guess about 1,500 terms, that, there will be probably an additional, 3 or 400.

00:19:48.323 --> 00:20:01.323
Acronyms which are not. In those terms. And so we're going to end up with somewhere around about 2,000 and entries in this glossary.

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:10.723
And we will automatically look them up in Wikipedia and weiki data wherever possible.

00:20:10.973 --> 00:20:18.973
So that's a glossary. The glossary is there to inform us, but it's also there to create search terms.

00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:27.524
So that, we will probably, go through the process of, adding regular expression search terms.

00:20:26.373 --> 00:20:37.373
To many of the terms in the glossary. The good thing is it's a static glossary, so we probably only need to do it.

00:20:37.123 --> 00:20:48.123
Okay, that's, the glossary. Then. I've talked about the FCC, haven't I?

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:58.774
I just to say that we can use the glossary to search the FCC. And, add, semantic meaning to the term.

00:20:52.323 --> 00:21:11.323
So if it contains something like I don't know. In there anywhere then, we can link this to.

00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:20.373
And then finally we come to the IPCC chapters. The IPCC chapters are primarily made available.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:25.823
In PDF.

00:21:27.624 --> 00:21:38.624
So if we go into let's say WG one. Yeah, and we've got something that says

00:21:42.373 --> 00:21:44.373
We're on the chances.

00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:52.973
I think we have to go into reports.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.023
Read the report.

00:21:55.723 --> 00:21:57.723
Maybe I put.

00:21:57.673 --> 00:22:07.673
I think this will do it for us. So yes, so we go into. This, and we go to downloads.

00:22:02.723 --> 00:22:03.723
Thank you.

00:22:06.724 --> 00:22:25.724
And these are chapter in PDF. But if you go to the Explore button here this is the HTML and you will see it contains expand and contract.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:43.424
Sections. Now. To get that down, we have to use a headless browser, which our, created and it's possible to download all those reports in full, with the headless browser.

00:22:44.273 --> 00:22:54.273
Technology. So we work mainly from the. Html and not from the PDF.

00:22:57.223 --> 00:23:05.223
When we've got the HTML, what we then, need to do is to make it semantic.

00:23:04.923 --> 00:23:14.923
You will see here that if I go into this section, one dot one. Then it has a subsection.

00:23:16.023 --> 00:23:28.023
Oh, this is probably a subsection. This is section one. No, this. What's this number?

00:23:29.073 --> 00:23:36.073
I think this is chapter one. Chapter one. Section one.

00:23:37.773 --> 00:23:43.773
Subsection one. And sometimes we go down to

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:49.424
Sub sub sections. I don't know if it does it here.

00:23:51.073 --> 00:24:01.073
Some of them are more deeply nested than others. And this is. A bot?

00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:08.223
This is a figure. So we can get down the figures and the captions to the figures are really important here.

00:24:07.774 --> 00:24:16.774
And one or 2 other things to note. Is that there are some hyperlinks here. So pointing into sections.

00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:23.223
And at the end of some of them.

00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:29.674
There are links to other.

00:24:30.624 --> 00:24:41.624
These are links, sometimes 2 references. Cross chapter box. And here you can see we've actually got a link to another section.

00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:45.124
One dot 2 dot.

00:24:48.924 --> 00:24:58.924
Not very easy to navigate, is it? So we try and honor all of these sections here.

00:24:58.374 --> 00:25:12.374
And make it easy to navigate. So we have semantic. Labelling for all of the parts and if I go into on these here.

00:25:13.473 --> 00:25:17.473
It's not a good example going to this.

00:25:22.523 --> 00:25:27.523
Yeah, this one contains 1. 2 3 4

00:25:29.023 --> 00:25:31.023
Powerographs and a box.

00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:52.925
And 5. 6, 7. So the paragraphs will be numbered paragraph one to 7, and the box will be, labeled with its particular identity, fire here, which should be universal across the system.

00:25:52.874 --> 00:26:01.874
So, what we're immediately offering is a navigation system. That. As far as I know, nobody else.

00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:08.473
Offered and it will should be much easier to use. Than the HTML you've got here.

00:26:07.773 --> 00:26:16.773
We've got some work to do on that because, this is, if we open this up.

00:26:17.773 --> 00:26:25.773
In Come back here, open it up. And

00:26:26.623 --> 00:26:38.623
This you will see that this has got. Gatsby display markup. So that doesn't have any semantic meaning.

00:26:37.623 --> 00:26:50.623
Gatsby focus wrapper. Has no meaning in terms of climate change. And so on and many of these can probably be ignored.

00:26:51.274 --> 00:26:56.274
But when we finally come down to

00:26:58.173 --> 00:27:09.173
Sections here. We've got, titles here which That tells what the various sections are.

00:27:08.824 --> 00:27:19.824
So we will have a semi-smantic. A set of components from the IPCC chapters and that's probably.

00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:27.941
That and the glossary are our main. Thrusts at the moment. The pie get paper stuff.

00:27:27.823 --> 00:27:37.823
Will come. And but, the drawback to that is. And that we have to do more work on the actual content.

00:27:38.173 --> 00:27:48.173
To So I think I've said most of what I want to say. In all of this.

00:27:47.474 --> 00:28:04.474
We've got 3. Main sections. We've got the introduction about climate change and, Oh, we've got a main body about, and all of the components.

00:28:04.073 --> 00:28:15.073
What they are and then at the end we've got a technical section on how we analyze this and make these a magnification.

00:28:14.274 --> 00:28:24.274
Automatic. Simon is talking about all the social aspects of semantic climate. So are there.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.940
Comments or questions in particular what have I missed out?

00:28:35.823 --> 00:28:40.823
So basically, you're not just, talked about the.

00:28:39.374 --> 00:28:50.374
Yep, well done. We're going to, we're going to talk about that. So we talked about what we were going to do but not how we were going to do it.

00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:47.939
Hmm.

00:28:50.924 --> 00:29:06.924
Very good thinking indeed. So. Our software, so this is another section, our software, is developed in a modular fashion.

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:17.974
And here I'm going to show my pie chum. Display of this. There is a general component called Amy Lib.

00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:27.674
Yeah. And, is a collection of libraries. Which are generally useful for documents.

00:29:26.874 --> 00:29:40.874
And analysis classification, cementification. Reuse and republicate. So they apply to any set of documents.

00:29:41.123 --> 00:29:50.123
In principle. Without going through all of them We have something that deals with the bibliography.

00:29:50.173 --> 00:30:05.173
Tools that deal with CSV. I've recently added a tool which supports dictionaries so that we can create dictionaries easily and we can used it for annotation.

00:30:04.723 --> 00:30:15.723
The library for HTML. Library on natural language processing routines. Library on converting PDF.

00:30:14.324 --> 00:30:23.324
Which is a key thing since we get so much PDF. Small one on SVG.

00:30:22.723 --> 00:30:30.723
So we're possible. We convert the graphics to SVG, which is a semantically structured.

00:30:30.124 --> 00:30:42.124
Tool. We got utilities, headless browser driver. Rounding boxes.

00:30:41.224 --> 00:30:52.224
File utilities at this browser game. Various. Things for the command line, HTML logs and Yeah, fogs.

00:30:51.524 --> 00:31:05.524
And we were allowed one for dictionary. And various HTML tools. And then look up for Wikimedia and libraries for XML.

00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:14.024
Many of these are convenience libraries, which means that, we have a wrap around some of the more.

00:31:13.873 --> 00:31:23.873
Difficult parts of Python. So how do I join a list? With, commerce.

00:31:23.574 --> 00:31:34.574
And then Formal way of doing that is very arcane for people just learning computer science, computer.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:41.474
Systems. And so on. So that's Amy Lib. And then with each.

00:31:40.274 --> 00:31:57.274
L, we have an extensive set of tests. So These are the tests. We've just started to include and so for example, yes test.

00:31:56.924 --> 00:32:10.924
Set of dictionary tests. And I go here and press. And so.

00:32:10.974 --> 00:32:18.974
Yeah. Is a class with all the tests and and I think it's got nearly 60 tests.

00:32:18.874 --> 00:32:28.874
So here you see. Look up missing wiki data IDs by term. Debug chapter dictionaries.

00:32:28.223 --> 00:32:42.223
This, ambiguate wiki data IDs. Create dictionary from a list of strings you will all be doing that because you're creating a list of terms you're interested in.

00:32:41.573 --> 00:32:54.573
Some of them are just, addiction, so, ethnobotanics and So on.

00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:58.673
Some of them maybe.

00:32:58.424 --> 00:33:10.424
Skipped if there are too many of them but this actually runs quite quickly. Add second list of entries.

00:33:10.023 --> 00:33:20.023
I don't think we would term. Get wiki data of 1st entry. And sound a whole lot of tests.

00:33:22.123 --> 00:33:24.123
So let me run this.

00:33:25.173 --> 00:33:31.173
A good thing about running it is If it doesn't work, then.

00:33:33.473 --> 00:33:39.473
I have an incentive to do this, but hopefully.

00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:46.673
Well, it's still red, which means it's running.

00:33:51.224 --> 00:34:02.224
Tests. So that's our test should run. There's no very little download in this. We've got 86 tests.

00:34:01.724 --> 00:34:13.724
It's finished in 21 seconds for me. 7 tests failed. And I can have a look and see why those tests failed.

00:34:14.924 --> 00:34:16.924
They're yellow.

00:34:23.674 --> 00:34:35.674
But, file should exist. So. There is a test file in my previous incarnation. Of this called pi for Amy.

00:34:35.123 --> 00:34:39.123
I haven't copied it over so that's very clear.

00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:42.723
Files that exist.

00:34:47.723 --> 00:34:54.723
Right cannot open. I've got a software error there. I've got to mend that.

00:34:55.723 --> 00:34:58.723
File should exist.

00:35:00.673 --> 00:35:02.673
Miles should exist.

00:35:07.224 --> 00:35:17.224
This is an error which you should recognize non-type object as no attributes get or create.

00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:23.573
Something or other. What it means is you created an object which you're going to do something with.

00:35:22.373 --> 00:35:30.373
And it turned out that that object didn't get created. And so you had a none object instead.

00:35:30.273 --> 00:35:40.273
So. Okay, get used to that. And that's so we got 5 did not exist. I have to mend that.

00:35:32.923 --> 00:35:44.923
We've got one, Well, we've got none object. I've got to debug that.

00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:56.123
And then we've got some other I've got to men. So I'm feeling quite optimistic about that when I get some time.

00:35:57.673 --> 00:36:03.673
I will mend that and commit it. No, in this that we

00:36:05.573 --> 00:36:07.573
We have down here, GET.

00:36:06.573 --> 00:36:16.573
And I'm on TMR Dick's at the moment. So I've got several branches.

00:36:14.623 --> 00:36:31.623
PMR test is where I was, developing some of the Amy, staff, the dict is something, related to dictionary so you can develop different things at the same time.

00:36:31.124 --> 00:36:43.124
And none of this will cause problems for Nitica who's got her own branch. Which is called, nitica test or something of that sort.

00:36:42.273 --> 00:36:53.273
And which she can commit up to the, the main. If necessary.

00:36:52.873 --> 00:37:02.873
At some stage we need to merge this. Merging it's easy if you do it frequently and it's a nightmare.

00:36:56.773 --> 00:37:08.773
If you take months, before you do it. So at some stage, I will merge this back.

00:37:07.673 --> 00:37:20.673
You will then find that, your, tests have errors, and we have to then mendows.

00:37:20.073 --> 00:37:34.073
And commit a greater a larger and enhanced main first.st But that's Oh yes, remote.

00:37:35.173 --> 00:37:36.173
Nitica test, they are.

00:37:35.924 --> 00:37:44.924
So, so. All of that works, very nicely. Or. I.

00:37:44.473 --> 00:37:50.473
And then the next thing. I'm going to show you is.

00:37:52.223 --> 00:37:54.223
Hey, climate.

00:37:54.423 --> 00:38:04.423
Recent projects, in climate. So here is. And time it.

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:12.073
And here again, we work it by having tests. There's a whole lot of test data here.

00:38:11.424 --> 00:38:19.424
So you can see I've got captors in here to read. And in particular one called, content.

00:38:18.223 --> 00:38:29.223
Which should approximate the final versions of the particular I think so, it's not.

00:38:30.273 --> 00:38:47.273
Comprehensive but I probably will make it comprehensive so so that those people who got chapters will have a semantic version of their chapter because at the moment there's some problem about headless browsers with some of you.

00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:54.474
So we will create that. It doesn't. Logically fit in test. I should.

00:38:53.674 --> 00:39:05.674
It possible to put it somewhere in the system. What I'm likely to do, is to create a dictionary.

00:39:04.824 --> 00:39:21.824
Direct for somewhere in the system. And we might ask everybody to have a directory under their home directory called dictionary where the dictionaries are put.

00:39:21.373 --> 00:39:35.373
Or we'll probably call it, . Something of that sort. It's, always difficult because it depends on people.

00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:42.224
How people use things, but you may need to check out separate repository with all this stuff in.

00:39:41.723 --> 00:39:49.723
And we will probably call it semantic time. I think we've got a semantic climate dictionary somewhere.

00:39:50.824 --> 00:40:01.824
So, Amy Climate, will look at the, Tests. So. Let's look at test IPCC.

00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:15.274
Here is our structure. And here we've got about. 30 tests. And you can see things like remove cats being mark up.

00:40:15.324 --> 00:40:26.324
Remove wordpress mark up At 6 WT 3 and index chapters with IDs. So that looks like a pretty important one because.

00:40:21.273 --> 00:40:41.273
Let's see what it does. We chapter, search for words and return a list of paragraphs in which they're So.

00:40:40.273 --> 00:40:49.273
Hey, we're looking for these phrases. We're reading in WT. 3 chapter 3.

00:40:49.124 --> 00:40:55.124
With the HTML with IDs, which is our, more or less final version.

00:40:54.573 --> 00:41:05.573
And then we will end up with some paragraphs here. Now, what we probably want to do is to save those.

00:41:07.023 --> 00:41:13.023
To file. Although some of these others.

00:41:12.473 --> 00:41:25.473
This one I think actually creates. Files. Not well documented. I certainly don't want to go through to at the moment, but we'll do that in our next debug system.

00:41:24.173 --> 00:41:35.173
So you can see how the tests develop here relate to the operations we want to carry out. So well done, Renault 4.

00:41:34.423 --> 00:41:50.423
Bringing that up. So we have 2 main libraries for Amy the general Amy Lib, which you generally won't do very much with, and the Emmy climate library, where you can develop it.

00:41:51.524 --> 00:42:01.524
Researching the climate literature. I should also mention that we have

00:42:08.774 --> 00:42:22.774
I get papers here. So Iish as recently updated PIE get papers. And, so there's a repository here about, get papers.

00:42:24.524 --> 00:42:30.524
And. Somewhere or other we should have a

00:42:45.374 --> 00:42:47.374
One for dockanellas.

00:42:54.573 --> 00:42:56.573
Yeah, we are.

00:42:56.373 --> 00:43:06.373
So this is docanalysis. Dark analysis. Doesn't have any, tests on it.

00:43:05.473 --> 00:43:14.473
It should do. And that's something which may be some of you can help.

00:43:13.823 --> 00:43:21.823
By writings and tests for. Dock analysis. Very well. Got very good documentation.

00:43:21.523 --> 00:43:35.523
But I don't think it's got any tests. And so having tests is valuable because it's a way of making sure that it continues to work.

00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:42.675
Even if you do things like upgrade, Python and so forth. So does that.

00:43:42.023 --> 00:43:52.023
We've also got dictionaries in the system. I will mention Try and find them.

00:43:58.424 --> 00:44:00.424
See if they're not.

00:44:01.523 --> 00:44:14.523
So I just mentioned this. We got dictionaries here under CEV open we've got things like compounds and genus and plant parts and things like that.

00:44:13.574 --> 00:44:32.574
And there are other ones which we've created. Which will do things like poverty and goodness knows what we've got a lot of Dixon is a pretty the very variable in form and so on.

00:44:31.324 --> 00:44:49.324
And what we need to do is to come up with a good way of creating those dictionaries, rapidly, automating as much of the process as possible and then using them to search and classify the material.

00:44:44.023 --> 00:44:53.023
We've got and to understand it when we've read it.

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:59.324
So, Reno, thank you for that. Have we covered nearly everything?

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.940
Yes, we do.

00:45:02.773 --> 00:45:07.773
Good. Any questions from? Anyone.

00:45:10.373 --> 00:45:13.373
They can be as simple as possible, don't worry.

00:45:13.423 --> 00:45:15.423
Hmm.

00:45:19.524 --> 00:45:26.524
You understand all of it or your brain is completely frazzled because we've gone on for too long.

00:45:23.942 --> 00:45:27.942
Okay. Maybe they are tired enough.

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:42.524
And date. Absolutely. Okay, so let's make sure we know save things okay. We are going to we're going to close the recording 1st of all.

00:45:29.573 --> 00:45:31.573
Yes.

00:45:40.575 --> 00:45:42.575
It's not.

00:45:43.024 --> 00:45:44.024
Is that right?

00:45:44.173 --> 00:45:46.173
Yes.
