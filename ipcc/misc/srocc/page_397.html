Indeed, studies strongly agree on the importance of engaging local populations in both sustainable land and forest management. Meta-analyses in tropical regions that examined both forests in protected areas and community-managed forests suggest that deforestation rates are lower, with less variation in deforestation rates presenting in community-managed forests compared to protected forests (Porter-Bolland et al. 2012). This suggests that consideration of the social and economic needs of local human populations is vital in preventing forest degradation (Ward et al. 2018). However, while disciplines such as ethnopedology seek to record and understand how local people perceive, classify and use soil, and draw on that information to inform its management (Barrera-Bassols and Zinck 2003), links with climate change and its impacts (perceived and actual) are not generally considered.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="304.39" top="531.42"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.11; y0: 531.42; y1: 541.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="531.42" x1="304.39">1.8.3 Reducing deforestation and forest degradation and increasing afforestation </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.96" top="495.52"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 495.52; y1: 505.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="495.52" x1="312.96">Improved stewardship of forests through reduction or avoidance of deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks can all contribute to land-based natural climate solutions (Angelsen et al. 2018; Sonwa et al. 2011; Griscom et al. 2017).
