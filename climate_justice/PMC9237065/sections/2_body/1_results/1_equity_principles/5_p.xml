Allocating the burdens of reaching the 2030 reduction goal should be compatible with countries securing the sufficiency level of wellbeing of all residents. Reaching the poverty line serves as proxy for reaching this critical level of wellbeing. So understood, the equality principle reflects the sufficiency principle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (abbreviated <italic>E1-basic-needs</italic>). As an alternative to the sufficientarian interpretation, the equality principle can be specified as the goal of all countries converging on the same equal-per capita emission level in 2030 (defined as <italic>E2-ES-EPC</italic> or <italic>E3-Full-EPC</italic>, indicating convergence of effort-sharing (ES) or all (full) emissions). Then, from 2030 onwards the EU 27 will pursue the 2050 reduction of net-zero without grandfathering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, that is, without prolonging the inequality of the status-quo levels of emissions into the transformation period.</p>
