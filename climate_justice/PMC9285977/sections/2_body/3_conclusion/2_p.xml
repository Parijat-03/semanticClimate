<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The literature on cities and climate change is lively and has delivered both theoretical and practical insights, from mapping the drivers of climate action to examining the effectiveness of different forms of action. The relationship between local and global politics and the increasingly visible unintended impacts of climate action have become salient themes of this body of literature during the last decade and how these themes have been expressed in the two waves of research has been shaped by the perceived need to respond to the demands of the international climate regime. Here we explore five areas of research: four that already sustain a consolidated body of literature, and a fifth which we think is vital to develop new research. As the sections above show, each area of research opens up unanswered questions. From our vantage point, the key gaps that remain unexplored are mostly related to the need to examine the interactions between multiple policies not only within a municipal plan but also in relation to various actors in the city, who play increasingly undefined roles in delivering climate action.</p>
