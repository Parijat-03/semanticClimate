<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The state is currently using CES to designate communities as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; and therefore included in the GGRF&#8217;s disadvantaged community budget. The results of this study highlight the strengths and limitations of this approach to guiding equity-oriented adaptation. First, our analysis demonstrates that one strength of using vulnerability indices is in highlighting which communities might benefit from additional investment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Vulnerability indices in adaptation work have been shown to provide transparent, comparative analysis in resiliency building work [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This study also demonstrates their value as a starting point for further investigation, a finding consistent with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0240841.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Second, the single index that is heat specific, HHAI, selects 653 different communities compared to the current index used by the state (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g002">2</xref>). Third, the state has successfully allocated the majority (51.1%) of its heat-related adaptations to communities that are vulnerable under all three indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The state passed AB 1550 as a response to concerns about using CES alone to allocate GGRF monies. However, our results demonstrate that this policy has only modestly changed the allocation of CCI-funded projects among California&#8217;s communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The state has successfully directed the majority of CCI-funded heat-related adaptations to its most vulnerable communities, but current methods for broadening vulnerability designations among low income communities have had little effect.</p>
