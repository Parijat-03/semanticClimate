<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As evidenced by the themes yielded from this review, nursing has a global role which requires an urgent response in public health challenges locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. Further nursing workforce development globally is poised to expand the role of nurses in addressing the current pandemic and future potential pandemics. Further education of nurses about these public health challenges must be incorporated in formal nursing education programs as well as continuing education programs. The themes that emerged in our review offer opportunities for the future of public health nursing; these themes may also further support a framework of public health and necessary tenets that are critical in addressing the intersection of COVID&#8208;19 and climate change. Understanding human&#8208;environmental impacts are important in the current pandemic and offering insight for the emergence of future pandemics and the climate crisis. A community and a global perspective are integral to engaging in a public health approach to this dual crisis. Environmental impacts, including the built environment are important for policy and advocacy efforts by public health professionals. Professional associations and specialty organizations should fully engage in advancing knowledge about the current and possibly future pandemics and the emerging current climate crisis and associated health consequences. Recommendations for future scholarship and research should focus on the critical role of public health nursing in addressing emerging infectious diseases and potential pandemics and further study of health consequences of climate change within the lens of public health nursing.</p>
