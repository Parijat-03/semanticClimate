Integrating the need to protect and enhance ecosystem services from climate risks, enhancing resilience of rural livelihoods by building the diversity in farming systems and food production. Another is building effective means of coordinating actions and building community cohesiveness. Reducing exposure to risks, for example by ensuring the resilience of rural infrastructure to climate shocks in order to support stable growth in agricultural value chains and employment opportunities is another example, as is expanding the capacity to cope with adverse events.</p>
