Land degradation of drylands is covered in Chapter&#160;3. After providing de&#64257;nitions and the context (Section&#160;4.1) we proceed with a&#160;theoretical explanation of the different processes of land degradation and how they are related to climate and to climate change, where possible (Section&#160;4.2). Two sections are devoted to a&#160;systematic assessment of the scienti&#64257;c literature on status and trend of land degradation (Section&#160;4.3) and projections of land degradation (Section&#160;4.4). Then follows a&#160;section where we assess the impacts of climate change mitigation options, bioenergy and land-based technologies for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), on land degradation (Section&#160;4.5). The ways in which land degradation can impact on climate and climate change are assessed in Section&#160;4.6. The impacts of climate-related land degradation on human and natural systems are assessed in Section&#160;4.7. The remainder of the chapter assesses land degradation mitigation options based on the concept of sustainable land management: avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation (Section&#160;4.8), followed by a&#160;presentation of eight illustrative case studies of land degradation and remedies (Section&#160;4.9). The chapter ends with a&#160;discussion of the most critical knowledge gaps and areas for further research (Section&#160;4.10).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="242.7" top="399.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 399.42; y1: 409.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="399.42" x1="242.7">1.1.2 Perspectives of land degradation</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="375.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.06; y0: 375.52; y1: 385.02; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="375.52" x1="313.23">Land degradation has accompanied humanity at least since the widespread adoption of agriculture during Neolithic time, some 10,000 to&#160;7,500&#160;years ago (Dotterweich 2013; Butzer 2005; Dotterweich 2008) and the associated population increase (Bocquet-Appel 2011).

While the development of agriculture (cropping and animal husbandry) underpinned the development of civilisations, political institutions and prosperity, farming practices led to conversion of forests and grasslands to farmland, and the heavy reliance on domesticated annual grasses for our food production meant that soils started to deteriorate through seasonal mechanical disturbances (Turner et al. 1990; Steffen et al. 2005; Ojima et al. 1994; Ellis et al. 2013). More recently, urbanisation has signi&#64257;cantly altered ecosystems (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;4&#160;in Chapter&#160;2).

The elusiveness of the concept in combination with the dif&#64257;culties of measuring and monitoring land degradation at global and regional scales by extrapolation and aggregation of empirical studies at local scales, such as the Global Assessment of Soil Degradation database (GLASOD) (Sonneveld and Dent 2009) contributed to con&#64258;icting views. The con&#64258;icting views were not con&#64257;ned to science only, but also caused tension between the scienti&#64257;c understanding of land degradation and policy (Andersson et al. 2011; Behnke and Mortimore 2016; Grainger 2009; Toulmin and Brock 2016). Another weakness of many land degradation studies is the exclusion of the views and experiences of the land users, whether farmers or forest-dependent communities (Blaikie and Brook&#64257;eld 1987; Fairhead and Scoones 2005; Warren 2002; Andersson et al. 2011). More recently, the polarised views described above have been reconciled under the umbrella of Land Change Science, which has emerged as an interdisciplinary &#64257;eld aimed at examining the dynamics of land cover and land-use as a&#160;coupled human-environment system (Turner et al. 2007). A&#160;comprehensive discussion about concepts and different perspectives of land degradation was presented in Chapter&#160;2&#160;of the recent report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) on land degradation (Montanarella et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="339.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 339.59; y1: 349.09; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="339.59" x1="571.77">In summary, agriculture and clearing of land for food and wood products have been the main drivers of land degradation for millennia (</span><span style="x0: 326.36; x1: 330.94; y0: 315.59; y1: 325.09; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="326.36" y0="315.59" x1="383.37">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 383.37; x1: 386.01; y0: 315.59; y1: 325.09; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="383.37" y0="315.59" x1="571.79">).
