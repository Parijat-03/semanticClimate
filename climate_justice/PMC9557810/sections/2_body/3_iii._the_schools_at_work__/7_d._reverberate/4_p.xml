<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The notion of &#8220;reverberation&#8221; is widely applied in sound studies,<sup>(<xref rid="fn34-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">34</xref>)</sup> not only
with a physical but also a political meaning. In this context, to reverberate
means the putting-in-motion of resonance, to amplify diversity perspectives, to
grant them a dignity of attention and recognize their value and importance. As a
pedagogic practice, reverberating is led by learners as they synthesize their
own sense-making of how, for example, a transgender person experiences their
right to the city, while provoking further reflections that together build new
collective understandings, creating social proximity even in a context of
physical distance. As such, to reverberate sets off new possibilities to act
across spaces, temporalities and struggles that go beyond those curated by the
schools.</p>
