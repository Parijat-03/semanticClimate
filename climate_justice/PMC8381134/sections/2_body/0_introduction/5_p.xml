How do we transform the questions of climate adaptation/mitigation to those of climate justice? To begin with, there is a vital need to reveal the place-based stories of such negotiations that weave together both marginalized and elite subjects and institutions. This process highlights embodied experiences of climate-society relationships and how such relationships are part of a constellation of power. Furthermore, they act as a prism through which to view both the subjectivity of knowledge and the role of institutions like the IPCC in reproducing or challenging certain versions of reality (Livingston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). Building on this heuristic, in this essay, two early-career scholars, who work in the Himalayan region with issues of social-environmental change and environmental/climate justice, present their experiences of working with Himalayan communities and their engagements with the IPCC.</p>
