It also implies building stronger vertical and horizontal alliances among different actors to support these communities. For example, organizations such as the IOM, UNHCR, and OHCHR need to collaborate more with migrating individuals and communities as well as with national governments and scholars of refugee law, human rights law, geography, sociology, anthropology, and related disciplines. Similarly, organizations currently handling MR need to work closely with at risk communities, housing advocates, land use planners, geographers, climate activists, governments as well as agencies such as International Displacement and Monitoring Center (IDMC), and the Platform on Displacement Disaster (PDD). Attention to power relations within and across these alliances are important to ensure fairness and equity in decision making, planning, and outcomes.</p>
