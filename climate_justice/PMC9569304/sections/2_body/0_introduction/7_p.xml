There are many normative hurdles that have to be overcome from the point of accepting an abstract philosophical principle to implementing it. For example, there might be overruling considerations, or there might be motivational or practical feasibility constraints that make immediate implementation impossible. An important hurdle relating to implementation could be that the moral cost of enforcing the principle is too high and therefore the principle could only be justified as a pre-political or pre-institutional moral principle that people could (and morally should) take into account in their own deliberations, but not as an institutional principle. The distinction between abstract philosophical principles and the rules for implementing them is obviously very relevant for the Moral Equivalence Thesis, and this is only analyzed in this paper at the level of theoretical principles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> Is a solid critique of the Moral Equivalence Thesis at the level of abstract theoretical analysis possible?</p>
