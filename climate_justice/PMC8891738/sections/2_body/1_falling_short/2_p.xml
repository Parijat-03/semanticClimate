It was the first time that coal was mentioned in COP documents. Although the final language stalled, at the already infamous, &#8216;phasing down&#8217; coal instead of the initial &#8216;phasing out&#8217;, it was a turning point when the international community recognized the time for fossil fuels as a source of energy is up. Furthermore, Nigeria, India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Nepal made net-zero commitments. In total, 90% of the world&#8217;s economy is currently committed to net-zero.</p>
