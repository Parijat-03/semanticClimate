Many of the health issues addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00189-f002">Figure 2</xref> are related to chemical or biological contaminant exposure as an indirect result of climate change effects, including increasing temperatures and water quality and quantity concerns. For example, increased temperatures associated with climate change are expected to release volatile compounds that were previously trapped in water, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), exposing populations through ingestion or inhalation to these and possibly other carcinogenic toxicants [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, flooding may overburden water treatment facilities and waste lagoons from animal agriculture, exposing populations to pathogenic viruses and microorganisms. Flooding will also cause increased pesticide run-off and may introduce fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus into the water, creating harmful non-toxic and toxic algal blooms that may sicken or kill animals and people [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B80-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p>
