According to a Bruegel dataset, the overall allocations in submitted plans correspond well to the recovery policies recommended by Hepburn et al.: 11.41% for clean technologies and renewables, 9.92% for energy efficiency of buildings, 17.83% for sustainable transport, 11.38% for education and training to support digital skills and 7.05% for &#8216;other green&#8217; investments (Darvas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2021</xref>). A separate study of ten Member State plans found that 98% of &#8216;climate-relevant spending&#8217; (&#8364;240 billion) would reduce emissions (Vivid Economics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2021</xref>, 4). Many of the proposed reforms and investments tackle specific climate justice elements. For example, both Austria and Greece address energy poverty (Ibid), while Cyprus&#8217; plan explicitly identifies &#8216;[t]ackling energy poverty in households with disabled people&#8217; as a just transition measure (Republic of Cyprus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2021</xref>, 107, 139).</p>
