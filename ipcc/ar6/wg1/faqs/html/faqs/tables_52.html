      <td>Evidence from the distant past shows that some parts of the Earth system might take hundreds to thousands of\nyears to fully adjust to changes in climate. This means that some of the consequences of human-induced climate\nchange will continue for a very long time, even if atmospheric heat-trapping gas levels and global temperatures\nare stabilized or reduced in the future. This is especially true for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which\ngrow much more slowly than they retreat. If the current melting of these ice sheets continues for long enough,</td>

      <td>(Arctic and Antarctic). The Arctic is already warming faster than anywhere else (see FAQ 4.3). This is significant\nbecause these colder high latitudes are home to our two remaining ice sheets: Antarctica and Greenland. Ice\nsheets are huge reservoirs of frozen freshwater, built up by tens of thousands of years of snowfall. If they were\nto completely melt, the water released would raise global sea level by about 65 m. Understanding how these ice\nsheets are affected by warming of nearby ocean and atmosphere is therefore critically important. The Greenland\nand Antarctic ice sheets are already slowly responding to recent changes in climate, but it takes a long time\nfor these huge masses of ice to adjust to changes in global temperature. That means that the full effects of\na warming climate may take hundreds or thousands of years to play out. An important question is whether these\nchanges can eventually be reversed, once levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are stabilized or reduced</td>

      <td>caused by natural processes. During cooling phases, more and more ocean water is gradually deposited as\nsnowfall, causing ice sheets to grow and sea level to slowly decrease. During warming phases, the ice sheets\nmelt more quickly, resulting in more rapid rises in sea level (FAQ 9.1, Figure 1). Ice sheets build up very slowly\nbecause growth relies on the steady accumulation of falling snow that eventually compacts into ice. As the\nclimate cools, areas that can accumulate snow expand, reflecting back more sunlight that otherwise would keep\nthe Earth warmer. This means that, once started, glacial climates develop rapidly. However, as the climate cools,\nthe amount of moisture that the air can hold tends to decrease. As a result, even though glaciations begin quite\nquickly, it takes tens of thousands of years for ice sheets to grow to a point where they are in balance with the</td>

      <td>ice loss. For ice sheets that are mostly resting on bedrock above sea level &#8211; like the Greenland Ice Sheet &#8211; the main\nself-reinforcing loop that affects them is the &#8216;elevation&#8211;mass balance feedback&#8217; (FAQ 9.1, Figure 1, right). In this\nsituation, the altitude of the ice-sheet surface decreases as it melts, exposing the sheet to warmer air. The lowered\nsurface then melts even more, lowering it faster still, until eventually the whole ice sheet disappears. In places\nwhere the ice sheet rests instead on bedrock that is below sea level, and which also deepens inland, including\nmany parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, an important process called &#8216;marine ice sheet instability&#8217; is thought to drive\nrapid retreat (FAQ 9.1, Figure 1, left). This happens when the part of the ice sheet that is surrounded by sea water\nmelts. That leads to additional thinning, which in turn accelerates the motion of the glaciers that feed into these\nareas. As the ice sheet flows more quickly into the ocean, more melting takes place, leading to more thinning\nand even faster flow that brings ever-more glacier ice into the ocean, ultimately driving rapid deglaciation of</td>

These insights from the past imply that,\nif human-induced changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets continue for the rest of this century, it will\ntake thousands of years to reverse that melting, even if global air temperatures decrease within this or the next\ncentury. In this sense, these changes are therefore irreversible, since the ice sheets would take much longer to\nregrow than the decades or centuries for which modern society is able to plan.</td>
