![[fig2_5.png]]Figure 2.5 Total anthropogenic GHG emissions (Gt CO2eq yr-1) 1990-2019

CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes ([[FFI]]); net CO2 from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry ([[LULUCF]]); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3). 

Panel a: Aggregate GHG emission trends by groups of gases reported in Gt CO2eq converted based on global warming potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. 

Panel b: Waterfall diagrams juxtaposes GHG emissions for the most recent year 2019 in CO2 equivalent units using GWP-100 values from the IPCCâ€™s Second, Fifth, and Sixth Assessment Report, respectively. Error bars show the associated uncertainties at a 90% confidence interval. 

Panel c: individual trends in CO2-FFI, CO2-AFOLU, CH4, N2O and F-gas emissions for the period 1990-2019, normalised to 1 in 1990.
