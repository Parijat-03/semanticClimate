Global corporate food chains now account for three-quarters of all global trade (Schwab and Malleret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>: 72), constituting &#8216;roughly 30&#8211;50 percent of the food systems in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, and 20 percent of the food systems in Africa and South Asia&#8217; (Bello <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>: 5). And food corporations &#8216;command billions more in infrastructure [beyond] multibillion-dollar markets for their goods&#8217; (Philpott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>: 181&#8211;2)&#8212;including $540bn <italic>annually</italic> in global subsidies, &#8216;on track to soar to $1.8tn (&#163;1.3tn) a year by 2030&#8217; (Carrington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). Ultimately, such infrastructure has the capacity to &#8216;lock-in&#8217; governing structures, foreshadowing override of the CFS in the name of (global) &#8216;food system transformation&#8217; geared to SDG 2030. This would formally complete corporate capture, ending the decade-long juxtaposition of civil society and private mechanisms in the CFS, addressed below.</p>
