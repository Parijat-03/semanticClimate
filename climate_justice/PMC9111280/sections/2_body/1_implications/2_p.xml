<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The clear finding from this work is that the human waste heat term is not a negligible contributor to the UHI. There has been scholarly uncertainty about the role of the anthropogenic term relative to the latent heat or thermal surface terms. Scholars like Fan and Sailor&#160;(<xref rid="grl63961-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) have consistently noted that the waste heat or anthropogenic release term is a significant contributor to the urban energy balance and must not be ignored.</p>
