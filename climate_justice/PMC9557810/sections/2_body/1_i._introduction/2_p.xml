learning; not as a practice of individual freedom but as a collective way to
transform the world we live in. In this paper, we look at sites of learning other
than the academy, where paradise can be created. We reflect collectively on the

of the Habitat International Coalition (HIC) across Latin America, and on their
capacity to activate critical agency to confront urban inequalities and advance
habitat-related human rights.</p>
