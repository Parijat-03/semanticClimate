We started out from the Moral Equivalence Thesis, which denies that procreation has a special status in matters of distributive justice and entails that there is no morally significant difference between individuals laying claim to natural goods via overconsumption and individuals laying claim to them via procreation. Two arguments have been advanced against the Moral Equivalence Thesis. The first, the capabilitarian argument, shows that the Moral Equivalence Thesis relies on a specific underlying theory of distributive justice, namely equality of resources. The capabilitarian argument is not sufficient to reject the Moral Equivalence Thesis but does show that the acceptance of the thesis rests on an endorsement of resource egalitarianism, which is controversial. The second argument, the argument from human self-understanding, has more far-reaching consequences, since it shows why procreation and overconsumption are not morally equivalent. Procreation, and the closely related practice of parenting, are part of how we understand the human species; being given the opportunity to engage in that practice is needed as a precondition for understanding ourselves as humans. The capability of procreation is thus needed to avoid dehumanization, whereas this is not the case for overconsumption. Thus, the Moral Equivalence Thesis breaks down.</p>
