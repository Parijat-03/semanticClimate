<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">With respect to the UHRI in May, the hottest month of the year, we found several vulnerable groups such as children, agricultural workers, and larger sized households to be significantly overrepresented in wards with greater heat exposure, after controlling for spatial clustering, population density, and other relevant factors. With regard to social vulnerability related to economic status, our multivariable analysis revealed that households with assets and electricity are significantly underrepresented in neighborhoods with greater heat exposure in May. This suggests that households with fewer resources or reduced capacity to mitigate heat-related risks (e.g., via home air-conditioning) face disproportionately higher heat exposure. A study in the U.S. also found that socioeconomically disadvantaged residents faced significantly greater exposure to urban heat [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The prevalence of agricultural workers in wards with higher pre-monsoon UHRI is especially noteworthy, since employment in outdoor labor is a key risk factor in heat exposure [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-04800" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that the proportion of agricultural workers was significantly and positively related to UHRI in May, the need to consider heat stress experienced by agricultural workers becomes important in the case of Delhi.</p>
