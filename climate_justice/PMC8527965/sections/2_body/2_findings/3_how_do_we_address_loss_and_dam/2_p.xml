This was emphasised by the participants who centred discussions on good practice around minimising and addressing NELD through biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and restoration. Specific examples included the planting of mangroves, locally managed marine area network initiatives, and clean up campaigns, re-afforestation projects and &#8220;the legal status in national policy for nature and natural components&#8221; (participants #6, #23 and #4, 2020). These strategies simultaneously protect features of cultural heritage, Indigenous knowledge and health through helping to preserve and maintain people-ecology interactions and the socio-ecological system.</p>
