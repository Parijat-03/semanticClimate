<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0230">This exercise of fully recognising the ways in which the mobilities of different individuals and groups are bound to those of others and to the non-human environment in complex, multi-scalar and situated ways opens up new paths for <italic>taking responsibility</italic>. Through participatory processes researchers, activists, planners, citizens and others can on the one hand address and mitigate the identified forms of sufferings and on the other aid in the satisfaction of previously ignored needs in ways that fully respect others' personhood and dignity. Calling into question extant socio-technical, politico-economic and energetic configurations that enable some movements whilst frustrating others is an integral part of this mode of taking responsibility. This demands more than asking what is the right or wrong approach to the planning and design of mobilities, developing a framework for analysis and planning in which the central question becomes how to &#8216;care&#8217; optimally for the mobility needs of the most vulnerable and for the non-human environment in an ongoing, collective and reflexive process. This might lead, at least in some cities and territories, to broad support for the view that further expanding aviation, automated vehicles and other forms of mobility that primarily benefit the better-off is less attractive and ethical than supporting forms of mobility that help to fulfil everybody's needs and cause less human and non-human suffering, now and in future, nearby and far away.</p>
