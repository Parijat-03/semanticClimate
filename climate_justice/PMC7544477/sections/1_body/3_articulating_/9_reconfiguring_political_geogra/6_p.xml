<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0250">At the centre was the ethical problem of a judge's injunction enabling a company to clear Indigenous people and others from roads on land never ceded by Indigenous people in the first place. Amid deceptive news media reportage that helped to distort public debate on harm, political geographies of care in the courtroom have thus become about reclaiming, pointing to more than inconsistencies and omissions under settler-colonial law itself, but more importantly, taking seriously the foundational point that theorizing pipeline governance ultimately necessities engaging with Indigenous modes of care and jurisdiction over development (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">McCreary &amp; Turner, 2018</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Asch, 2019</xref>). Being an ethnographer in the court gallery inexorably leads to reflecting on what jurisdiction a settler-colonial court actually has on land that was stolen from Indigenous people, and that remains stolen. It also leads to an interrogation of affect &#8211; including how <italic>harms</italic> are felt, what these harms do to the future, and why <italic>these</italic> harms are not guiding &#8216;injunctions&#8217;. Perhaps most importantly of all, attending the courtroom dramas in these injunction hearings raises the question of what it would mean to <italic>start</italic> the conversation from the point of view of Indigenous laws &#8211; profoundly different premises for grounding understandings of harm and care.</p>
