Such efforts could cultivate &#8220;response-ability&#8221; (Haraway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>)&#8212;our &#8220;capacities to respond&#8221; rooted in an awareness of the interdependence of humans with each other and with nonhuman beings, an ethics of co-creation and care not confined by checklists of correct behavior or individualist market logic.
