<p>The most significant power imbalance we face is between humans and the environment. The Book Religions &#8211; the Jews, Christians, and Muslims &#8211; share a creation myth of humans being made &#8216;in God&#8217;s image&#8217; and commanded to have &#8216;dominion over&#8217; nature. Were not the frogs and toads and elks and bears not made in God&#8217;s image as well? Were they left out of the sacred domain, a domain they inhabit in all indigenous, so&#8208;called &#8216;heathen&#8217; cultures, and in the &#8216;zoological cathedrals&#8217; of our dreams, as James Hillman called them? (Hillman&#160;<xref rid="joap12675-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, p. 71). Jung said a task for Christianity was to come to terms with the tortures it has perpetuated upon our indigenous &#8216;heathen&#8217; ancestors. A supreme challenge he gave us was to unite our cultured side with the &#8216;the two&#8208;million&#8208;year&#8208;old man within&#8217;, what can be called the &#8216;indigenous one within&#8217;.</p>
