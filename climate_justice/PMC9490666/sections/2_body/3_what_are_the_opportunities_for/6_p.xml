The Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF) and My Green Laboratory platforms offer evidence-based guidance and online frameworks for laboratory personnel and researchers to implement actions that limit waste and reduce the carbon footprint of laboratory work, such as switching ultra-low temperature freezers from &#8211;80 to &#8211;70&#176;C.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr"/><sup>&#8211;</sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> It is estimated that the LEAF platform saves on average the equivalent of 2.9 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per laboratory per year.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
