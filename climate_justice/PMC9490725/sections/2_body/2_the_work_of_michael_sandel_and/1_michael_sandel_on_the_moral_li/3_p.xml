Sandel also draws on important work on the questions of agency and inequality in markets as well as commodification and influencing social and political norms by authors such as Kanbur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>) on obnoxious markets and Roth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2007</xref>) on repugnant markets. The reason for using Sandel&#8217;s work as the primary analytical lens for this paper is its strength in problem description, focus on justice, and the link to other work on the ethics of emission trading.</p>
