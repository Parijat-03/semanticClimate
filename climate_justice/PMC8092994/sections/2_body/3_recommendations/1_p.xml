As noted earlier, these programs are predominantly focused on offering assistance and relief to homeowners, and renters are predominantly left out. However, as noted by Paine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>) and others, the majority of individuals at risk in the floodplains of the USA are renters, and predominantly non-white. Many at-risk individuals and families are excluded from the safety net that these programs are set up to provide.</p>
