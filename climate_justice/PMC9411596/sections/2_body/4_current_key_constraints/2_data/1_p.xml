However, the necessary data are often difficult to access and use&#8212;e.g., climate data because of data volumes and domain-specific data formats. Data can also be complex and expensive to generate, such as exposure/vulnerability/policy datasets, and contain inherent uncertainties because of undetermined and unpredictable elements. In addition, as CRAs must be periodically updated, it can be challenging to acquire the necessary data because data providers may not update datasets with the required frequency or spatio-temporal resolution.</p>
