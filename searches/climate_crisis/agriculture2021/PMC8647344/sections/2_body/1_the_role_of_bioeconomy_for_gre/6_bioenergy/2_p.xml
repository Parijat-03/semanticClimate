<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0345">The current energy system mostly depends on fossil fuels, having an enormous impact on the environment and global economies. European countries are significantly dependent on energy imports (mainly oil, natural gas, and coal) as 58% of EU-28 energy was imported in 2018 compared to 47% imported in 2000 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequently, the need for energy security and local resilience through low carbon solutions is prominent. Renewable energy from solar power and wind are intrinsically variable in time and available. Although it cannot replace thoroughly conventional fuels, bioenergy can provide stand-alone energy generation that will smooth the peaks related to the other forms of variable renewable energies. Through bioliquids and biofuels, it is nowadays strongly regarded as an ideal alternative for aviation, marine, and heavy-duty transports, sectors with fewer decarbonization options (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Panoutsou et al., 2021</xref>) and offers system energy balancing services, as in district heating and electricity systems (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Arasto et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, facilitating energy security within the framework of the circular bioeconomy can be achieved through investments that prioritize local bio-based value chains (e.g., biofuel production processes) and promote supply from domestic regions (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Lange et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
