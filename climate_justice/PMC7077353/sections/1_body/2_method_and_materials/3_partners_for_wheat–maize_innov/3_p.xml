<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The RDRS, with funding from the European Union and other NGOs, established a Union Federation &#8211; an outreach platform specifically to reach women farmers &#8211; in Kalipara in 2013. This is just one of many Union Federations established by RDRS across its intervention area. RDRS works through the Union Federation to direct agricultural innovations specifically to women. The Kalipara Union Federation provides courses in income-generation activities like vegetable growing, sewing and hobbies such as the harmonica, and it holds regular meetings where women members can share their experiences of new technologies, including wheat&#8211;maize innovations. At the time of study the Kalipara Union Federation had a membership of 826 individuals, of whom 766 were women and 60 were men. All men members were Santals (7% of the membership). Santal women comprised 55 per cent (422 individuals) of the membership; and Bengali Muslim/Hindu &#8211; 38 per cent (344 individuals). Members were derived from Kalipara village, as well as surrounding villages. Since the Kalipara Union Federation building is physically located close to the homes of Santal people, this has promoted Santal participation as members and in the leadership. Currently, the president of the Kalipara Union Federation is a Santal woman, Joytee (a pseudonym), who was elected by Muslim and Santal women for her strong leadership skills, proven innovation expertise and personal motivation.</p>
