The three circles on the left (Adaptability, Interdisciplinarity, and Engageability) demonstrate the three themes that emerged in the data analysis. Under each theme, tri-level sub-categories (micro-level, mezzo-level, and macro-level, the three circles on the right) were developed to provide detailed supportive information from both authors&#8217; critical reflections. These themes and subthemes are organized in a circle around the vital concept of GSW in this article, indicating the interconnections among these themes and subthemes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="healthcare-10-01245-g001" position="float"/></fig>
