<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We built a base of approximately 150 oral histories of Hurricane Maria and its effect on the people of Puerto Rico. In looking at these oral histories, I realized that their overarching message when we read them together as a polyphonic history of the disaster is community response to climate disaster; the stories again and again celebrate what the neighbor does, what the person down the street does, what the church does, what the people gather together to do&#8212;to feed, to shelter, to provide clean drinking water. Again and again, the oral histories talk about the limitations or abject failures of relief efforts coming from federal and local government levels.</p>
