Temperatures over West Africa have increased over the last 50 2 years (Mouhamed et al., 2013; Niang et al., 2014) with a spatially variable gradual warming reaching 0.5&#176;C 3 per decade from 1983 through 2010 (Sylla et al., 2016). West Africa has also experienced a decrease in the 4 number of cool nights as well as more frequent warm days and warm spells (Mouhamed et al., 2013; Ringard 5 et al., 2016). Similarly, East Africa has experienced a significant increase in temperature since the beginning 6 of the early 1980s (Anyah and Qiu, 2012) with an increase in seasonal mean temperature. Over South Africa, 7 positive trends were found in the annual mean, maximum and minimum temperatures for 1960&#8211;2003 in all 8 seasons, except for the central interior (Kruger and Shongwe, 2004; Zhou et al., 2010; Collins, 2011; Kruger 9 and Sekele, 2013; MacKellar et al., 2014), where minimum temperatures have decreased significantly 10 (MacKellar et al., 2014). Inland southern Africa, minimum temperatures have increased more rapidly 11 relative to maximum temperatures (New et al., 2006). In the recent years Africa experienced hotter, longer 12 and more extensive heat waves than in the last two decades of the 20th century (Russo et al., 2016). 13 14 There is a general decrease in annual total rainfall over Africa (Mouhamed et al., 2013). Most areas of the 15 African continent lack enough observational data to draw conclusions about trends in annual precipitation 16 over the past century. In addition, many regions of Africa have discrepancies between different observed 17 precipitation data sets according to (Sylla et al., 2013; Panitz et al., 2014). A statistically significant (95% 18 confidence level) decrease in rainfall and the number of rainy days is reported in autumn over central and 19 north-eastern parts of South Africa in spring and summer during the period of 1960&#8211;2010 (MacKellar et al., 20 2014). Central Africa has experienced a significant decrease in total precipitation, which is likely associated 21 with a significant decrease of the length of the maximum number of consecutive wet days (Aguilar et al., 22 2009). Furthermore, rainfall decreased significantly in the Horn of Africa (Tierney et al., 2015) and more 23 pronounced during the long raining season March to May (Lyon and Dewitt, 2012; Viste et al., 2013; Rowell 24 et al., 2015). Over mountainous areas significant increases are found in the number of rain days around the 25 southern Drakensberg in spring and summer during the period of 1960&#8211;2010 (MacKellar et al., 2014). 26 Similarly, southern West Africa is observed to have had more intense rainfall from 1950 to 2014 during the 27 second rainy season of September&#8211;November (Nkrumah et al., 2019) and throughout the raining season over 28 the Sahel region within the period (Panthou et al., 2014, 2018b, 2018a; Sanogo et al., 2015; Gaetani et al., 29 2017; Taylor et al., 2017; Biasutti, 2019) in the last two decades (1980-2010). 30 31 Temperature increases over Africa in the 20th century can be attributed due to the strong evidence of a 32 continent-wide anthropogenic signal in the warming (Hoerling et al., 2006; Min and Hense, 2007; Stott et al., 33 2010, 2011; IPCC, 2013). More specifically over West Africa, higher temperature increases are due to the 34 relatively small natural climate variability in the region that generates narrow climate bounds which can be 35 easily surpassed by relatively small climate changes (IPCC, 2013b). Warming over North Africa is due to 36 natural (internal) variability (Barkhordarian et al., 2012), which is in turn attributed largely to the North 37 Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Knippertz et al., 2003). Over southern Africa there is a strong link between 38 ENSO and droughts (Meque and Abiodun, 2015). The drying trends in parts of Africa during each monsoon 39 season is attributable to oceanic influences where air-sea interactions have been most relevant (Hoerling et 40 al., 2006). In particular, they demonstrated that the drying over the Sahel can be attributed to warming of the 41 South Atlantic SST and southern African drying as a response to Indian Ocean warming (Hoerling et al., 42 2006; Dai, 2011). 43 44 The enhanced rainfall intensity in the last two decades over the Sahel is associated with increased 45 greenhouse gases suggesting an anthropogenic influence (Biasutti, 2019). In the last decade, the changes in 46 the timing of onset and cessation over Africa have been linked to changes in the progression of the tropical 47 rain-band and the Saharan Heat Low (Dunning et al., 2018; Wainwright et al., 2019). Over East Africa, the 48 drying trend is associated with an anthropogenic-forced relatively rapid warming of Indian Ocean SSTs 49 (Williams and Funk, 2011; Hoell et al., 2017); a shift to warmer SSTs over the western tropical Pacific and 50 cooler SSTs over the central and eastern tropical Pacific (Lyon and Dewitt, 2012); multidecadal variability of 51 SSTs in the tropical Pacific, with cooling in the east and warming in the west (Lyon, 2014); and the 52 strengthening of the 200-mb easterlies (Liebmann et al., 2017). However, decadal natural variability from 53 SST variations over the Pacific Ocean has also been associated with the drying trend of the East Africa 54 (Wang et al., 2014; Hoell et al., 2017). Moreover, later onset and earlier cessation of Eastern Africa rainfall 55 </span></div></body></html>
