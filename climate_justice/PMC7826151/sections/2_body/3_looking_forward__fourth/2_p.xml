These kinds of commitments can be traced to a cluster of ideas that emerged in the science education research literature, often in the context of school science curriculum, including the following: nature of science perspectives; science, technology, society, and environment relationships; socio-scientific issues; and socially acute questions. These ideas are slowly finding their way into the museum world in direct response to the long-established practice of exhibiting uncontested facts and truths of science (Hine &amp; Medvecky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). For example, in international science education conferences, strands related to informal science education have emerged (e.g., The <italic>Science Learning in Informal Context Strand</italic>, within the National Association for Research in Science Teaching) allowing for interesting connections and academic discussions between museum professionals and science education researchers. Additionally, we note the rise of informal science education journals where conversations about formal and informal science education are taking place (consider the <italic>International Journal of Science Education Part B</italic>, originating from the <italic>International Journal of Science Education</italic>, or the special issue dedicated to <italic>Informal Learning in Science</italic> [2006] in the <italic>Canadian Journal of Science</italic>, <italic>Mathematics and Technology Education</italic>)<italic>.</italic></p>
