<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the <italic toggle="yes">action-oriented response</italic> theme, commenters referenced the
model in their comments to justify when, why, and by whom an action needs to be
taken to curb the spread of the virus. For example, commenters ascribed to the
government the task of implementing aggressive measures as early as possible to
slow down the spread of the virus, one commenter wrote &#8220;As shown on the graphs
very early intervention is absolutely essential. Everything possible to do must
be done if that means closing schools, public gatherings, etc..&#8221; Other
commenters also proposed that society should take the necessary measures moving
forward to avoid infecting more people. For example, a commenter suggests,
&#8220;Great article and the model helps to explain what is going on. Work from home
if you can. Clean your hands-a lot. Go out just once a day, if needed, to get
supplies.&#8221; It is worth noting that irrespective of the type of ascribed
responsibility or action, models in the sampled predictive journalism articles
remain the main focal point of the comments requesting to take action in
response to the pandemic. Next, we elaborate on the types of actions commenters
ascribed to domestic and global actors.</p>
