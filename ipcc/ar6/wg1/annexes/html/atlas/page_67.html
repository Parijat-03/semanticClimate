Significant warming trends have been found for most of Central America and the 20 Caribbean (Planos Guti&#233;rrez et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2016a; Hidalgo et al., 2017; Cavazos et al., 2019), with 21 significant warming between 0.3&#176;C and 0.4&#176;C per decade for most of the region, but cooling trends have 22 been detected by Hidalgo et al. (2017) in part of Honduras and northern Panama.  23 24 Changes in mean precipitation rates are less consistent and long-term trends are generally weak. Small 25 positive trends were observed in the total annual precipitation, daily intensity, maximum number of 26 consecutive dry days, and episodes of heavy rains (Stephenson et al., 2014). In the Central America Isthmus 27 region, trends in annual precipitation are generally non-significant, with the exception of small significant 28 positive trends reported by Hidalgo et al. (2017) for Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama. Planos Guti&#233;rrez et 29 al. (2012) used a local gridded dataset based on 900 rain gauges for Cuba and found small non-significant 30 wet trends. Jones et al. (2016a) reported an increase of positive annual precipitation anomalies for the 31 Caribbean for the 1979&#8211;2012 period as a consequence of the rainfall increase during the rainy period. Local 32 high-resolution surface air temperature and precipitation datasets were used by Hidalgo et al. (2017) to study 33 climate variability in the Central American isthmus. It was found that the 1970&#8211;1999 trends in precipitation 34 are generally non-significant. 35 36 Figure Atlas.37: shows regional trends in temperature and precipitation for the recent past (1980&#8211;2014), 37 showing a consistent warming in the whole region reaching 0.5&#176;C per decade in Mexico and southern Baja 38 California. Significant but smaller warming (0.2&#176;C) is also detected in the Yucatan Peninsula, the Guatemala 39 Pacific coastal region and the Caribbean and the Bahamas, in agreement with Planos Guti&#233;rrez et al. (2012) 40 who investigated trends in the Cuban climate using a network of 11 local surface meteorological stations for 41 the 1951&#8211;2008 period and of Jones et al. (2016b) who analysed CRU TS-3.1 data for the Caribbean for the 42 1979&#8211;2012 period. In the case of precipitation, there is a large regional variability and no consensus on 43 significant trends from the three global gridded datasets, in agreement with the finding reported above with 44 local data. 45 46 A significant positive correlation between precipitation rates in the Caribbean and the AMO index was found 47 by Enfield et al. (2001). A similar result was found in southern Mexico in the MSD region  (M&#233;ndez and 48 Maga&#241;a, 2010; Cavazos et al., 2019). On the other hand, ENSO favours wet conditions in Mexico during 49 summers of low Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and during winters of high PDO. Cooler conditions are 50 favoured during La Ni&#241;a summers and El Ni&#241;o winters, regardless of the PDO phase, while summers with 51 high PDO and El Ni&#241;o condition favour warmer temperature. In the Pacific coast of the Central America 52 Isthmus, the MSD intensity and magnitude are correlated with the Ni&#241;o 3.4 and CLLJ indices in stations, so 53 that warm anomalies in the Ni&#241;o 3.4 region correspond to an enhanced CLLJ and a drier MSD (Maldonado 54 et al., 2016). Positive trends in the duration of the MSD have been found in this region over the past four 55 </span></div></body></html>
