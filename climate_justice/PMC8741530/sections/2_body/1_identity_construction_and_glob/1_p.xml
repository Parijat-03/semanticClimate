Identity is not pre-given but socially constructed and always in a process of constructing and reconstructing (Wendt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1999</xref>). In this study, a state&#8217;s foreign policy discourses and practices are regarded as a process of constructing its international identity (Messari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>; Wendt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1999</xref>). Identity is sustained by social interactions and a state has to seek recognitions from others so that its identity can be secured and it can maintain a relatively stable sense of Self (Wendt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1999</xref>).</p>
