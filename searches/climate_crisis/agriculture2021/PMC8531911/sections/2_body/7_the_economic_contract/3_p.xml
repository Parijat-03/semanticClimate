At the time, Director-General Renato Ruggiero characterized formation of the WTO as &#8216;writing the constitution of a single global economy&#8217; (Ruggiero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1996</xref>). The long-term consequences have materialized as a process of &#8216;de-territorialization&#8217; of food production and circulation. It is symbolized by dumping of artificially cheapened grains, global retailer monopolies, land grabbing, excessive agro-exporting, and value-chaining farmers. The consolidating capital logic threatens sovereignty, rural dweller livelihoods, and ecological balance on a world scale. States facilitated this logic, signing on to WTO liberalization rules subjecting them to international capital mobility and rising competitive economic relations. In this moment, the international peasant coalition, led by La V&#237;a Campesina, had the foresight and frontline experience to propose &#8216;food sovereignty&#8217; in opposition to deterritorialization.</p>
