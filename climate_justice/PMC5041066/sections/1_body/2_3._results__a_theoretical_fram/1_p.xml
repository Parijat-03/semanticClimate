Our definition of climate justice refers to distributional justice [<xref rid="B27-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] of the burden of adverse health effects, closely linked to the concept of environmental justice in the Public Health context. Environmental justice is based on the notion that environmental hazards and exposures disproportionately affect people with lower socio-economic capital, people of color, people in lower income regions or city districts, children, and people with less political power [<xref rid="B22-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Within the climate change and health discourse, the concept has been extended to climate justice [<xref rid="B6-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B20-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The latter similarly argues that the greatest risks of climate change consequences are shouldered by those who have contributed the least to these increased risks [<xref rid="B45-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While mostly discussed at an international level and focused on responsibilities of higher income nations with large greenhouse gas emission profiles towards lower income nations [<xref rid="B20-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B45-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], climate justice is also a local issue [<xref rid="B6-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With regard to public health, the possible adverse health effects caused by climatic change are also expected to be unequally distributed [<xref rid="B1-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
