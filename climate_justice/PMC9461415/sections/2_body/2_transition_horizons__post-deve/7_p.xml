Like a &#8220;ruin in the intellectual landscape,&#8221; as highlighted by the leading post-development scholar Wolfgang Sachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1992</xref>), it is time to &#8220;dismantle this mental structure.&#8221; So, to decolonize the imaginaries from development concepts, post-development theorists promote more plural ideas about well-being based on interculturality (Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2009</xref>). Instead of an unsustainable and also ineffective model of industrialization (due to their ignorance of the local, cultural, and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied), cross-cultural dialogues and interactions move beyond a passive acceptance of the multiple coexisting cultures to promote a set of relations grounded in values of mutual respect between indigenous and western ideals (Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2022</xref>).</p>
