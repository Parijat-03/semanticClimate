It&#160;includes variability that is internally generated within the climate system and variability that is driven by natural external factors. Natural variability is a major cause of year-to-year changes in global surface climate and can play a prominent role in trends over multiple years or even decades. But the influence of natural variability is typically small when considering trends over periods of multiple decades or longer. When estimated over the entire historical period (1850&#8211;2020), the contribution of natural variability to global surface warming of &#8211;0.23&#176;C to +0.23&#176;C is small compared to the warming of about 1.1&#176;C observed during the same period, which has been almost entirely attributed to the human influence.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.76" top="563.24"><span x0="69.02" y0="563.24" x1="539.76" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 563.24; y1: 572.24; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Paleoclimatic records (indirect measurements of climate that can extend back many thousands of years) and climate models all show that global surface temperatures have changed significantly over a wide range of time scales in the past.

Internal natural variability corresponds to a redistribution of energy within the climate system (for example via atmospheric circulation changes similar to those that drive the daily weather) and is most clearly observed as regional, rather than global, fluctuations in surface temperature. External natural variability can result from changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit, small variations in energy received from the sun, or from major volcanic eruptions. Although large orbital changes are related to global climate changes of the past, they operate on very long time scales (i.e.,&#160;thousands of years). As such, they have displayed very little change over the past century and have had very little influence on temperature changes observed over that period. On the other hand, volcanic eruptions can strongly cool the Earth, but this effect is short-lived and their influence on surface temperatures typically fades within a decade of the eruption.</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.82" top="401.27"><span x0="69.02" y0="401.27" x1="539.82" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.03; y0: 401.27; y1: 410.27; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">To understand how much of observed recent climate change has been caused by natural variability (a process referred to as attribution), scientists use climate model simulations. When only natural factors are used to force climate models, the resulting simulations show variations in climate on a wide range of time scales in response to volcanic eruptions, variations in solar activity, and internal natural variability. However, the influence of natural climate variability typically decreases as the time period gets longer, such that it only has mild effects on multi- decadal and longer trends (FAQ 3.2, Figure&#160;1).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="537.25" top="323.29"><span x0="69.02" y0="323.29" x1="537.25" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 74.52; y0: 323.29; y1: 332.29; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Consequently, over periods of a couple of decades or less, natural climate variability can dominate the human-induced surface warming trend &#8211; leading to periods with stronger or weaker warming, and sometimes even cooling (FAQ 3.2, Figure&#160;1, left and centre). Over longer periods, however, the effect of natural variability is relatively small (FAQ 3.2, Figure&#160;1, right). For instance, over the entire historical period (1850&#8211;2019), natural variability is estimated to have caused between &#8211;0.23&#176;C and +0.23&#176;C of the observed surface warming of about 1.1&#176;C. This means that the bulk of the warming has been almost entirely attributed to human activities, particularly emissions of greenhouse gases (FAQ 3.1).</span></div><div left="69.02" right="539.85" top="233.3"><span x0="69.02" y0="233.3" x1="539.85" style="x0: 69.02; x1: 75.52; y0: 233.3; y1: 242.3; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: PGERIU+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Another way to picture natural variability and human influence is to think of a person walking a dog. The path of the walker represents the human-induced warming, while their dog represents natural variability. Looking at global surface temperature changes over short periods is akin to focusing on the dog. The dog sometimes moves ahead of the owner and other times behind. This is similar to natural variability that can weaken or amplify warming on the short term. In both cases it is difficult to predict where the dog will be or how the climate will evolve in the near future. However, if we pull back and focus on the slow steady steps of the owner, the path of the dog is much clearer and more predictable, as it follows the path of its owner. Similarly, human influence on the climate is much clearer over longer time periods.</span></div></body></html>
