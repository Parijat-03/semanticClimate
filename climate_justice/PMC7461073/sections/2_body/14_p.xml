<bold>Mary:</bold> Climate change hits hardest the people who did the least to create the problem. Climate change, human rights, justice and equality are all inextricably linked &#8211; and must be at the heart of international diplomacy and governance arrangements. This means greater transparency, greater inclusion and greater action &#8211; not just words. At COP25, the chasm between the demands of young people, of scientists, of women, of vulnerable states, of indigenous peoples, of defenders of the environment and the pace and outcomes of the negotiations never felt wider. Diplomacy, led by the incoming COP26 presidency, needs to address this to convince the world of a positive outcome from the meetings next year.</p>
