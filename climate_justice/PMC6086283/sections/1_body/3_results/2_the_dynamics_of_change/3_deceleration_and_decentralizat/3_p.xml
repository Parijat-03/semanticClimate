<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par36">From a temporal perspective, the individual&#8217;s agency is adverse to the top-down acceleration process that is meant to control the &#8220;risk&#8221; of unforeseeable events through &#8220;integrated, holistic and balanced&#8221; techno-economic measures (PA, 6.8). In turn, the bottom-up process conveys an inverted normativity that reinforces &#8220;social cohesion&#8221; as the core of &#8220;sustainable and integral development&#8221; (Enc., 13). Thus, the Encyclical accounts for SD by means of decelerating the otherwise excessive &#8220;acceleration&#8221; of human affairs (Enc., 18, 61). The general macro-level norms humanity, divine love, and creation are intended to contribute to a higher sense of collective identity by limiting the pace and speed of individual conduct on the micro-level&#8212;an adverse but complementary process relative to the UN documents&#8217; account.</p>
