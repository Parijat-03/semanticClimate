It allows the developing world, already at the front line of climate change, to set the agenda. It will focus, most likely, on climate adaptation financing, establishing a monitoring framework for emission reduction targets. Water scarcity and quality were announced as leading themes of the conference. In terms of energy transition, the area of food systems, might be of special focus due to its strategic importance for the African continent.</p>
