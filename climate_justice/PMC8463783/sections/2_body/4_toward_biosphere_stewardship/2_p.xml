<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We argue that biosphere stewardship&#8212;the pursuit of social-ecological sustainability, from local to global scale, that ensures the health and resilience of Earth&#8217;s life support systems&#8212;is an indispensable guiding principle and building block for the successful implementation of these transformations (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In operational terms, biosphere stewardship implies a fundamental shift in governance from reducing human pressures only, to managing nature actively to promote multigenerational human wellbeing. This suggests that critical biomes should be recognized as global commons in service of humanity (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and managed in ways that connect local authority, nation state integrity and culture, with collective governance by the world community (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Indeed, the combination of local and indigenous knowledge with international technical and financial support is vital for enabling effective stewardship (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
