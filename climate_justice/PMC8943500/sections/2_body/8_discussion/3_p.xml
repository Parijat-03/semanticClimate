Research might somewhat fill in this gap, and therefore, it is satisfactory that this special issue contributes with theoretical perspectives on ECEfS. It must be noted that many teachers do great contributions to sustainability in their practices, without using the latest concepts. However, as is shown, teachers have problems understanding the new concepts and linking them to quality education. A holistic development is fundamental in ECEC pedagogy, as is working thematically and with projects. This tradition has great similarities with ECEfS. Pre-service education and professional development are ways for the profession to overcome the language divide. In contrast, one must ask what steps the political leaders and organisations take to bridge the gap. Thus, we argue that genuine dialogue around is essential to promote reciprocal respect and understanding as part of the transformation of our ways of living.</p>
