The newly established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIDB), and newly emerging developing-country finance institutions, are known to provide an additional adaptation finance (Neufeldt et&#160;al., 2018); however, despite these emerging financial sources, the region will fall short of the adaptation target in the Paris Agreement (Neufeldt et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="146.27" top="618.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="618.48" x1="146.27" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 618.48; y1: 628.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.4.3 Knowledge Gaps</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="594.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="594.6" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation cost estimates can vary between various studies due to the differences in methodologies they adopt. Some studies have conducted cost assessments using a combination of stakeholder consultations and quantitative modelling of climate-change impacts and adaptation (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014), while others depended solely on the quantitative modelling. Studies also differ in the coverage of sectors too: they either have focused on the multiple vulnerable sectors (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014) or on a single sector (Hossain et&#160;al., 2019). Studies have differed in their estimates depending on their ability to take into consideration the transition costs of sudden adaptation (Hossain et&#160;al., 2019), the nature of social cost and/or damage functions employed (Arto et&#160;al., 2019), the discount rates applied (Markandya and Gonz&#225;lez-Eguino, 2019) and consideration for the effects of GHG mitigation on adaptation needs (Duan et&#160;al., 2019a). In addition, the assumptions made on the pace of adaptation in estimating adaptation costs can make a difference in adaptation cost estimates. Adaptation at a slow or normal pace could require more adaptation finance, as large amounts of damage are not eliminated, than when adaptation is implemented at a faster rate (Markandya and Gonz&#225;lez-Eguino, 2019). Although there have been improvements in adaptation cost estimates, there is a need to address the issue of endogeneity (Kousky, 2014; Samuel et&#160;al., 2019). The vast majority of studies that rely on databases, such as EM-DAT, tend to suffer from such endogeneity problems due to their inability to control the causality between GDP and damages (Kousky, 2014). Costs attributable to non-economic losses and damages are the least reported and least quantified in the adaptation costs literature due to lack of sufficient, robust and accessible methodologies (Chiba et&#160;al., 2017; Chiba et&#160;al., 2019; Serdeczny, 2019). This is a major limitation in assessing adaptation costs and financial needs, and it can lead to gross underestimation of adaptation costs. A detailed description of issues related to non-economic losses and damages, and its importance in strengthening adaptation, is provided in Box&#160;10.6 and Table&#160;10.5.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="142.14" top="162.48"><span style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.72; y0: 162.48; y1: 172.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="42.52" y0="162.48" x1="142.14">10.5.5 Risk Insurance</span></div><div left="42.52" right="151.63" top="138.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="138.48" x1="151.63" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 138.48; y1: 148.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.5.1 Point of Departure</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.11" top="114.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="114.6" x1="296.11" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.45; y0: 114.6; y1: 124.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Risk insurance approaches and tools have significantly evolved during recent years. The emphasis has been mainly on mitigating the adverse selection and moral hazard that have been the limitations of traditional area-based crop insurance approaches (He et&#160;al., 2019). This has been achieved by shifting the indemnity calculations on to the specific weather parameters and developing a weather index (Greatrex et&#160;al., </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.13" top="714.61"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.61" x1="560.13" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 311.14; y0: 714.61; y1: 724.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">of insurance products have seen significant progress, including that of the blockchain and smart contracts (Gatteschi et&#160;al., 2018). There are technological developments in loss estimation, which has been a major limitation in the traditional insurance approaches in the past that either delayed the indemnity payment or misjudged the losses. Application of multi-model and multi-stage decision support systems has begun to make crop loss assessments for insurance more efficient (Aggarwal et&#160;al., 2020). Technological applications also include remote sensing (Di et&#160;al., 2017) and mobile phone app technologies (Meena et&#160;al., 2018) to provide accurate and quick damage assessments, and application of Internet-based indemnity approvals have enabled quick payment of indemnities (OECD, 2017b).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="377.55" top="558.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="558.48" x1="377.55" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 558.48; y1: 568.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.5.2 Findings</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.14" top="534.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="534.6" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.02; y0: 534.6; y1: 544.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As against financing post-disaster relief and reconstruction, which has been the norm of disaster management for decades in Asia, the evolution of ex-ante risk financing in the form of risk insurance has seen a steady rise globally and in Asia. The rise in popularity for risk financing in general and insurance in specific stem from the observation that governments have recognised the burden of mainly financing the post-disaster relief and reconstruction only (Juswanto and Nugroho, 2017; UNESCAP, 2018c; ADB, 2019), and from the realisation of cost savings and efficiency that risk financing for risk mitigation brings overall risk reduction (</span><span style="x0: 387.13; x1: 391.71; y0: 426.61; y1: 436.11; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="387.13" y0="426.61" x1="443.99">high agreement</span><span x0="443.99" y0="426.61" x1="448.2" style="x0: 443.99; x1: 446.27; y0: 426.61; y1: 436.11; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">, </span><span style="x0: 448.25; x1: 455.11; y0: 426.61; y1: 436.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="448.25" y0="426.61" x1="511.44">medium evidence</span><span x0="511.44" y0="426.61" x1="560.15" style="x0: 511.44; x1: 514.08; y0: 426.61; y1: 436.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).
