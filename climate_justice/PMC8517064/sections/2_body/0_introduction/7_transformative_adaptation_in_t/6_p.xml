(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>) distinguish between transformative and transformational adaptation with the former referring to process and the latter to the outcome. They define transformational adaptation in agriculture by three criteria: the response to climate risks, a redistribution of at least a third of the primary factors of production and consumption and within a timeframe of 25 tears. In the examples of transformational adaptation already occurring documented in the paper, the capacity for effective collective action at local levels is a key factor amongst most cases. Investing in knowledge and information services at local levels to support effective local level action, together with financing for investments that have long term and delayed returns are two of the recommendations from this analysis (Vermeulen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>). Financing plays an important role in their proposed actions to support transformative adaptation, particularly to compensate for changes that cause short term losses, particularly to small-scale farmers and food system participants (Vermeulen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>).</p>
