We define equity tools as decision-making frameworks that guide city governments to recognise and systematically incorporate justice and equity concerns throughout the policy process. Even though the scope of these instruments varies across cities, equity tools usually consist of a set of guiding questions or checklists that provide the basis for creating justice centred policies, identifying and engaging local community actors, developing implementation strategies, and/or analysing the justice and equity impacts of programs. Equity tools are one of the most novel strategies primarily geared toward the operationalisation of just climate policies. A recent example is the city of San Antonio&#8217;s &#8220;Climate Equity Screening Tool&#8221;, which includes over 30 guiding questions designed to identify the benefits and unintended consequences that policies may produce for local vulnerable groups. This tool will be used by key community actors to evaluate each strategy outlined in the climate action plan prior to implementation.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Overview of equity tools</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>City</th><th>Name of tool</th><th>Policy stage</th><th>Main guiding themes</th><th>Authors and sources</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anchorage, AK</td><td>Equity Implementation Guide</td><td>Implementation and evaluation</td><td>Equity analysis, identification of community members, community engagement, evaluation.</td><td>Will be developed by the plan&#8217;s Steering Committee and adapted from Portland&#8217;s equity framework.</td></tr><tr><td>Baltimore, MD</td><td>EquityLens</td><td>Design, implementation, and evaluation</td><td>Community engagement, data gathering, accessibility, capacity-building, priorities of vulnerable populations, disproportionate impacts, economic opportunity, displacement, accountability.</td><td>Adapted from the Government Alliance for Race and Equity&#8217;s &#8220;Equity Toolkit&#8221; and Portland&#8217;s &#8220;Climate Equity Considerations&#8221;.</td></tr><tr><td>Cleveland, OH</td><td>Racial Equity Tool</td><td>Design and implementation</td><td>Language, accountability and data, disproportional impacts, economic opportunity, neighbourhood engagement.</td><td>Developed by the plan&#8217;s Equity and Engagement Subcommittee and adapted from the Government Alliance for Race and Equity and Portland&#8217;s &#8220;Climate Equity Considerations&#8221;.</td></tr><tr><td>Oakland, CA</td><td><p>(a) Racial Equity Impact Assessment and Implementation Guide</p><p>(b) Racial Equity Implementation Guide</p></td><td>Design, implementation, and evaluation</td><td><p>(a) Equitable governance, community engagement, equitable investments, community resilience.</p><p>(b) Racial equity outcomes, community engagement, data gathering, equity gaps, accountability.</p></td><td><p>(a) Developed by the plan&#8217;s Equity Facilitator and adapted from the California Office of Planning and Research&#8217;s &#8220;Resiliency Guidebook Equity Checklist&#8221;, the NAACP&#8217;s &#8220;Our Communities, Our Power&#8221;; the Movement Strategy Center&#8217;s &#8220;Spectrum of Community Engagement to Ownership&#8221;; and material from the City of Oakland Department of Race and Equity</p><p>(b) Developed by the city of Oakland Department of Race and Equity.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Portland, OR</td><td>Equity Implementation Guide</td><td>Implementation</td><td>Data gathering, accessibility, capacity-building, effective partnerships, equitable distribution of costs and benefits, community wealth building.</td><td>Developed by the plan&#8217;s Equity Working Group.</td></tr><tr><td>San Antonio, TX</td><td>Climate Equity Screening Tool</td><td>Implementation and evaluation</td><td>Access and accessibility, affordability, cultural preservation, health, safety and security.</td><td>Not stated in the plan.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
