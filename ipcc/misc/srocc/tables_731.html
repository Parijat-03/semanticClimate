      <td>Women&#8217;s economic empowerment, decision-making power and voice is a necessity in SLM decisions (Mello and Schmink 2017a;\nTheriault et al. 2017b). Policies that address barriers include: gender considerations as qualifying criteria for funding programmes or\naccess to financing for initiatives; government transfers to women under the auspices of anti-poverty programmes; spending on health\nand education; and subsidised credit for women (medium confidence) (Jagger and Pender 2006; Van Koppen et al. 2013a; Theriault et\nal. 2017b; Agarwal 2018b). Training and extension for women to facilitate sustainable practices is also important (Mello and Schmink\n2017b; Theriault et al. 2017b). Such training could be built into existing programmes or structures, such as collective microenterprise\n(Mello and Schmink 2017b). Huyer et al. (2015) suggest that information provision (e.g., information about SLM) could be effectively\ndispersed through women&#8217;s community-based organisations, although not in such a way that it overwhelms these organisations or\nsupersedes their existing missions. SLM programmes could also benefit from intentionally engaging men in gender-equality training\nand efforts (Fletcher 2017), thus recognising the relationality of gender. Recognition of the household level, including men&#8217;s roles and\npower relations, can help avoid the decontextualised and individualistic portrayal of women as purely instrumental actors (Rao 2017b).</td>

      <td>Technology, policy, and programmes that exacerbate women&#8217;s workloads or reinforce gender stereotypes (MacGregor 2010; Huyer et\nal. 2015b), or which fail to recognise and value the contributions women already make (Doss et al. 2018b), may further marginalise\nwomen. Accordingly, some studies have described technological and labour interventions that can enhance sustainability while also\ndecreasing women&#8217;s workloads; for example, Vent et al. (2017) described the system of rice intensification as one such intervention.\nREDD+ initiatives need to be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve complementary synergies with\ngender dimensions.</td>

      <td>Secure land title and/or land access and control for women increases SLM by increasing women&#8217;s conservation efforts,\nincreasing their productive and environmentally beneficial agricultural investments, such as willingness to engage in tree planting\nand sustainable soil management (high confidence) as well as improving cash incomes (Higgins et al. 2018; Agarwal 2010; Namubiru-\nMwaura 2014b; Doss et al. 2015b; Van Koppen et al. 2013b; Theriault et al. 2017b; Jagger and Pender 2006). According FAO (2011b, p. 5),\nif women had the same access to productive resources as men, the number of hungry people in the world could be reduced by 12&#8211;17%.\nPolicies promoting secure land title include legal reforms at multiple levels, including national laws on land ownership, legal education,\nand legal aid for women on land ownership and access (Argawal 2018). Policies to increase women&#8217;s access to land could occur through\nthree main avenues of land acquisition: inheritance/family (Theriault et al. 2017b), state policy, and the market (Agarwal 2018). Rao\n(2017) recommends framing land rights as entitlements rather than as instrumental means to sustainability. This reframing may address\npersistent, pervasive gender inequalities (FAO 2015d).</td>
