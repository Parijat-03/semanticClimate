Ever more frequent extreme weather events, such as forest fires, droughts, and heavy rains cause abrupt disruption even in the global North, increasingly shattering what still appears to be a widespread perception of slowly advancing climate crisis (see Malm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>, p. 18). The geographic imbalance of affectedness is mitigated by increasingly tangible climate change impacts in countries of the global North. The fact that these take place as concrete events, such as heat waves, crop failures, and floods, makes the &#8216;hyperobject&#8217; of climate change take on concrete, albeit multiple, forms, thus generating political pressure for action with each successive incident.</p>
