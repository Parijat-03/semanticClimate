[<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that neighborhoods previously subject to redlining have 37% less tree canopy, leading to warmer temperatures). Another recent study by Hoffman, Shandas, and Pendleton of 108 U.S. urban areas found that 94% of neighborhoods that had been redlined had elevated temperatures compared to the rest of the city [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]).</p>
