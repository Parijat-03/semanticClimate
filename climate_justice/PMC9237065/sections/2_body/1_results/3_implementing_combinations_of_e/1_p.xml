Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates this for a single illustrative country, Germany, highlighting how systematically varying the weights among the three equity interpretations translates into different 2030 reduction targets. The color gradient in the figure conveys the required emissions reductions (resulting from a weighted combination of one capability, equality and responsibility interpretation) at any given point in the triangle&#8212;the location of such points indicates via its distance from the corners by the three axes the relative weighting of the chosen C, E, and R interpretations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Equity triangles illustrating the required emission reductions for Germany arising from combinations of equity interpretations, where the weights of the capability, responsibility, and equality interpretations sum to 1.</title><p>The isolines indicate emission reduction targets (by 2030, relative to 2005) and are labeled accordingly. For each point on an individual ternary chart, the color indicates the level of emissions reductions required, with yellow corresponding to lower levels, and blue higher. The level at each point is the result of a weighted combination of the three equity interpretations indicated on the chart axes. As an example, a point in the middle of <bold>A</bold> is the reduction amount given an equal combination of C1-EU-capability, E1-Basic-needs, and R1-Hist-emi. The red lines indicate the EU suggested reduction level in the Fit for 55 proposal&#8212;for Germany, &#8722;50%&#8212;if the value falls within the range of the chart. In <bold>B</bold> a different equality interpretation is applied (E3- Full-EPC).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31204_Fig3_HTML" id="d32e771"/></fig></p>
