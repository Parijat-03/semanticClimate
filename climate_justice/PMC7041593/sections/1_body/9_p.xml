While specialization and expertise are necessary, so too is an awareness of the integuments that hold us together&#8212;biologically, socially, ecologically, and terrestrially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The proverbial &#8216;parts&#8217; cannot contribute to the well-being of the &#8216;whole&#8217; if there is no clear articulation of this &#8216;whole&#8217;, let alone the links between the parts and the whole.
