Soil warming experiments show signi&#64257;cant variability in temperature and moisture responses across biomes and climates; Crowther et&#160;al. (2016) found that warming-induced SOC loss is greater in regions with high initial carbon stocks, while an analysis of an expanded version of the same dataset did not support this conclusion (Gestel et&#160;al. 2018). Studies of SOC responses to warming over time have also shown complex responses. In a multi-decadal warming experiment, Melillo et&#160;al. (2017) found that soil respiration response to warming went through multiple phases of increasing and decreasing strength, which were related to changes in microbial communities and available substrates over time. Conant et&#160;al. (2011) and Knorr et&#160;al. (2005) suggested that transient decomposition responses to warming could be explained by depletion of labile substrates, but that long-term SOC losses could be ampli&#64257;ed by high temperature sensitivity of slowly decomposing SOC components.

Microbial dynamics are believed to have an important role in driving complex responses to carbon additions. The addition of fresh organic material can accelerate microbial growth and SOM decomposition via priming effects (Kuzyakov et&#160;al. 2014; Cheng et&#160;al. 2017).

Historically, conceptual models of SOC cycling have centred on the role of chemical recalcitrance: the hypothesis that long-lived components of SOC are formed from organic compounds that are inherently resistant to decomposition. Under the emerging new paradigm, stable SOC is primarily formed by the bonding of microbially-processed organic material to mineral particles, which limits the accessibility of organic material to microbial decomposers (L&#252;tzow et&#160;al. 2006; Keiluweit et&#160;al. 2015; Kallenbach et&#160;al. 2016; Kleber et&#160;al. 2011; Hopkins et&#160;al. 2014). SOC in soil aggregates can be protected from microbial decomposition by being trapped in soil pores too small for microbes to access (Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2004; Six et&#160;al. 2004) or by oxygen limitation (Keiluweit et&#160;al. 2016). Some new models are integrating these mineral protection processes into SOC cycling projections (Wang et&#160;al. 2017a; Sulman et&#160;al. 2014; Riley&#160;et&#160;al. 2014; Wieder et&#160;al. 2015), although the sensitivity of mineral-associated organic matter to changes in temperature, moisture, &#64257;re (Box 2.1) and carbon inputs is highly uncertain. Improved quantitative understanding of soil ecosystem processes will be critically important for projection of future land&#8211;climate feedback interactions. </span></div></body></html>
