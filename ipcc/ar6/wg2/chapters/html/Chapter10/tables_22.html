      <td>The West Asia region, especially the Tigris&#8211;Euphrates alluvial plain, has been recognised as one of the most important dust-source areas\nin the world (Cao et al., 2015). The inhabitants of each of these settlements have experienced a decline in dust storms in recent decades,\nsince the late 1980s at Nouakchott, since 2004 at Zabol and since the late 1970s at Minqin. Iran is mostly arid or semiarid, with deserts\nmaking up at least 25 million hectares of the country (NASA, 2018). Iran is experiencing unprecedented climate-related problems such\nas drying of lakes and rivers, dust storms, record-breaking temperatures, droughts and floods (Vaghefi et al., 2019). There are three\nkey factors responsible for the generation of sand and dust storms: strong wind, lack of vegetation and absence of rainfall (EcoMENA,\n2020). It seems that all of this is closely related to the heating surface and the occurrence of local dry instabilities (Ghasem et al., 2012).\nAccording to EcoMENA (2020), sand and dust storms cause significant negative impacts on society, the economy and the environment\nat the local, regional and global levels. The seasonality of the numbers of dusty days (NDD) in Iran shows the highest frequency in\nsummer followed by spring and autumn (Modarres and Sadeghi, 2018). In the past decade, West Asia has witnessed more frequent and\nintensified dust storms affecting Iran and other Persian Gulf countries (Nabavi et al., 2016). In terms of long-term frequency of dust\nevents, observational analyses show an overall rising trend of the frequency of Iran&#8217;s dust events in recent years (Alizadeh-Choobari et al.,\n2016). Results show that there has been a direct relationship between dust event, drought and years of intensive drought (Dastorani\nand Jafari, 2019). Compared with the period 1980&#8211;2004, in the period 2025&#8211;2049, Iran is likely to experience more extended periods\nof extreme maximum temperatures in the southern part of the country, more extended periods of dry (for &#8805;120 d: precipitation &lt;2 mm,\nT &#8805;30&#176;C) as well as wet (for &#8804;3 d: total precipitation &#8805;110 mm) conditions and a higher frequency of floods (Vaghefi et al., 2019). The\nmax\nslope of precipitation in West Asia shows that during the period 2016&#8211;2045 in January, February, July and August, precipitation would\nincrease and decrease in other months of the year (Ahmadi et al., 2018). Temperatures in Central Asia have risen significantly within\nrecent decades, whereas mean precipitation remains almost unchanged (Haag et al., 2019); however, climatic trends can vary greatly\nbetween different sub-regions, across altitudinal levels and within seasons (Haag et al., 2019).</td>
