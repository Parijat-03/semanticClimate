The committee managed to establish the cruise ship as a&#160;symbol representing the negotiation of social conditions. At the same time, it functions as a&#160;link to actors elsewhere. The ship has a&#160;mediating role between the perspectives of different actors because it enables the creation of ever new meanings and allows for the establishment of transnational connections. In communicating their counter-narrative to the international public, the committee uses a&#160;number of different counter-symbols, ranging from their bodies to smaller and more traditional boats, manifesting the everyday rhythm and the use and knowledge of urban space. In their aim to keep the local rhythm noticeable, they render this position visible through their appropriation of symbolic spaces and places. Virtual spaces, too, have become integral in giving visibility to topics that people feel need to be shared and discussed. On Facebook, for example, the page &#8220;Venetians&#8221; depicts the city as seen by its actual inhabitants. In this way, both offline and online projects show the agency of the city&#8217;s residents and portray it in ways usually not included in the clich&#233;s offered by the tourism industry. When large ships were banned from passing San Marco in August 2021, the <italic>Comitato No Grandi Navi</italic> achieved its first major success. They pronounced that &#8220;there was no going back&#8221; (&#8220;indietro non si torna&#8221;), inviting others to join them &#8220;not only to support our struggle, but to say all together that it can&#8217;t go back to the way it was before, with the monoculture of tourism, the selling off of public property, cementing and land consumption.&#8221; (NoGrandiNavi 2021).</p>
