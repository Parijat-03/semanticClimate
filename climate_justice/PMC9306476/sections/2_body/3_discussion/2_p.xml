<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">At the core of an institutions' sustainability strategy needs to be an overarching goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the most recent climate science [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Emissions that are generated from all work or study&#8208;related activities need to be included in the reduction strategy, and the baseline and annual emissions should be reported internally and publicly. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is a globally recognised set of tools to measure and track emissions [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The GHG Protocol categorises emissions into three scopes: scope 1 emissions are generated directly from sources owned or controlled by the organisation; scope 2 emissions are caused indirectly from the generation of purchased energy; and scope 3 emissions are caused indirectly are a result of the organisation's operations and activities [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to the nature of research and higher education, most emissions generated in academic institutions are scope 2 from the consumption of electricity and gas to power offices, laboratories, data centres, teaching facilities and residencies and scope 3 from commuting, air travel, food, all purchasing and waste [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The GHG Protocol also offers online training on how to estimate emissions [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, carbon emissions calculations and methods are well described in a recent paper from a group of astronomy research institutions in the Netherlands and an online tool to calculate emissions from air travel is available from the Institute de Recherche Astrophysique et Planetologie (IRAP) [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
