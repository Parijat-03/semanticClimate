Here, she points out that none of the changes the book articulates will come about easily. She is absolutely right. It is all very well to argue that we must get rid of the corporation&#8212;and to formulate proposals to achieve this (e.g., to break up the corporate structure; to end impunity for shareholders; to end impunity for directors). But how do we get there? This is a struggle that will not be won by academic argument, but by confronting power on the streets, in communities and in workplaces. And there is little doubt that a meaningful attack on the corporation as an institution, including all of the privileges and protections granted to senior manager and shareholders, would require a social struggle on a scale and intensity that is, as yet, unprecedented.</p>
