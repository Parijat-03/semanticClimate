This information can be used to form 7 assessments about their quality, reliability or trustworthiness. In the context of the outcomes of the 8 Interactive Atlas, having an effective way of dealing with data provenance is a necessary condition to ensure 9 not only the reproducibility of results, but also to build trust on the information provided. However, the 10 relative complexity of the data and the post-processing workflows involved may prevent from a proper 11 communication of data provenance with full details for reproducibility. Therefore, a special effort has been 12 made in order to build a comprehensive provenance metadata model for the Interactive Atlas products.  13 14 Provenance frameworks are typically based on RDF (Resource Description Framework), a family of World 15 Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata model &#8211; RDF Working 16 Group 2014: www.w3.org/RDF (Candan et al., 2001). It is an abstract model that has become a general 17 method for conceptual description of information for the Web, using a variety of syntax notations and 18 serialization formats. Designed to provide a framework that ensures interoperability between metadata 19 frameworks, RDF allows for structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across 20 different applications. As a result, RDF has been widely adopted in many different fields. To this aim, 21 specific vocabularies have been written in RDF, containing a conceptual model of a particular &#8211; more or less 22 broad &#8211; domain of knowledge. Vocabularies list the types of objects, the relationships that connect them and 23 constraints on the ways that objects and relationships can be combined, being used for description, 24 classification and reasoning. METACLIP (Bedia et al., 2019) exploits RDF through specific vocabularies, 25 written in the OWL ontology language, describing different aspects involved in climate product generation, 26 from the data source to the post-processing workflow, extending international standard vocabularies such as 27 PROV-O (Moreau et al., 2015). The METACLIP vocabularies are publicly available in the METACLIP 28 GitHub repository (github.com/metaclip/vocabularies).  29 30 METACLIP makes an emphasis in the delivery of &#8216;final products&#8217; (understood as any piece of information 31 that is stored in a file, such as a plot or a map) with a full semantic description of its origin and meaning 32 attached to it. METACLIP ensures &#8216;machine readability&#8217; through the reuse of well-defined, standard 33 metadata vocabularies, providing semantic interoperability and the possibility of developing database 34 engines supporting advanced provenance analytics. Therefore, this framework has been adopted in order to 35 generate provenance information and attach it as metadata to the products generated by the interactive Atlas. 36 A specific vocabulary (IPCC_TERMS) is created alongside the inclusion of new products in the Interactive 37 Atlas and use the controlled vocabularies existing from CMIP and CORDEX experiments. As an example, 38 Figure Atlas.56: shows the semantic vocabularies needed to encode the information of the typical workflow 39 for computing (from bias-adjusted data) any of the climate indices (extreme or climate impact drivers) 40 included in the Interactive Atlas. 41 42 43 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.36; y0: 227.81; y1: 238.79; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="227.81" x1="215.87">[START Figure Atlas.56: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="227.81" x1="41.45" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 227.81; y1: 238.79; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">44 45 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 203.78; y1: 213.8; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="203.78" x1="128.36">Figure Atlas.56: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="203.78" x1="532.51" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 133.19; y0: 203.78; y1: 213.8; width: 5.57; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Schematic representation of the generation workflow, from database description, subsetting and data </span><span x0="27.66" y0="203.57" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 203.57; y1: 214.55; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">46 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="192.26" x1="528.73" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 130.4; y0: 192.26; y1: 202.28; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">transformation to final graphical product generation (maps and plots).
