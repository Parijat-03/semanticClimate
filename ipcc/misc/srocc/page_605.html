Consumers in lower-income countries are most affected by price volatility, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia at highest risk (Regmi and Meade 2013; Fujimori et&#160;al. 2019). However, understanding of the stability of food supply is one of the weakest links in global food system research (Wheeler and von Braun 2013) as instability is driven by a con&#64258;uence of factors (Headey and Fan 2008). Food price spikes in 2007 increased the number of people below the poverty line by between 100 million people (Ivanic and Martin 2008) and 450 million people (Brinkman et&#160;al. 2009), and caused welfare losses of 3% or more for poor households in many countries (Zezza et&#160;al. 2009).

Presumably, spending less on food frees up money for other activities, including adaptation, but it is unknown how much (Zezza et&#160;al. 2009; Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). In one example, reduction in staple food price costs to consumers in Bangladesh from food stability policies saved rural households 887 million USD2003 total (Torlesse et&#160;al. 2003). Food supply stability through improved supply chains also potentially reduces con&#64258;icts (by avoiding food price riots, which occurred in countries with over 100 million total in population in 2007/2008), and thus increases adaptation capacity (Raleigh et&#160;al. 2015).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="267.58"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 267.58; y1: 277.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="267.58" x1="571.76">There are no global estimates of the contribution of improved food transport and distribution, or of urban food systems, in contributing to adaptation, but since the urban population in 2018 was 4.2 billion people, this sets the upper limit on those who could bene&#64257;t.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="207.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 207.59; y1: 217.09; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="207.59" x1="571.76">Given that 65% (760 million) of working adults in poverty make a&#160;living through agriculture, increased energy ef&#64257;ciency in agriculture could bene&#64257;t these 760 million people.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="159.59"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 159.59; y1: 169.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.75]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="159.59" x1="571.76">Table 6.27 summarises the impacts on adaptation of supply management options, with con&#64257;dence estimates based on the thresholds outlined in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not&#160;exhaustive) references upon which the evidence in based.</span></div></body></html>
