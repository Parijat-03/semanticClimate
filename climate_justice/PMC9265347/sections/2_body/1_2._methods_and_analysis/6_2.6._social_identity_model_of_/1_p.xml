<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Previous work highlights the value of applying a programme theory a priori in the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While several concepts, such as the principles of ESD, guided the development, content and delivery of the PCS, in the absence of a previously established programme theory, we used the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA) [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to guide the selection of outcomes for this pilot study (<xref rid="ijerph-19-08039-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). While there are various other theoretical models in the field that could explain climate action, including the theory of planned behaviour, the norm activation theory and the comprehensive action determination model [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we chose the SIMPEA because, unlike the other models, it specifically intends to explain the complex interplay of collective factors that influence the appraisal of environmental crises and thus climate action, the main objective of the PCS. </p>
