In both temperature scenarios, Phoenix had the second highest regression coefficients for Latinx populations outside of California. Denver, Colorado, had the highest income regression values for both average and extreme heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f006">Figure 6</xref>) indicating a high thermal gradient between wealthier and poorer areas. Reno, Salt Lake City, and Albuquerque all also had high regression coefficients as well, indicating wealthier neighborhoods were substantially cooler than lower-income neighborhoods. All four of these cities configure with wealthier neighborhoods at higher elevations as the metro area encroaches on the foothills of their local mountain ranges.</p>
