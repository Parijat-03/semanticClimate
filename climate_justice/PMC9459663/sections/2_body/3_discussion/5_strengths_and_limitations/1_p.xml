We leveraged large, population-based health data sets from 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that span more than a decade, as well as a high-resolution weather data set. One limitation is that because of a lower amount of temporal data, this study analyzed prevalent HIV infection rather than incident HIV infection. It is therefore challenging to discern whether heavy rainfall is associated with an increase in HIV acquisition, onward HIV transmission, or an increase in HIV survival. We created the heavy rainfall exposure to include the 10 years preceding each outcome specific to country and year to maximize the chance that the exposure preceded the outcome as has been defined in a previous analysis of climate exposures and HIV<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>; however, it is possible that participants could have acquired HIV more than 10 years earlier. It is also possible that there could have been a lag in HIV diagnosis such that heavy rainfall in the most recent year associated with HIV transmission may not yet have been diagnosed until the following period. Longitudinal research on heavy rainfall and HIV incidence is required to further characterize the association identified in our study.</p>
