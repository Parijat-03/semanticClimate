<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0135">We find several examples in the literature on how tradeoffs and synergies between SDGs can be either mitigated or strengthened using participatory approaches. This includes co-production of knowledge, and several studies also show how processes of co-production have the potential to level the inequities and power asymmetries in adaptation (e.g., <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Sterling et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Orchard et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>). Our review also revealed how caring practices can serve to level epistemological and cultural hierarchies, empowering marginalized groups for transformative adaptation. (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Stirling, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arora, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Bond and Barth, 2020</xref>) A striking observation is that while these articles emphasize that a co-production approach is imperative for adaptation to be transformative and sustainable, for levelling power asymmetries and empowering marginalized groups, they do not address the &#8220;social&#8221; SDGs, such as SDG 5 Gender Equality or SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities. This is clearly a missed opportunity to discuss and highlight synergies between SDGs.</p>
