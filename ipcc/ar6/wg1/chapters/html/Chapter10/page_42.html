For temperature, all univariate methods are good for adjusting means, variance, and high quantiles (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019; Hertig et&#160;al., 2019). For precipitation, means, intensities, wet-day frequencies, and wet&#8211;dry and dry&#8211;wet transitions are well-adjusted (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019; Maraun et&#160;al., 2019b). The representation of high quantiles depends on the chosen method, although flexible quantile mapping performs best (Hertig et&#160;al., 2019). Empirical (non-parametric) methods perform better than parametric methods over the observed range, but it is unclear how this translates into extrapolation to unobserved values (IPCC, 2015; Hertig et&#160;al., 2019). Many quantile mapping methods overestimate interannual variability (Maraun et&#160;al., 2019b). Temporal and spatial dependence are usually not adjusted and thus inherited from the driving model (Maraun et&#160;al., 2019b; Widmann et&#160;al., 2019). Spatial fields are thus typically too smooth in space, even after bias adjustment (Widmann et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="498.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="498.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Several studies show improved simulations of present-day impacts, when the impact model is fed with bias-adjusted climate model output, including the assessment of river discharge (Rojas et&#160;al., 2011; Muerth et&#160;al., 2013; Montroull et&#160;al., 2018), forest fires (Migliavacca et&#160;al., 2013), crop production (Ruiz-Ramos et&#160;al., 2016), and regional ocean modelling (Macias et&#160;al., 2018).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="83.07" top="414.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="414.6" x1="83.07" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is </span><span style="x0: 85.53; x1: 90.1; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="85.53" y0="414.6" x1="147.26">high confidence </span><span x0="149.71" y0="414.6" x1="298.77" style="x0: 149.71; x1: 152.52; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that bias adjustment can improve the marginal distribution of simulated climate variables, if applied to a&#160;climate model that adequately represents the processes relevant for a&#160;given application (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.2).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="217.68" top="354.6"><span style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.3; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: EECUMV+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="50.74" y0="354.6" x1="217.68">10.3.3.7.3 Performance of weather generators</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.81" top="330.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="330.6" x1="298.81" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 58.3; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Weather generators represent well most aspects that are explicitly calibrated. This typically includes mean, variance, high quantiles (for precipitation, if explicitly modelled), and short-term temporal variability for both temperature and precipitation, whereas interannual variability is strongly underestimated (Frost et&#160;al., 2011; Hu et&#160;al., 2013a; Keller et&#160;al., 2015; Dubrovsky et&#160;al., 2019; Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019; Hertig et&#160;al., 2019; Maraun et&#160;al., 2019b; Widmann et&#160;al., 2019).

Case studies of regional trend simulations by global models can be found in Sections 10.4.1 and 10.6, and region-by-region assessments in the Atlas. A&#160;key limitation for assessing the representation of regional observed trends by single transient simulations of global models (or downscaled versions thereof) is the strong amplitude of internal variability compared to the forced signal at the regional scale (Section&#160;10.3.4.3). Even on multi-decadal time scales, an agreement between observed and individual simulated trends would be expected to occur only by chance (Laprise, 2014).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.34" top="558.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="558.6" x1="557.34" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 311.56; y0: 558.6; y1: 568.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the context of downscaling, the ability of downscaling methods to reproduce observed trends when driven with boundary conditions or predictors taken from reanalysis data (which reproduce the observed internal variability on long time scales) can be assessed. For temperature in the continental USA, reanalysis-driven RCMs skilfully simulated recent spring and winter trends, but did not reproduce summer and autumn trends, (Bukovsky, 2012). Over Central America, observed warming trends were reproduced (Cavazos et&#160;al., 2020). In contrast, a&#160;reanalysis-driven coupled atmosphere&#8211;ocean RCM covering the Mediterranean could not reproduce the observed SST trend (Sevault et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="426.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="426.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 426.6; y1: 436.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Similar studies have been carried out for statistical downscaling and bias adjustment using predictors from reanalyses (or in case of bias adjustment, dynamically downscaled reanalyses). For a&#160;range of different perfect prognosis methods, Huth et&#160;al. (2015) found that simulated temperature trends were too strong for winter and too weak for summer. The performance was similar for the different methods, indicating the importance of choosing informative predictors. Similarly, Maraun et&#160;al. (2019b) found that the performance of perfect prognosis methods depends mostly on the predictor and domain choice (for instance, temperature trends were only captured by those methods including surface temperature as predictor). Bias adjustment methods reproduced the trends of the driving reanalysis, apart from quantile mapping methods, which deteriorated these trends.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="258.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="258.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 314.19; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">RCM experiments are often set up such that changes in forcing agents are included only via the boundary conditions, but not explicitly included inside the domain. Jerez et&#160;al. (2018) demonstrated that not including time-varying GHG concentrations within the RCM domain may misrepresent temperature trends by 1&#8211;2&#176;C per century. Including the past trend in anthropogenic sulphate aerosols in reanalysis-driven RCM simulations substantially improved the representation of recent brightening and warming trends in Europe (Nabat et&#160;al., 2014; see Sections 10.3.3.6 and 10.6.4, and Atlas.8.4). Similarly, Bukovsky (2012) argued that RCMs may not capture observed summer temperature trends in the USA because changes in land cover are not taken into account. Barlage et&#160;al. (2015) have revealed that including the behaviour of groundwater in land schemes increases the performance of an RCM model to represent climate variability in the central USA. Hamdi et&#160;al. (2014) found that an RCM that did not incorporate the historical urbanization in the land-use, land-cover scheme is not able to reproduce the warming trend observed in urban stations, with a&#160;larger bias for the minimum temperature trend.</span></div></body></html>
