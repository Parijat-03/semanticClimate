The probability of moderate to severe food insecurity across the globe increased from 19.3% in 2014 to 30.7% in 2019 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Nearly 11% of the population across 83 countries suffered from severe food insecurity in 2019, a significant increase from 6.2% in 2014 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There are clear across and within-regional differences. For example, incidences of food insecurity are relatively higher in the Africa region, with Liberia, Guinea, and Mozambique reporting the highest levels of food insecurity. Honduras in the Americas, and Afghanistan and The Philippines in the Asia region, have also reported relatively high levels of food insecurity. While food insecurity is generally low in Europe, countries such as Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine have recently reported increasing levels of food insecurity. In terms of gendered impacts, 54% of the countries included in this analysis reported higher probability of food insecurity among women compared to men.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Probability of moderate to severe food insecurity (%) across regions.
