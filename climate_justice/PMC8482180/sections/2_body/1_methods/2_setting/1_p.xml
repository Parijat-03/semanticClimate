<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This project is being implemented first in a subarctic community with road access in northwest Saskatchewan, Canada, the Northern Village of &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse. Sakitawak, the Cree name for &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse, translates to <italic>the place where the river flows out</italic> [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Sakitawak represents the geographic location of the community on the lake of &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse, which made it a strategic location for the fur trade. Established in 1778, &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse is the second oldest community in Saskatchewan, with a population of approximately 1300 [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The median age of residents was 29 years in 2016, with approximately 65% of residents aged 15 to 64 years. &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse is a predominantly M&#233;tis community (77%), and Northern Michif is the traditional language [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The community celebrates the heritages of both European and First Nations. Commercial fishing, wild rice harvesting, forestry, a hospital, and a school are the primary sources of employment in the community. Mobile and Wi-Fi internet plans provide data access to community members, with most citizens aged &#8805;13 years owning smartphones. Moreover, the presence of a cell tower in &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse offers reliable access to cellular data. Wi-Fi and cellular data access vary widely within and between communities; hence, it is not always the case that remote communities have lower access.</p>
