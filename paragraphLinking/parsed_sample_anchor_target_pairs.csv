,"Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); net CO2from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2- LULUCF) (green); CH4; N2O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) (light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed GHGs CO2, CH4and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4and N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH4indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity.
