<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0040">We selected studies from the literature that show how processes of knowledge co-production can be conducted to increase the likelihood of adaptation actions, and those that link adaptation to the SDGs. The three objectives of the article, 1) how co-production approaches localize SDG targets and address tradeoffs and synergies, 2) whether they focus on power asymmetries and political dimensions in such participatory processes, and 3) whether and how the literature show that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift in the role of researchers, involve an evaluation of the outcome of processes of co-production for adaptation. This being a review article, the basis of this evaluation is the corpus of literature. The authors did not engage with participants in the co-production processes outlined in the corpus.</p>
