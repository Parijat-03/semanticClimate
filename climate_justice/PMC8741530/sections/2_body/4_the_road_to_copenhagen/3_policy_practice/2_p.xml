In Copenhagen, China&#8217;s Wen Jiabao (2009) and He Yafei (2009) insisted that its voluntary commitment under the UNFCCC was &#8216;unnegotiable&#8217; and the Copenhagen conference should &#8216;stick to rather than obscure the basic principles enshrined in the Convention and the Protocol&#8217;, and particularly, the CBDR principle &#8216;must never be compromised&#8217;. China resisted any initiatives that may directly or indirectly impose a cap for its emissions and restrict its future &#8216;emissions space&#8217; (Christoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>: 648). When developed countries requested China&#8217;s mitigation actions to meet international &#8216;measurable, reportable and verifiable&#8217; standards, China strongly rejected international scrutiny on its voluntary mitigation actions and stuck to protecting its sovereignty (He <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>). China insisted that developed countries should play the leadership role and pay for the costs for a cooperative solution (NDRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>). At last, China&#8217;s rigid and tough tactics in its climate diplomacy in Copenhagen received widely international criticism (Christoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). China&#8217;s developing country identity became hard to continue in GCG.</p>
