We noticed a clash between two distinct political ecologies to address climate change, namely, within Group I (environmentalists) and Group III (activists). On one hand, some highlighted how climate change was entwined with individual choices, including consumption patterns, eating habits and recycling:<disp-quote><p>We are still in a very consumerist society. Until we turn that around, we&#8217;ll keep talking about geoengineering. (GA &#8211; Group IV)</p><p>Change can only be individual. (MP &#8211; Group V)</p><p>We need to keep alerting people to reduce their ecological footprint. (PE &#8211; Group VI)</p><p>The solution is by changing how we eat, how we dress .&#8196;.&#8196;. (GL &#8211; Group III)</p></disp-quote></p>
