The prices of uptake of renewables continue to fall, and getting to net-zero is no longer a technological challenge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref> The clean energy transition poses political and sociological challenges. Although it has clear environmental, health, and economic benefits and is essential to keep global warming below 1.5&#160;&#176;C, it requires a shift from the status quo. In the short term, it will affect communities that depend on fossil fuels as a source of income. It will disproportionally affect those in the developing countries, where the financial resources for reskilling (and shifting to newer, less polluting technologies) are scarce. This is why redirecting public financing away from fossil fuels, and equitable sharing of the rewards from the transition is crucial. Although inevitable, this change is often unpopular and difficult politically, often dependent on political cycles and the prevailing poiltical sentiments at home. Nevertheless, the concerns of the affected communities, such as loss of only income, are valid. At the same time, we need to ask if this transition engages sufficiently women, youth, and indigenous communities and whether it mobilizes all the available talents.</p>
