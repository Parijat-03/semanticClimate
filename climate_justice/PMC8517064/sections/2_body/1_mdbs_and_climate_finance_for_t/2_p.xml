In 2019, the MDBs reported a total of US$ 14,937 million in commitments for climate change adaptation finance, with US$ 13,936 million, or 93 per cent, committed to low-income and middle-income economies. Approximately 7 percent of this total was committed to the crop and food production sector, while another 9 to 10 percent on other agricultural and ecological resources (Joint Report MDBs,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p>
