Here, we turn to the possibilities that exist in and through exhibition practices. Consider, for example, <italic>Klimax</italic> and <italic>Heureka Goes Crazy</italic> (one about climate change, the other about mental health, both at Heureka The Finnish Science Centre, Finland) and <italic>Sex: A Tell All</italic> (an exhibition about sex, sexuality, and sexual practices, located at the Montreal Science Centre, Canada). Such exhibitions provide hints as to how visitors can be encouraged to actively participate, debate, critique, and engage deeply with issues that are important to contemporary society and that cut across science and society (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As Butler and Lehrer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>) advocate, public institutions must experiment with &#8220;inclusive, critical, democratic, participatory, reflexive, multi-vocal, and socially relevant exhibition design&#8221; (p. 5).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p><italic>Race: Are We so Different?</italic> Science Museum of Minnesota, U.S.A.
