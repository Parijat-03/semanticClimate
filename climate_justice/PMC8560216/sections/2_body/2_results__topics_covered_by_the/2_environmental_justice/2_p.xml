Roberts-Gregory is an interdisciplinary social scientist who works at the intersection of ecowomanism and climate justice. She talked about the importance of decolonizing her research methods to truly capture the perspectives, mindsets, and experiences of Indigenous women and women of color who are protesting environmental injustices in their neighborhoods (e.g., Roberts-Gregory and Hawthorne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p>
