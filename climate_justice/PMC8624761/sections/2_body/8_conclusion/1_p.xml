Most importantly, responses to covid-19 are intrinsically political in the way debates are shaped, decisions are made, and priorities set.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our analysis shows that understanding issues and interventions as trade-offs is false. Instead, we must understand them as intersecting and thus create intersectional approaches to health challenges. To create better health interventions decisions must be guided by concerns about equity and human rights, but this requires sustained efforts, long term planning, and investment from governments. We must also apply lessons learnt to improve and rebuild health and wellbeing at the intersection of climate justice, international development, security, and gender equality.</p>
