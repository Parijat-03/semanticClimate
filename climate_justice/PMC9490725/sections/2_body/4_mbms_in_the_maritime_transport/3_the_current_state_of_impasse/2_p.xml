This is reflected in the fact that the IMO has not yet even been able to adopt the IPCC target of full decarbonisation by 2050, currently aiming for a minimum of 50% reduction by that date. The issue of climate justice with regard to the MBM discussion at the international level appears because some developing countries, particularly large nations China, Brazil and India, lobbied against many of these initiatives on the basis of the UNFCCC principle of &#8220;Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)&#8221;. According to this principle, the costs of decarbonising should apply first to the Annex 1 countries, which are industrialised countries and &#8220;countries in transition&#8221;. This principle conflicts with the IMO policy of &#8220;no more favourable treatment&#8221; (NMFT), a regulation that was introduced so that ships flying the flag of a country that had not ratified a convention do not benefit from evading such responsibilities. There exists no proposal or mechanism at the IMO to attempt to account for historical emissions in designing a framework for apportioning responsibility for decarbonising according to a timeline that takes into account the degree to which the Global North has disproportionately benefited from cheap transport of resources from the Global South (see, e.g. Givens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref> on &#8220;ecologically unequal exchange&#8221; and Hickel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref> on the concept of an atmospheric commons).</p>
