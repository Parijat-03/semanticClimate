<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0385">The emerging picture suggests that forests and forestry could make a significant contribution towards bioeconomy development, with potentially cross-cutting benefits for climate change and ecosystem services and even greater relevance as part of the recovery from the post-COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are evident constraints on forests' capacity to supply more biomass without compromising the delivery of the broader benefits of forests. Hence, a sophisticated policy response is required to support forest protection, restoration, and extension in conjunction with the mobilization of woody biomass resources.</p>
