Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a conceptual overview of such an approach. Each equity principle forms one corner of a triangle and is represented by an interpretation. The results of the chosen interpretations can be combined in a weighted sum to arrive at an allocation incorporating all three equity considerations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Conceptual overview of allocation approach.</title><p>Each distribution consists of three components, addressing each of the three IPCC equity considerations of (i) responsibility, (ii) capability, and (iii) equality. These equity considerations are interpreted via a set of interpretations, listed under each corner. The interpretations used in the main scenario are indicated as R1, E1, and C1; alternative interpretations are listed with subsequent numbers, e.g. R2, where the inherited benefits from pre-1995 emission-generating activities replaces historical emissions in the scenario calculations. As an example, Point A would indicate an allocation scenario where only responsibility is given weight. Point B represents an allocation where equal weight is given to all three equity considerations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_31204_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e680"/></fig></p>
