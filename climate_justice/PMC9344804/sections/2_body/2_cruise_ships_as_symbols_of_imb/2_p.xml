Alongside their ports of call, they have long become popular destinations in their own right, with advertisements suggesting designs inspired by places like the Piazza San Marco or Milan&#8217;s Cathedral Square (Ahoi 2019: 15).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> While cruise ports have experienced significant transformations, the tourism industry relies on the popular imagination in its efforts to attract customers (Saarinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2004</xref>). In reality, the alleged dream journey often stands in stark contrast with the working conditions for on-board staff, which are characterized by deregulation and precarity (Chin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>). A&#160;cruise journey is a&#160;global experience that takes place in a&#160;secured and regulated manner. Destinations can be experienced at a&#160;safe distance, without the need for physical proximity or interaction with local populations. At the same time, ships and passengers take up significant amounts of space. The industry is materialized in infrastructures and tourists and manifested through labor migration and the deterritorialized and stratified aspects of the shipping industry (Sekula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1995</xref>; Watts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014</xref>). Hence, industry, ship, and cruise travel create polarized and divided opinions.</p>
