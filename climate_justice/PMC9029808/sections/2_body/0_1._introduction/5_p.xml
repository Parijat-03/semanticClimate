<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This commentary reflects on the relationship between climate change, human rights, and public health from the perspective of youth engaged in climate action and discourse at the national and international levels. It argues that a human rights and public health lens to climate change action can more effectively ensure climate-resilient development and reduce the vulnerabilities of the most affected and impacted groups. Such an approach could not only help strengthen communities&#8217; resilience but also foster multisectoral mitigation and adaptation measures that address multiple pillars of the sustainable development goals. Specifically, we explore the role of youth-led intersectional interventions in ensuring equitable engagement in climate decision making and climate-just solutions, which simultaneously address the human rights, health, and well-being of the most affected and vulnerable groups aiming to enhance their resilience. In this commentary, we draw on the definition of intersectionality rooted in the work of Kimberl&#233; Crenshaw as a critical tool to identify the most marginalized communities within a particular spatial and cultural context, and offer insights on how these identities&#8217; rights can be upheld [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We then present a way forward on what we, as youth climate advocates and researchers, believe is a priority to foster intersectoral human rights and public health approaches to climate change. </p>
