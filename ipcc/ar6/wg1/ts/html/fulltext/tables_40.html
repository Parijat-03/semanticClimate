      <td>Future global warming exceeding the assessed very likely range cannot be ruled out and is potentially associated\nwith the highest risks for society and ecosystems. Such low-likelihood, high-warming storylines tend to exhibit\nsubstantially greater changes in the intensity of regional drying and wetting than the multi-model mean. Even at\nlevels of warming within the very likely range, global and regional low-likelihood outcomes might occur, such as large\nprecipitation changes, additional sea level rise associated with collapsing ice sheets (see Box TS.4), or abrupt ocean\ncirculation changes. While there is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)\nwill not experience an abrupt collapse before 2100, if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in\nregional weather patterns and water cycle. The probability of these low-likelihood outcomes increases with higher\nglobal warming levels. If the real-world climate sensitivity lies at the high end of the assessed range, then global\nand regional changes substantially outside the very likely range projections occur for a given emissions scenario.\nWith increasing global warming, some very rare extremes and some compound events (multivariate or concurrent\nextremes) with low likelihood in past and current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance\nthat events unprecedented in the observational record occur (high confidence). Finally, low-likelihood, high-impact\noutcomes may also arise from a series of very large volcanic eruptions that could substantially alter the 21st century\nclimate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model (ESM) projections. {Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8,\n7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8.6, 9.2, 9.6, Box 9.4, Box 11.2, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1}</td>

      <td>Previous IPCC reports largely focused their assessment on the projected very likely range of future surface warming and associated\nclimate change. However, a comprehensive risk assessment also requires considering the potentially larger changes in the physical\nclimate system that are unlikely or very unlikely but possible and potentially associated with the highest risks for society and\necosystems (Figure TS.6). Since AR5, the development of physical climate storylines of high warming has emerged as a useful approach\nfor exploring the future risk space that lies outside of the IPCC very likely range projections. {4.8}</td>

      <td>Uncertainty in the true values of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) dominate uncertainty\nin projections of future warming under moderate to strong emissions scenarios (Section TS.3.2). A real-world ECS higher than the\nassessed very likely range (2&#176;C&#8211;5&#176;C) would require a strong historical aerosol cooling and/or a trend towards stronger warming from\npositive feedbacks linked to changes in SST patterns (pattern effects), combined with a strong positive cloud feedback and substantial\nbiases in paleoclimate reconstructions &#8211; each of which is assessed as either unlikely or very unlikely, but not ruled out. Since CMIP6\ncontains several ESMs that exceed the upper bound of the assessed very likely range in future surface warming, these models can\nbe used to develop low-likelihood, high warming storylines to explore risks and vulnerabilities, even in the absence of a quantitative\nassessment of likelihood. {4.3.4, 4.8, 7.3.2, 7.4.4, 7.5.2, 7.5.5, 7.5.7}</td>

      <td>CMIP6 models with surface warming outside, or close to, the upper bound of the very likely range exhibit patterns of large widespread\ntemperature and precipitation changes that differ substantially from the multi-model mean in all scenarios. For SSP5-8.5, the\nhigh-warming models exhibit widespread warming of more than 6&#176;C over most extratropical land regions and parts of the Amazon.\nIn the Arctic, annual mean temperatures increase by more than 10&#176;C relative to present-day, corresponding to about 30% more than\nthe best estimate of warming. Even for SSP1-2.6, high-warming models show on average 2&#176;C&#8211;3&#176;C warming relative to present-day\nconditions over much of Eurasia and North America (about 40% more than the best estimate of warming) and more than 4&#176;C warming\nrelative to the present over the Arctic in 2081&#8211;2100 (Box TS.3, Figure 1). Such a high global warming storyline would imply that the\nremaining carbon budget consistent with a 2&#176;C warming is smaller than the assessed very likely range. Put another way, even if\na carbon budget that likely limits warming to 2&#176;C is met, a low-likelihood, high-warming storyline would result in warming of 2.5&#176;C\nor more. {4.8}</td>

      <td>CMIP6 models with global warming close to the upper bound of the assessed very likely warming range tend to exhibit greater\nchanges in the intensity of regional drying and wetting than the multi-model mean. Furthermore, these model projections show\na larger area of drying and tend to show a larger fraction of strong precipitation increases than the multi-model mean. However,\nregional precipitation changes arise from both thermodynamic and dynamic processes so that the most pronounced global warming\nlevels are not necessarily associated with the strongest precipitation response. Abrupt human-caused changes to the water cycle\ncannot be ruled out. Positive land surface feedbacks, involving vegetation and dust, can contribute to abrupt changes in aridity,\nbut there is only low confidence that such changes will occur during the 21st century. Continued Amazon deforestation, combined\nwith a warming climate, raises the probability that this ecosystem will cross a tipping point into a dry state during the 21st century\n(low confidence).
