As more and more people around the world have access to the Internet, online and social media are becoming significant contexts that include news, debate, action, and social contributions related to climate change. The campaigns are initiated by governments and international organizations, scientists and scientific institutions, organizations, groups and people in the civil society, public intellectuals and political, religious leaders, people of culture and entertainment.</p>
