We could, for example, also make the argument that having the capability of engaging in some aesthetic activities, or enjoying beauty, is required in order to avoid dehumanization. But in contrast to the capability of procreating, there are many ways to give shape to the capability of expressing something aesthetically. Given the current ecological circumstances, this could then give us an argument for a set of ecologically-nonintrusive capabilities for aesthetic expression as entitlements of social justice. Matters are different in the case of procreative parenting, since that is a specific capability that is incommensurable with other capabilities that have a much smaller eco-footprint. In the case of procreation, there is no alternative way to realize this capability&#8212;the only way is to have a child, and not, for example, to have a plant that one can water and talk to. But it could be said that the capability is realized by having a single child, or possibly two children, depending on how much value we believe there is in the experience of having siblings. Finally, there are plenty of activities that are not required for us to understand ourselves as human beings, that is, capabilities that would lead to dehumanizing if they were not guaranteed for all. Again, which activities would fall into that category is a question that needs further argumentation, but arguably most, or perhaps even all, forms of overconsumption would be in this category.</p>
