The fact that less than 2 percent of the respondents used the &#8216;Don&#8217;t know, no opinion&#8217; option indicates that the question was meaningful to most respondents. Furthermore, we see that only 2 percent of the interviewees indicated that government should prioritize adaptation over mitigation. Support for a focus on mitigation was clearly much larger, with 45 percent. However, the largest group consisted of those individuals who believe that government should not prioritize either mitigation or adaptation in the distribution of limited resources (51%). While further research would be needed to flesh out climate activists&#8217; attitudes on specific mitigation and adaptation policies, this finding challenges the common assumption that climate activism is primarily about mitigation. More than half of the respondents do not seem to share authors&#8217; common preoccupation with mitigation.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of preferences for prioritization of mitigation and adaptation, given limited resources</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"><italic>N</italic></th><th align="left">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Prioritize mitigation</td><td align="left">990</td><td align="left">45.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Prioritize adaptation</td><td align="left">50</td><td align="left">2.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Give equal priority</td><td align="left">1112</td><td align="left">50.82</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Don&#8217;t know/no opinion</td><td align="left">36</td><td align="left">1.65</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
