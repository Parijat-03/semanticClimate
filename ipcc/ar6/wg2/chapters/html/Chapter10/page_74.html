In the Arab region of Asia (ARA), the following are critical: capacity building to develop knowledge and awareness; mainstreaming CCA and DRR in the national strategies and policies (e.g., water and environmental strategies); empowering the role of CCA and DRR actors, notably women and rural societies; adopting lessons learned from regions with physical characteristics similar to those of ARA; establishing forecasting and prediction platforms that are supported by advanced monitoring technologies (e.g., remote sensing); and encouraging universities and research centres to develop studies on CCA and DRR. In Southeast Asia, laws and policies, institutional and financial arrangements, risk assessment, capacity building, and planning and implementation are entry points in integrating CCA and DRR (Lassa and Sembiring, 2017; Agency, 2018). According to Cutter et&#160;al. (2015), holistic solutions and integrated approaches, rigorous risk research that shows coherent science-based assessment and knowledge transfer from research to practice, and aligned targets on disaster risk management, climate change and sustainable development targets, are critical. Social capital and SP measures could promote pro-poor and gender-responsive adaptation as well as socially inclusive policies (Dilshad et&#160;al., 2019; Yari et&#160;al., 2019). Community-based approaches could allow local perceptions of climate change and experience of place to be included in planning (Dujardin et&#160;al., 2018; Dwirahmadi et&#160;al., 2019; Widiati and Irianto, 2019), and multi-stakeholder participation could engage various actors such as the private sector in CCA and DRR. Furthermore, multi-level climate governance could benefit from vertical and horizontal interactions at different levels and layers in the city (Zen et&#160;al., 2019). To mainstream and secure funding commitments, CCA and DRR could be integrated into national development plans and sectoral long-term plans (Ishiwatari and Surjan, 2020; Rahayu et&#160;al., 2020; Rani et&#160;al., 2020b).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="146.27" top="282.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="282.48" x1="146.27" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 282.48; y1: 292.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.2.3 Knowledge Gaps</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="258.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="258.6" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.97; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adaptation follows knowledge on risks, and literature exists that systematically identifies and characterises exposure and vulnerability, but gaps still exist. Decision making under uncertainty is challenged by the lack of data for adapting to current and uncertain future climate, the different perceptions of risk, and the potential solutions across different cultures and languages (van der Keur et&#160;al., 2016). Lack of downscaled climatic data, diverse institutional structures, and missing links in policies, are among the challenges in South Asia (Mall et&#160;al., 2019). In agriculture, there are gaps in the use of advanced farming techniques such as drought-resistant crops, and information on climate change to support farming households in making adaptation decisions (Akhtar et&#160;al., 2019; Khanal et&#160;al., 2019; Ullah et&#160;al., 2019). Better understanding of effective water management is crucial due to conflicts for shared water in ARA (Shaban and Hamze, 2017; UNDP, 2018). For delta regions, gaps identified are methodologies and approaches appropriate for understanding social vulnerability at various scales, pathways required for adaptation policy and response in the deltas that transcend development, and the lessons from implemented policy and </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.12" top="714.63"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.63" x1="560.12" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 309.2; y0: 714.63; y1: 724.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">(Lwasa, 2015).

All these resources are highly vulnerable to climate change (Sections&#160;10.3.1, 10.3.4). Poor people are most affected due to changes in resources availability and accessibility. Food, water and energy security are interconnected (Bizikova et&#160;al., 2013; Ringler et&#160;al., 2013; Rasul, 2014; Chang et&#160;al., 2016; Ringler et&#160;al., 2016). Although adapting to climate change is one of the core components of the global, regional, national and subnational agendas, the focus of adaptation action has remained sectoral. Undermining the interlinkages of food, energy and water security may increase trade-offs between sectors or places, which may lead to maladaptation (Barnett and O&#8217;Neill, 2010; Howells et&#160;al., 2013; Lele et&#160;al., 2013). Therefore, focusing on the nature of trade-offs and synergies across the food&#8211;water&#8211;energy nexus for integrated management of resources is a potential strategy for adaptation to both climatic and non-climatic challenges (Bhaduri et&#160;al., 2015; Zaman et&#160;al., 2017). Due to its importance to the Paris Agreement and SDGs, the food&#8211;water&#8211;energy nexus approach has gotten increasing attention in terms of capturing synergies and minimising trade-offs in this interconnected system, which is also critical for enhancing adaptation together (Bazilian et&#160;al., 2011; Lawford et&#160;al., 2013; UNESCAP, 2013; FAO, 2014; Rasul and Sharma, 2014; Taniguchi et&#160;al., 2017a; Sukhwani et&#160;al., 2019; Sukhwani et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="377.55" top="306.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="306.48" x1="377.55" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 306.48; y1: 316.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.3.2 Findings</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.14" top="282.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="282.6" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The food&#8211;water&#8211;energy nexus can be evaluated in the two-way interactions between water&#8211;food, water&#8211;energy and food&#8211;energy (Taniguchi et&#160;al., 2017a). The water&#8211;energy nexus includes water for energy and energy for water (Rothausen and Conway, 2011; Hussey and Pittock, 2012; Byers et&#160;al., 2014), the water&#8211;food nexus includes water for food and the impact of food production on water (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012) and the energy&#8211;food nexus includes energy consumption for food production and food crops for biofuel production (Tilman et&#160;al., 2009). The food&#8211;water&#8211;energy&#8211;land nexus has diverse implications at the sub-regional level in Asia. The increase in the water-supply gap raises questions about the sustainability of the main mode of electricity generation in South Asia. Thermal power generation and hydropower generation are both threatened by water shortages in South Asia (Luo, 2018b; Mitra et&#160;al., 2021). Furthermore, policy-mismatch-driven anthropogenic causes lead to unsustainable water use for food production in India. For example, subsidised electricity supply for watering agriculture plays a key role in losing groundwater&#8217;s buffer capacity against the various changes including climate variabilities (Badiani et&#160;al., 2012; Mitra, 2017).
