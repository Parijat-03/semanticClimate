The total energy consumed by commercial sector in the year 1990 was 3,934,800 (GJ) which increased to 17,067,600 (GJ) in the year 2010 at a CAGR of 7.61 % between the same period. The high growth rate of the energy demand in commercial sector can be attributed to a number of factors like increase in population, per capita income &amp; changing lifestyles of people.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.06" top="605.43"><span x0="72.02" y0="605.43" x1="508.06" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 605.43; y1: 617.43; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Similarly, the share of industrial sector in consumption of total energy in the year 1990, 2006 &amp; 2010 was 5%, 6% &amp; 7% respectively. The total energy consumed by industrial sector in the year 1990 was 3,559,066 (GJ) which increased to 10,959,396 (GJ) in the year 2010 at a CAGR of 5.78 % between the same period.    </span></div><div left="72.02" right="508.12" top="529.92"><span x0="72.02" y0="529.92" x1="508.12" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 529.92; y1: 541.92; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Knowing the current patterns of energy use and assumptions about future trends in economic activity, we constructed an activity driven model to forecast what would be the natural long term evolution of energy use in NCT-Delhi for each end use sector by 2025. Through analysis of current patterns of energy use, drivers of energy use were identified at the sectoral level. We then connected trends in activity drivers with projections of GDP to determine what would be the impact of economic growth on drivers of energy use. We have also considered fuel or technology switching in the forecast for some sectors. Accordingly we have constructed three different scenarios of future energy need for NCT-Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="212.69" top="390.7"><span x0="72.02" y0="390.7" x1="212.69" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 390.7; y1: 402.7; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Business-as-usual Scenario </span><span x0="72.02" y0="375.1" x1="508.14" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 375.1; y1: 387.1; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario assumes the economy to grow at 8.0% per annum for a period of next fifteen years from 2010 to 2025. The first observation is that the current picture of energy consumption breakdown is not expected to dramatically change as demand for all end users will grow simultaneously. The same activities that require energy today will continue to consume energy in 2025. The total energy consumed by all the four sectors in the year 2010 is 156,513,427 (GJ), which is expected to reach 445,245,459 (GJ) in the year 2025 at a CAGR of 7.22 % under the BAU scenario. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.98" top="251.95"><span x0="72.02" y0="251.95" x1="507.98" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 251.95; y1: 263.95; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Under the BAU scenario the share of transport sector in the total energy consumption in the year 2015, 2020 &amp; 2025 is expected be 46.94%, 46.45% &amp; 45.91% respectively as compared to 47% in the year 2010. The total energy consumed by transport sector in the year 2010 is 74,126,305 (GJ), which is expected to reach 204,427,513 (GJ) in the year 2025. The energy demand in the transport sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.00% between the year 2010 and 2025. The increase in transport energy demand will result from the increase in number of vehicles on the roads of Delhi. In the transport sector the share of diesel &amp; petrol is expected to decrease from current share, whereas that of CNG will drastically increase. The primary reason driving the reduction of petrol &amp; diesel consumption would be rise in prices of fossil fuels; nonetheless various other factors like availability of alternative technology, concern for environment &amp; policy initiatives will also play a minor role. According to our assumptions the share of CNG in total energy </span></div></body></html>
