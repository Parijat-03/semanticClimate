After their return from Casamance, Arame inhabitants preferred to invest in the less labor-intensive inland swamp rice cultivation and cashew tree planting. Cashews have the advantage of providing both an alcoholic beverage and the money to buy imported rice (which can also be obtained through direct exchange with the nuts), and Arame villagers do not want to give back the Djobel upland that they have progressively occupied with the cash crop. In 2019, the government finally attributed to Djobel a piece of their upland, on which they could build houses. Nevertheless, during their attempts to slash-and-burn the area, several people were injured and some killed by Arame inhabitants, supported by Casamance rebels (one was caught and imprisoned). Djobel's lack of voice in getting its rights recognized by the state is due, according to its inhabitants and many interviewees from other villages, to the strong representation that Arame has both in the army and in the main political party, which has governed the country for most of the time since Independence.</p>
