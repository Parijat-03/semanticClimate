There is robust evidence that dry soil moisture anomalies\nfavour summer heatwaves. Part of the projected increase in heatwaves and droughts can be attributed to soil moisture feedbacks\nin regions where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture availability (medium confidence). Vegetation changes can also amplify\nor dampen extreme events through changes in albedo and evapotranspiration, which will influence future trends in extreme events\n(medium confidence).</td>
