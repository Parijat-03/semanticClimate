The only way this thesis can break down is by showing that there is something special about procreation compared to other ways in which ecological resources are used beyond what is needed to meet our basic needs, that is, overconsumption. Young reviews several potential arguments that one could use to undermine the Moral Equivalence Thesis, yet he claims that none of them is convincing. While the Moral Equivalence Thesis has been defended explicitly by Young and MacIver, it is also implicitly assumed in the arguments of other philosophers, such as Peter Vallentyne, who argues for individual ecological resource entitlements (or emission quotas) whereby procreators should take the resources that their offspring need from their own entitlements, and Paula Casal and Andrew Williams, who argue that nonparents should not pick up the bill of the negative externalities that procreation causes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> More recently, Simon Caney has defended a view he calls ecological liberalism, which also treats procreative choices as they relate to matters of environmental distributive justice as on a par with other choices, including choices concerning overconsumption.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref></p>
