      <td>to help decision-makers in navigating through this uncertainty. Futures analysis comprises a number of different and widely\nused methods, such as scenario analysis (Rounsevell and Metzger 2010), envisioning or target setting (Kok et al. 2018),\npathways analysis (IPBES 2016; IPCC 2018),1 and conditional probabilistic futures (Vuuren et al. 2018; Engstrom et al. 2016;\nHenry et al. 2018) (Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). Scenarios and other methods to characterise the future can support a discourse\nwith decision-makers about the sustainable development options that are available to them. All chapters of this assessment draw\nconclusions from futures analysis and so, the purpose of this box is to outline the principal methods used, their application domains,\ntheir uncertainties and their limitations.\nExploratory scenario analysis\nMany exploratory scenarios are reported in climate and land system studies on climate change (Dokken 2014), such as related to\nland-based, climate change mitigation via reforestation/afforestation, avoided deforestation or bioenergy (Kraxner et al. 2013;\nHumpenoder et al. 2014; Krause et al. 2017) and climate change impacts and adaptation (Warszawski et al. 2014). There are global-scale\nscenarios of food security (Foley et al. 2011; Pradhan et al. 2013, 2014), but fewer scenarios of desertification, land degradation and\nrestoration (Wolff et al. 2018). Exploratory scenarios combine qualitative &#8216;storylines&#8217; or descriptive narratives of the underlying causes\n(or drivers) of change (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000; Rounsevell and Metzger 2010; O&#8217;Neill et al. 2014) with quantitative projections\nfrom computer models. Different types of models are used for this purpose based on very different modelling paradigms, baseline\ndata and underlying assumptions (Alexander et al. 2016a; Prestele et al. 2016). Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box below outlines how\na combination of models can quantify these components as well as the interactions between them.\nExploratory scenarios often show that socio-economic drivers have a larger effect on land-use change than climate drivers\n(Harrison et al. 2014, 2016). Of these, technological development is critical in affecting the production potential (yields) of food\nand bioenergy and the feed conversion efficiency of livestock (Rounsevell et al. 2006; Wise et al. 2014; Kreidenweis et al. 2018),\nas well as the area of land needed for food production (Foley et al. 2011; Weindl et al. 2017; Kreidenweis et al. 2018). Trends in\nconsumption, for example, diets or waste reduction, are also fundamental in affecting land-use change (Pradhan et al. 2013; Alexander\net al. 2016b; Weindl et al. 2017; Alexander et al. 2017; Vuuren et al. 2018; Baj&#382;elj et al. 2014). Scenarios of land-based mitigation\nthrough large-scale bioenergy production and afforestation often lead to negative trade-offs with food security (food prices), water\nresources and biodiversity (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).\nMany exploratory scenarios are based on common frameworks such as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Popp et al. 2016;\nRiahi et al. 2017; Doelman et al. 2018)) (Section 1.2). However, other methods are used. Stylised scenarios prescribe assumptions\nabout climate and land-use change solutions, for example, dietary change, food waste reduction and afforestation areas</td>
