These are also the people who face the greatest risks of criminalization, and state and non-state violence because of their struggles for land, water, resource and workers&#8217; rights. Participation in CFS policy processes has served as a catalyst for documenting and making visible to MSs food sovereignty practices in different territories and contexts, and translating the needs and demands of CSM constituencies into policy proposals.</p>
