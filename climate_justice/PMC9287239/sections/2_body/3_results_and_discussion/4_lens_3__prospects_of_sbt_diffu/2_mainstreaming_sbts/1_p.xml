Six years later, that perspective is challenged by the number of companies setting SBTs, the rate of new adopters, and the combined emissions involved ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). While it is unknown whether the number of companies with SBTs will continue to grow, some scholars argue for the existence of positive feedback mechanism in the uptake of voluntary climate initiatives. The SBTi refers to diffusion of innovations theory (referencing Rogers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]), according to which &#8220;adoption of an innovation by 10&#8211;25% of a system&#8217;s members (i.e., the &#8216;critical mass&#8217;) is followed by rapid adoption by the remaining members&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Likewise, Banda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] argue that actors that have already joined private climate governance schemes can influence other actors to join through both market and normative power. However, Banda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] also argue that a list of criteria must be fulfilled for a climate governance scheme to be effective, relating to integrity, uptake, ambition, resilience, transparency, and materiality. Government incentives may also increase the uptake of SBTs. In Japan, the ministry of the environment offers companies free advice from consultants on the setting of SBTs, which has facilitated high uptake in that country (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), as recounted by Dagnet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
