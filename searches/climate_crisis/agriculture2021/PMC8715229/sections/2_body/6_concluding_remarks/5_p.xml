<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0610">The United Nations Food System Summit (UNFSS) has brought further attention to the importance of food and land-use systems for sustainable development. Assessments in the lead-up to UN Climate Conference in Glasgow (COP26) show that the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) fall short in their collective ambition of aligning with emissions reductions required for a pathway toward limiting global warming to 1.5&#8239;&#176;C or at least well below 2&#8239;&#176;C above pre-industrial levels (e.g. <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2021</xref>). With the NDCs capturing national level targets and measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation, a recent assessment emphasized the importance of more comprehensively targeting food and land-use as an opportunity for scaling up action (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2021</xref>). The declarations of over 130 countries to stop forest loss and degradation by 2030<xref rid="fn0085" ref-type="fn">17</xref>
and country coalitions forming for strengthening environmental stewardship and protecting networks of marine and coastal areas announced during COP26, should be seen as impetus for further ratcheting up ambitions at the CBD and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in particular for the protection of terrestrial and marine resources and promoting integrated solutions to tackling food and nutritional security, climate and environmental change.</p>
