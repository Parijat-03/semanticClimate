The precautionary principle requires cost-effective measures to address serious but uncertain risks (Farber 2015). It supports a rights-based policy instrument choice as consideration is whether actions or inactions harm others moving beyond traditional risk-management policy considerations that surround net bene&#64257;ts (Etkin et al. 2012).
