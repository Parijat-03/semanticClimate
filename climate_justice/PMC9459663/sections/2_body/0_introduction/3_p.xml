Modeling studies project a large increase in flood frequency in some global regions, including eastern Africa, and floods have been associated with food insecurity, human migration, and disruption of infrastructure, all of which are associated with greater HIV risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220857r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
