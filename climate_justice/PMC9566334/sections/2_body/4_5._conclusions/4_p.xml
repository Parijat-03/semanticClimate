This research underscores potential interactions within the social&#8211;physical environment that create extremely hazardous thermal conditions. As global temperatures continue to rise, and as evidenced by the warming quantified in this study, some locations in cities will become &#8220;unlivable&#8221; during the summer months in the near future [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In fact, it may be too late to alter this outcome and the necessity to prepare to mitigate effects of warming is becoming increasingly evident. The primary way for research (such as this) to have the most impact is through affecting policy and therefore it must be brought before policymakers where objective action can be taken, especially for our most vulnerable communities. In this way, research not only elucidates the degrees of injustice and the expectations for the future, but can be used to guide necessary intervention strategies that will make environmental and social inequities less pronounced. To have the most effect, these actions will not only require increased funding, resource allocation in affected communities, and involvement from the scientific community, but will necessitate local participation of the populations that are most inequitably exposed and at the highest risk.</p>
