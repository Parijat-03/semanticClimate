To prevent future outbreaks, they need to maintain a strict border-control policy (Baker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>), which costs their economy immensely. As the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, remarked at the press conference on COVID-19 response, the reality of the pandemic is that &#8220;no one is safe until everyone is safe&#8221;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> The same is true for climate change. The groundswell of climate change and its policy response will swallow up everyone. In other words, this inescapability of global interconnectedness is our new ontology of being humans in the Anthropocene (L&#246;vbrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>).</p>
