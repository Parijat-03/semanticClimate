<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One article by Benjamin (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) supported this theme and offered a recent opinion and analysis. As current president of the American Public Health Association, Benjamin noted that the recent COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has not only stressed public health systems in countries globally, but also has further uncovered gaps in health care for those deeply affected by poorer social determinants of health. It is important to note that both COVID&#8208;19 and climate change disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations with climate change affecting those who least contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Benjamin noted: &#8220;tragically, underserved and vulnerable populations are being disproportionately affected, just as they are by most health threats&#8221; (p. 3). Healthy People 2020 (Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention [CDC],&#160;<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) adopted the view of the social determinants of health in five domains that include economic stability, education, health and health care, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context. The social determinants of health have broadly included race/ethnicity; however the concepts of racism and structural/systemic racism were identified and linked due to the overwhelming deleterious impacts on health in COVID&#8208;19 and health impacts of climate change as noted in Benjamin's (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) commentary.</p>
