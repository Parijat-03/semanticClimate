<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para10">Human societies have evolved dramatically over the past few hundred years such that we might expect change to be something we are all well equipped to handle, and even embrace. To some extent that is true, but clearly much depends on how things change, how well those changes fit with our personal, social, and national narratives, and how quickly these changes occur. Perspectives on change are also influenced by how it affects the material wellbeing of individuals. Predictability is a further important factor. In general, predictable changes, even difficult ones, can be navigated if they can be foreseen with enough time and if actors have sufficient agency to take appropriate action. We exist as individuals within complex social, political, and economic contexts in which we may have limited personal understanding, influence, and agency. Climate change and biodiversity decline demand that we take significant steps to change our trajectory to avoid broadly predictable crises ahead, but even though the fundamental science is clear, there is still much room for debate about how best to navigate the road ahead. In addition to a multiplicity of normative and philosophical frames there are structural barriers to change and issues of power, influence, and geopolitics which make meaningful action slow and feel personally remote. For many this situation fuels a sense of eco-anxiety, which is perhaps particularly prevalent among the young who will live with greater change but have little direct influence. In this issue we present four Comments that tackle different dimensions of the psychological burden of environmental change.</p>
