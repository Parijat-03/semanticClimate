<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Through our activist peers and our research online, we have learnt that our current system of colonialism, capitalism and exponential growth enables climate change and is getting in the way of us addressing it. In this system, big businesses and fossil fuel industries influence government and policies. Even if we change our individual behaviours, we will still have massive pollution, and people who are poor will still be the most impacted. It can get overwhelming to think we can live without greenhouse gas emissions in this current system, because everything we do will have an environmental impact. We are fighting for system change, which involves lifting the responsibility from individual people to governments for a sustainable future.</p>
