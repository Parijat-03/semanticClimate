CORDEX-CAS has 13 almost full cover of North Asia except parts of Russian Far East, and the ARCTIC-CORDEX domain covers 14 the northern regions. For CORDEX-CAS three RCMs (REMO, ALARO-0 and CLMcom) with different 15 boundary conditions were applied. Results show that RCMs have warmer biases for maximum temperatures 16 and colder biases for minimum temperatures (Top et al., submitted). The models also have a wet bias for 17 precipitation in the north during the winter months compared with the CRU data. Rain gauges, however, are 18 known to have problems in terms of measuring properly solid precipitation, e.g. drifting snow, and this can 19 greatly affect the accuracy of the CRU dataset over Northern Asia (Harris et al., 2014). 20 21 22 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 494.45; y1: 505.43; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="494.45" x1="298.64">Atlas.5.3.3.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections </span><span x0="27.66" y0="494.45" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 494.45; y1: 505.43; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23 Projections from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles shown in Figure Atlas.29: are for temperatures to 24 continue increasing into the future with further warming of over 2&#176;C&#8211;3&#176;C by mid-century. Temperature 25 change will be up to 8&#176;C in northern regions by the end of the 21st century under the higher emissions future 26 (with greater warming projected by the CMIP6 ensemble). Similarly, annual precipitation is projected to 27 continue increasing, by up to 30% more, by the end of the century with higher emissions.  28 29 Looking across a range of emissions futures, CMIP5 projections of temperature increases over Northern 30 Eurasia in the 21st century are 1.03&#176;C per 100 years, 3.11&#176;C per 100 years and 7.14&#176;C per 100 years under 31 the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively (Miao et al., 2014). Another study for permafrost 32 sub-regions in Eurasia by (Peng et al., 2019) indicate that the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios exhibit 33 statistically significant increases in annual temperature during the 21st century at a rate of 0.08&#176;C, 0.23&#176;C 34 and 0.72&#176;C per decade during the 2006&#8211;2100 period, respectively, resulting in an increase of ensemble area-35 averaged mean SAT for the 2081&#8211;2100 period relative to the 1986&#8211;2005 period of 1.68&#176;C (RCP2.6), 3.18&#176;C 36 (RCP4.5), or 6.41&#176;C (RCP8.5). This confirms that the warming rate of SAT in permafrost regions is faster 37 than global and in non-permafrost regions. 38 39 Projected future changes in the number of dry days can both amplify and damp precipitation intensity growth 40 expected in the process of climate warming (Sillmann et al., 2013c). Since precipitation is projected to 41 increase and the internal and inter-model uncertainties are relatively small at both annual and seasonal scales, 42 North Asia is projected to experience a decrease in dry extremes, such as decreases in days without 43 precipitation and the CDD index (Sillmann et al., 2013c). Further, increased extreme precipitation events and 44 increased flood risk are projected over the region (</span><span style="x0: 279.12; x1: 284.61; y0: 215.21; y1: 226.19; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="279.12" y0="215.21" x1="355.43">high confidence) </span><span x0="355.44" y0="215.21" x1="41.44" style="x0: 355.44; x1: 359.1; y0: 215.21; y1: 226.19; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(Shkolnik et al., 2018; Khlebnikova et 45 al., 2019c). 46 47 Studies on the projection of blocking in the 21st century using two scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 showed a 48 general increase in the blocking frequency and intensity for the Euro-Atlantic region in all seasons. There is 49 also an increasing likelihood of extreme winter and summer conditions due to the total blocking duration 50 longer than seven weeks. Changes of the opposite sign are characteristic for the Northern Hemisphere as a 51 whole with no change in the interannual or interdecadal variability (Lupo and Kininmonth, 2013; Mokhov et 52 al., 2014). 53 54 As for regional climate models, North Asia is partly included with the Arctic (northern parts) and Central-55 </span></div></body></html>
