A union, chosen by at least a simple majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, represents all the workers in that unit. The employer must deal exclusively with the union chosen by the majority, and the union must represent all the employees in the unit fairly and in good faith. A union security clause, negotiated by the employer and the union as a part of the collective bargaining agreement, permits the union to charge a fee for representation to those who do not want to join the union and pay full union dues. Section 14(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">n.d</xref>) allows states to enact laws, colloquially and often confusingly known as right-to-work laws, that prohibit negotiation of such clauses (NLRA, Section 14(b)). As of 2020, twenty-seven states had enacted such laws. (National Conference of State Legislatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). While most of these laws were passed in the mid-twentieth century, anti-union forces succeeded in adding six states to the total since 2012, including the important Rust Belt states of Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin (National Conference of State Legislatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>; Bales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>, 7).</p>
