For instance, Pacific Asia includes Singapore, which consumed 633 GJ per capita that year, and Bangladesh, which consumed only 9 GJ per capita. Moreover, the use of traditional biofuels&#8212;such as woody phytomass, charcoal, and crop residue&#8212;is very difficult to estimate compared to crude oil, for which there is detailed information about virtually all that enters the market (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>: 78). However, traditional biofuels are a common source of energy in low-income countries. Roughly 2.5 billion people are estimated to rely on such energy sources for cooking and heating (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>: 87). In contrast, roughly 15% of the world&#8217;s population live in high-income economies and claim nearly 45% of all commercial energy (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>: 234).</p>
