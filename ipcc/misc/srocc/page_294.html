It can lead to a&#160;decrease in basal cover and the accumulation of moribund, unpalatable biomass that inhibits primary production (Manson et al. 2007; Scholes 2009). The utilisation of the grass sward through light to moderate grazing stimulates the growth of biomass and basal cover, and allows water services to be sustained over time (Papanastasis et al. 2017; Scholes 2009). Even moderate to heavy grazing in periods of higher rainfall may be sustainable, but constant heavy grazing during dry periods, and especially droughts, can lead to a&#160;reduction in basal cover, SOC, biological soil crusts, ecosystem services and an accelerated erosion (</span><span style="x0: 61.84; x1: 66.42; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="61.84" y0="555.55" x1="119.26">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 119.21; x1: 121.49; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="119.21" y0="555.55" x1="123.37">, </span><span style="x0: 124.56; x1: 127.37; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="124.56" y0="555.55" x1="181.93">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 181.88; x1: 184.52; y0: 555.55; y1: 565.05; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="181.88" y0="555.55" x1="307.29">) (Archer et al. 2017; Conant and Paustian 2003;&#160;D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2013; Geist and Lambin 2004; Havstad et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2007; Manzano and N&#225;var 2000; Pointing and Belnap 2012; Weber et al. 2016). For this reason, the inclusion of drought forecasts and contingency planning in grazing and &#64257;re management programmes is crucial to avoid deserti&#64257;cation (Smith and Foran 1992; Torell et al. 2010). It is an important component of avoiding and reducing early degradation. Although grasslands systems may be relatively resilient and can often recover from a&#160;moderately degraded state (Khishigbayar et al. 2015; Porensky et al. 2016), if a&#160;tipping point has been exceeded, restoration to a&#160;historic state may not be economical or ecologically feasible (D&#8217;Odorico et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="59.25" right="307.31" top="399.57"><span style="x0: 59.25; x1: 63.46; y0: 399.57; y1: 409.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.25" y0="399.57" x1="307.31">Together with livestock management (Table&#160;6.5), the use of &#64257;re is an integral part of rangeland management, which can be applied to remove moribund and unpalatable forage, exotic weeds and woody species (Archer et al. 2017). Fire has less of an effect on SOC and soil nutrients in comparison to grazing (Abril et al. 2005), yet elevated &#64257;re frequency has been observed to lead to a&#160;decrease in soil carbon and nitrogen (Abril et al. 2005; Bikila et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2000; Pellegrini et al. 2017). Although the impact of climate change on &#64257;re frequency and intensity may not be clear due to its differing impact on fuel accumulation, suitable weather conditions and sources of ignition (Abatzoglou et al. 2018; Littell et al. 2018; Moritz et al. 2012), there is an increasing use of prescribed &#64257;re to address several global change phenomena, for example, the spread of invasive species and bush encroachment, as well as the threat of intense runaway &#64257;res (Fernandes et al. 2013; McCaw 2013; van Wilgen et al. 2010). Cross-Chapter Box&#160;3&#160;in Chapter&#160;2&#160;provides a&#160;further review of the interaction between &#64257;re and climate change. </span></div><div left="59.25" right="307.32" top="183.59"><span style="x0: 59.25; x1: 63.46; y0: 183.59; y1: 193.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.25" y0="183.59" x1="307.32">There is often much emphasis on reducing and reversing the degradation of rangelands due to the wealth of bene&#64257;ts they provide, especially in the context of assisting dryland communities to adapt to climate change (Webb et al. 2017; Woollen et al. 2016). The emerging concept of ecosystem-based adaptation has highlighted the broad range of important ecosystem services that healthy rangelands can provide in a&#160;resilient manner to local residents and downstream economies (Kloos and Renaud 2016; Reid et al. 2018). In terms of climate change mitigation, the contribution of rangelands, woodland and sub-humid dry forest (e.g.,&#160;Miombo woodland in south-central Africa) is often undervalued due to relatively low carbon stocks </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.81" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.34; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.61" x1="565.81">per hectare.

Dependent on the type and intensity of encroachment, it may lead to a&#160;net loss of ecosystem services and be viewed as a&#160;form of deserti&#64257;cation (Dougill et al. 2016;&#160;O&#8217;Connor et al. 2014). However, there are circumstances where bush encroachment may lead to a&#160;net increase in ecosystem services, especially at intermediate levels of encroachment, where the ability of the landscape to produce fodder for livestock is retained, while the production of wood and associated products increases (Eldridge et al. 2011; Eldridge and Soliveres 2014). This may be particularly important in regions such as southern Africa and India where over 65% of rural households depend on fuelwood from surrounding landscapes as well as livestock production (Komala and Prasad 2016; Makonese et al. 2017; Shackleton and Shackleton 2004).</span></div><div left="317.76" right="565.8" top="459.55"><span style="x0: 317.76; x1: 321.98; y0: 459.55; y1: 469.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.76" y0="459.55" x1="565.8">This variable relationship between the level of encroachment, carbon stocks, biodiversity, provision of water and pastoral value (Eldridge and Soliveres 2014) can present a&#160;conundrum to policymakers, especially when considering the goals of three Rio Conventions: UNFCCC, UNCCD and UNCBD. Clearing intense bush encroachment may improve species diversity, rangeland productivity, the provision of water and decrease deserti&#64257;cation, thereby contributing to the goals of the UNCBD and UNCCD as well as the adaptation aims of the UNFCCC.

Namibia has a&#160;national programme, currently in its early stages, aimed at clearing woody species through mechanical measures (harvesting of trees) as well as the application of arboricides (Smit et al. 2015). However, the long-term success of clearance and subsequent improved &#64257;re and grazing management remains to be evaluated, especially restoration back towards an &#8216;original open grassland state&#8217;.
