<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our paper has several limitations. First, we offer a cross-sectional analysis of wind turbine count, not a longitudinal one. As climate policy has evolved over the years, longitudinal analysis can add more nuance to how the policy environment might shape the evolution of the wind energy industry on tribal lands. Second, our dependent variable is the count of wind turbines and not wind installed capacity. This issue will become more important in the future as wind turbines with vastly larger generation capacity are beginning to arrive on the market. While this technology so far tends to be focused on offshore turbines where not only the wind flows are stronger but also the aesthetic issues are less relevant, it is possible that eventually, these bigger turbines will be installed onshore as well. Thus, future work should seek data on wind capacity as opposed to counting turbines.</p>
