<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It is a specificity of the CS Track project that it gains insight in CS practices by applying computational analytics techniques to existing websites and social media channels that contain manifestations of CS activities. Relevant computational techniques include data and text mining, semantic analyses (esp. &#8220;Explicit Semantic Analysis&#8221; or ESA, cf. Gabrilovich and Markovitch, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) as well as Social Network Analysis or SNA (Wasserman and Faust, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The sources of primary information to be processed by analytics are human-created content in the form of natural language and formal texts. Some of this information, such as short descriptions of CS projects, is directly available in the CS Track database. Additional information can be gained by harvesting from CS platforms and project websites. Here, again, the database serves as an entry point providing indexical information such as names, acronyms, and web links. Techniques of Named Entity Recognition (NER) allow for extracting information on persons, institutions, geographical locations, etc. from given texts (Nadeau and Sekine, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This information can be useful to locate-connections between projects and other institutions or support anonymization of personal information.</p>
