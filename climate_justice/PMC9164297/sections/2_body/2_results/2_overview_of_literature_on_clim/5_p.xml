<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0070">Based on the review of SDGs and sustainable adaptation (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we identified seven main methodological categories of co-production and other participatory approaches to knowledge production. These include labs, workshops (stakeholder, scenario, participatory), science-policy platforms, task groups, participatory action research, networks and incubators, and co-design of policy solutions. By far, the most widely used methods for co-production are workshops of different configurations. We argue that if this method is the sole participatory measure for co-production, it is not likely that the outcome will have a transformative impact on the system of interest. A combination of methods, however, as listed in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, will more likely result in a long-lasting transformative impact. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows how we rank the degree of interventions in the different methods. Methods that are intended to instigate system change as outlined in the reviewed literature include labs, co-design, and participatory action research, and we provide a few examples of this below.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Methods for co-production of knowledge found in the reviewed literature.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Characteristics</th><th>Number of publications in corpus</th><th>Employed by</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Labs, Incubators</td><td>Testing solutions with stakeholders</td><td>7</td><td><xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Hjerpe et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">DeLosRios-White et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>; Patel et al., 2020; <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boeri et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Wamsler et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Workshops (stakeholder-, scenario-, participatory)</td><td>Events that bring researchers and stakeholders together, employing various methods for facilitating collaboration and mutual learning</td><td>15</td><td><xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boeri et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Ajibade et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Greenhill et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Frantzeskaki et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Adegun and Olusoga, 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Zougmor&#233; et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Capitani et al., 2019</xref>; Chae et al., 2020; <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Scoones et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziervogel, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>; Baum et al., 2021; Estrella et al., 2016</td></tr><tr><td>Science-policy platform</td><td>Enduring meeting places for researchers and stakeholders, similarities with networks</td><td>1</td><td><xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Zougmor&#233; et al., 2019</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Participatory action research</td><td>Interventionist approach where researchers engage in development of new policies or solutions</td><td>1</td><td><xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Trott et al., 2018</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Networks</td><td>Formalized collaborations between stakeholder organizations and research institutions for exchange of knowledge</td><td>3</td><td><xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Nagy et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Huber-Sannwald et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Hellin et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Citizen science</td><td>Stakeholders and knowledge users collect data and conduct other research tasks</td><td>1</td><td>Patel et al., 2020</td></tr><tr><td>Co-design</td><td>Development of solutions with stakeholders that are implemented and/or tested.</td><td>4</td><td><xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2020</xref>; Baum et al., 2021; <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Boeri et al., 2017</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
