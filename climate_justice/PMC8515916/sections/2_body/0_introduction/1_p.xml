Slow onset climate processes, such as sea-level rise, food and water insecurity and desertification; and fast climate events, such as floods and hurricanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; impose direct and indirect risks to human health. These risks interact with pre-existing low resilience and adaptive capacity, lack of development and low preparedness, to drive human migration. The relationship between climate change, migration and health is heterogenous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and mediated by context-dependent political, social, economic, and demographic drivers of mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While migration is often an adaptive solution to climate change, it can also be maladaptive, and negatively impact human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The climate-migration-health nexus was explored from diverse perspectives at the Center for International Health of the Ludwig Maximilians Universit&#228;t (CIH<sup>LMU</sup>) 2021 Symposium &#8220;Global Health Perspectives: Climate Change and Migration&#8221; on March 12th, 2021.</p>
