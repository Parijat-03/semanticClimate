The heatwave in Russia was extreme in both temperature (over 40&#176;C) and duration (from July to mid-August in 2010). This reduced wheat yields by approximately one third (Wegren 2011; Marchand et al. 2016). Simultaneously, in the Indus Valley in Pakistan, unprecedented rainfall led to &#64258;ooding, affecting the lives and livelihoods of 20&#160;million people. There is evidence that these effects were both linked and made more likely through climate change (Mann et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.05" top="555.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 555.54; y1: 565.04; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="555.54" x1="299.05">In response to its shortfall in yields, Russia imposed an export ban in order to maintain local food supplies. Other countries responded in a&#160;largely uncoordinated ways, each of them driven by internal politics as well as national self-interests (Jones and Hiller 2017). Overall, these measures led to rapid price rises on the global markets (Welton 2011), partly through panic buying, but&#160;also through &#64257;nancial speculation (Spratt 2013). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.11" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="447.56" x1="299.11">Analysis of responses to higher food prices in the developing world showed that lower-income groups responded by taking on more employment, reducing food intake, limiting expenditures, spending savings (if available), and participating in demonstrations. People often identi&#64257;ed their problems as stemming from collusion between powerful incumbent interests (e.g.,&#160;of politicians and big business) and disregard for the poor (Hossain and Green 2011). This politicised social response helped spark food-related civil protest, including riots, across a&#160;range of countries in 2010&#8211;2011 (Natalini et al. 2017). In Pakistan, food price rises were exacerbated by the economic impacts of the &#64258;oods, which further contributed to food-related riots in 2010. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.06" top="279.57"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.94; y0: 279.57; y1: 289.07; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="279.57" x1="299.06">Price spikes also impact on food security in the developed world. In the UK, global commodity price in&#64258;ation in&#64258;uenced local food prices, increasing food-price in&#64258;ation by about &#64257;ve times at the end of 2010. Comparing household purchases over the &#64257;ve-year period from 2007 to 2011 showed that the amount of food bought declined, on average, by&#160;4.2%, whilst paying 12% more for it. The lowest income decile spent 17% more by 2011 than they did in 2007 (Holding et al. 2013; Tadasse et al. 2016). Consumers also saved money by trading down for cheaper alternatives. For the poorest, in the extreme situation, food became unaffordable: the Trussell Trust, a&#160;charity supplying emergency food handouts for people in crisis, noted a&#160;50% increase in handouts in 2010.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="197.81" top="87.42"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.4; y0: 87.42; y1: 97.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="87.42" x1="197.81">1.8.2 Migration and con&#64258;ict</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="711.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 711.52; y1: 721.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="711.52" x1="571.75">Since the IPCC AR5 (Porter et al. 2014; Cramer et al. 2014), new work has advanced multi-factor methodological issues related to migration and con&#64258;ict (e.g.,&#160;Kelley et al. 2015, 2017; Werrell et al. 2015; Challinor et al. 2018; Pasini et al. 2018).

Food insecurity is a&#160;critical &#8216;push&#8217; factor driving international migration, along with con&#64258;ict, income inequality, and population growth.
