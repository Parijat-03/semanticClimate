Competing unions in a workplace may lead to better representation (Bronfenbrenner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>). Representing only members eliminates the problem of free riders and the resentment of members who must pay for representation for nonmembers (Brooks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). A legal challenge by one union claims that forcing it to represent nonmembers who oppose the union violates the First Amendment speech rights of the Union and its members (Sweeney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>, Para. 24). The case is still pending, and like the cases attacking exclusive representation brought by union opponents, it poses a challenge to the existing system of labor relations (Sweeney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2019</xref>).</p>
