In particular, the influence of both injunctive and descriptive social norms of participation emerged. The social environment greatly influenced which initiatives the respondents were involved in. The extended SIMCA model (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2011</xref>) does not present social norms as a stand-alone predictor, but it is inherent in the predictor of (politicized) social identity in the model. Other researchers (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">St&#252;rmer and Simon, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Bamberg, 2014</xref>) postulated that social norms are a strong predictor of participation in collective action, or at least mediate the predictive influence of social identities on participation intention.</p>
