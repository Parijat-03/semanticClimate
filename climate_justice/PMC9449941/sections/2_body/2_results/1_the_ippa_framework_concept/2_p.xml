<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par17">At the heart of the approach is the <italic>design of policy packages</italic> that are capable of triggering the two transformation paths of &#8220;multi- and inter-modality&#8221; and &#8220;alternative drive systems&#8221;, here within the case study of urban passenger transport. The policy packages were developed using a mixed-method design consisting of a literature review, a participatory Group Delphi workshop, and a practice actors&#8217; feedback workshop. In this paper, we will illustrate IPPA implementation according to the &#8220;alternative drive&#8221; case. The <italic>assessment</italic> of the policy packages comprised individual impact studies elaborated by contributions from ENavi project research groups. These were equally important, since each study&#8217;s method is characterized by specific strengths and weaknesses, and only their combination leads to robust results. The <italic>evaluation</italic> integrated and synthesized the individual impact studies into a coherent evaluation matrix. The integration aimed to deliver key insights on progress towards the mobility transition (intended impacts), and unintended side-effects and negative consequences. Finally, in the <italic>discourse</italic> phase, we applied several participatory methods linking discourse with the other framework phases. The policy package design, for instance, processed a Group Delphi workshop evaluating promising pathways and policy interventions, while the impact profiles of the policy packages were subjected to discussion and review by members of &#8220;competence teams&#8221; and further practice actors. The competence teams were a structural element of the ENavi project which included individuals from the economic and service sector, civil society, and administration concerned with issues around electricity, heat and/or mobility.</p>
