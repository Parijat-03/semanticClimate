That is, the physical scarcity of temperature limit or carbon budget leaves little room for politics, being preoccupied by managerial control of the global climate. It may also lead to a &#8216;scarcity mindset&#8217; that is to narrow down (or &#8216;tunnel&#8217;) our cognitive capacity to imagine the alternative, political possibilities of living with a changing climate. To go beyond the scarcity discourse, I argue, we should embrace more the discourse of <italic>emancipation</italic>.</p>
