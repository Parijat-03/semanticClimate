For instance, Bessembinder et al. (2018) provide an overview of European national climate change 3 scenario programs. In most programs use is made of CMIP5 (or earlier) global climate change ensembles 4 driven by an agreed set of greenhouse-gas emission scenarios, followed by downscaling using RCMs and/or 5 statistical methods, in order to arrive at regionally representative hydrometeorological indicators of climate 6 change. In some cases output of a selection of downscaled global and regional models is provided to users 7 (Whetton et al., 2012; Daron et al., 2018). Uptake by users is strongly dependent on guidance provided on 8 the motivation of the selection, the clarity of the downscaling procedure, and further steps needed to tailor 9 the information to the local scale (Lemos et al., 2012). More comprehensive programs provide probabilistic 10 climate information by careful interpretation, correction and aggregation of ensembles of model outputs 11 (Lowe et al., 2018). The information provided is generally tailored to professional practitioners with 12 expertise to interpret and process this probabilistic information. It is argued that this top-down probabilistic 13 information chain is not able to highlight the essential climate change information for users, and alternative 14 bottom-up approaches are encouraged (Frigg et al., 2013).  15 16 17 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.4; y0: 557.69; y1: 568.67; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="557.69" x1="495.92">Atlas.6.1.4 Inferring regional climate change from an assessment of changes in driving processes </span><span x0="27.66" y0="557.69" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 557.69; y1: 568.67; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18 19 Regional climate is governed by a mixture of physical drivers, such as circulation patterns, seasonal 20 monsoons, annual cycles of snow, regional land-atmosphere feedbacks, etc. Global warming may affect 21 regional climate characteristics by altering the dynamics of their drivers. Regional climate change 22 information can be generated by mapping the consequences of changing the frequency, intensity or impact of 23 drivers. As an example, the KNMI climate change scenarios are constructed by aggregating climate change 24 information from a large ensemble of regional climate projections, and stratifying these according to levels 25 of global warming and the projected change of patterns of atmospheric circulation, an important driver of the 26 regional atmospheric moisture balance and precipitation characteristics (Lenderink et al., 2014). Each of the 27 climate change scenario thus created is based on a physical climate storyline referring to these major drivers. 28 29 30 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 392.27; y1: 403.25; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="392.27" x1="227.33">Atlas.6.1.5 Storylines and narratives </span><span x0="27.66" y0="392.27" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 392.27; y1: 403.25; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">31 32 Communicating the full extent of available information on future climate for a region, including a 33 quantification of uncertainties, can act as a barrier to the uptake and use of such information (Lemos et al., 34 2012; Daron et al., 2018). To address the need to simplify and increase the relevance of information for 35 specific contexts, recent studies have adopted narrative and storyline approaches (Hazeleger et al., 2015; 36 Shepherd et al., 2018b) (see Chapter 1 for definitions, and Chapter 10 for further discussion on these 37 concepts). Narratives and storylines (see Section 1.4.4 and Section 10.5.3) can also be used to help describe 38 relationships between physical climate processes across spatial and temporal scales, and how these influence 39 the climate of a region (e.g., Zappa et al., 2017; Dessai et al., 2018) but here their role in communicating 40 future climate information to address societal challenges is emphasized. 41 42 Some uses of climate narratives also focus on the process of their construction and demonstrate the added 43 value of co-produced narratives to enhance knowledge integration in decision-making contexts (e.g., de 44 Bruijn et al., 2016). The success of co-production depends on the degree to which clarity of underlying 45 values and purposes of the different co-production partners is ensured (Bremer and Meisch, 2017). An IPCC 46 expert meeting on assessing and combining multi-model climate projections (IPCC, 2010) recommended 47 that in cases when quantitative information is limited or missing, regional climate assessments could use 48 narratives in addition or as an alternative. It may now be argued that information needs not be missing or 49 limited for narratives to have value, both as a tool to communicate climate information and as a process for 50 knowledge integration. 51 52 53 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
