Young reaches this conclusion via an argument based on analogical reasoning, which runs as follows. First, creating a new person is creating a set of claims on natural resources, and hence qua impact it is equivalent to other actions that entail a claim to such natural resources, such as consumption. Second, we morally condemn overconsumption because of the environmental harms it causes. Third, since there is no morally relevant distinction between overconsumption and procreation, we have to condemn procreation just as much (or as little) for the ecological harms it causes as we have to condemn overconsumption. As MacIver puts it, Young reaches the conclusion that &#8220;there is no morally relevant distinction between an individual claiming a large quantity of natural goods for her own personal use, and an individual claiming a large quantity of natural goods for the use of her offspring. There is nothing inherently special or defensible about the latter&#8221;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref></p>
