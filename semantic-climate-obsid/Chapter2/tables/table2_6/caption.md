Table 2.6 - Comparing cumulative future CO2 emissions estimates from existing and proposed long-lived infrastructures by sector.


Future CO2 emissions estimates are reported from the “year of dataset”. Note that in some cases, the totals may not correspond to the sum of underlying sectors
due to rounding (based on Tong et al., 2019). Initial estimates of future CO2 emissions from fossil fuel infrastructures by Davis et al. (2010) are considerably lower
than more recent estimates by Smith et al. (2019) and Tong et al. (2019) due to substantial growth in fossil energy infrastructure as represented by more recent
data. Estimates presented here are rounded to two significant digits.
