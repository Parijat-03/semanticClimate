<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Paris Agreement refers to the party countries in three categories: developed party countries, developing party countries, and the least developed party countries. Under Article 4 of the PA, each party country is free to decide its own &#8220;common but differentiated responsibilities&#8221; (p. 6) according to their respective capabilities and national circumstances. Developed party countries, under Articles 9, 10, and 11 of the PA, are obliged to provide support to the developing party countries, and especially to those parties who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as the least developed countries.</p>
