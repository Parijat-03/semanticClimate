CS Track involves nine partners from seven countries with backgrounds in social and educational studies, computer science and data analytics, as well as research into CS. Such an approach strengthens the findings, provides more comprehensive data, increased validity, and ultimately enhances our understanding of the state of CS. Methods utilized by CS Track comprise literature reviews, content analysis (including web and social media content), exploring discourse related to CS in social networks and carrying out surveys and interviews with key stakeholders in the field.</p>
