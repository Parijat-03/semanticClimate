For example, in the Philippines local CM is typically funded out-of-pocket by individuals, while MR is funded through designated grants from the National Housing Authority, Department of Interior and Local Government, and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ajibade, 2019</xref>). In the US, funding for migrants and refugees comes from the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. Whereas MR programs are funded by grants from two major sources: (i) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which oversees the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program (FMA); and (ii) the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which manages the Disaster Recovery Buyout Program (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Freudenberg et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding these differences in compensation and funding mechanisms is crucial especially for frontline communities and their advocates.</p>
