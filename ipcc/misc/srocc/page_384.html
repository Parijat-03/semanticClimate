For example, coffee is expected to be highly sensitive to both temperature and precipitation changes, both in terms of growth and yield, and in terms of increasing problems of pests (Ovalle-Rivera et al. 2015). Some studies conclude that the global area of coffee production will decrease by 50% (Bunn et al. 2015). Due to increased heat stress, the suitability of Arabica coffee is expected to deteriorate in Mesoamerica, while it can improve in high-altitude areas in South America. The general pattern is that the climatic suitability for Arabica coffee will deteriorate at low altitudes of the tropics as well as at the higher latitudes (Ovalle-Rivera et al. 2015). This means that climate change in and of itself can render unsustainable previously sustainable land-use and land management practices, and vice versa (Laderach et al. 2011). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.61" top="399.54"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 399.54; y1: 409.04; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="399.54" x1="307.61">Rangelands are projected to change in complex ways due to climate change.

Coastal regions are also characterised by high population density, particularly in Asia (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam), whereas the highest population increase in coastal regions is projected in Africa (East Africa, Egypt, and West Africa) (Neumann et al. 2015). For coastal regions worldwide, and particularly in developing countries with high population density in low-lying coastal areas, limiting the warming to&#160;1.5&#176;C to&#160;2.0&#176;C will have major socio-economic bene&#64257;ts compared with higher temperature scenarios (IPCC 2018a; Nicholls et al. 2018).

With signi&#64257;cant socio-economic effects, the physical impacts of projected sea level rise, notably coastal erosion, have received considerable scienti&#64257;c attention (Nicholls et al. 2011; Rahmstorf 2010; Hauer et al. 2016). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.06" top="615.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 615.56; y1: 625.06; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="615.56" x1="566.06">Rates of coastal erosion or recession will increase due to rising sea levels and, in some regions, also in combination with increasing oceans waves (Day and Hodges 2018; Thomson and Rogers 2014; McInnes et al. 2011; Mori et al. 2010), lack or absence of sea-ice (Savard et al. 2009; Thomson and Rogers 2014) thawing of permafrost (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), and changing cyclone paths (Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi 2017; Lin and Emanuel 2016a). The respective role of the different climate factors in the coastal erosion process will vary spatially. Some studies have shown that the role of sea level rise on the coastal erosion process can be less important than other climate factors, like wave heights, changes in the frequency of the storms, and the cryogenic processes (Ruggiero 2013; Savard et al. 2009). Therefore, in order to have a&#160;complete picture of the potential effects of sea level rise on rates of coastal erosion, it is crucial to consider the combined effects of the aforementioned climate controls and the geomorphology of the coast under study. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="411.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 411.58; y1: 421.08; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="411.58" x1="566.1">Coastal wetlands around the world are sensitive to sea level rise. Projections of the impacts on global coastlines are inconclusive, with some projections suggesting that 20% to 90% (depending on sea level rise scenario) of present day wetlands will disappear during the 21st century (Spencer et al. 2016). Another study, which included natural feedback processes and management responses, suggested that coastal wetlands may actually increase (Schuerch et al. 2018). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="315.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 321.92; y0: 315.59; y1: 325.09; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="315.59" x1="566.12">Low-lying coastal areas in the tropics are particularly subject to the combined effect of sea level rise and increasing intensity of tropical cyclones, conditions that, in many cases, pose limits to adaptation (Section&#160;4.8.5.1). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="255.6"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 255.6; y1: 265.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="255.6" x1="566.13">Many large coastal deltas are subject to the additional stress of shrinking deltas as a&#160;consequence of the combined effect of reduced sediment loads from rivers due to damming and water use, and land subsidence resulting from extraction of ground water or natural gas, and aquaculture (Higgins et al. 2013; Tessler et al. 2016; Minderhoud et al. 2017; Tessler et al. 2015; Brown and Nicholls 2015; Szabo et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019; Shirzaei and B&#252;rgmann 2018; Wang et al. 2018; Fuangswasdi et al. 2019).
