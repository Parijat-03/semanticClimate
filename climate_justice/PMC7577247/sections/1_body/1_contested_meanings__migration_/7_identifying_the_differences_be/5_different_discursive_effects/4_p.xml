<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0105">In the case of the IDJC, the Tribal Council organized and advocated for community relocation to mainland Louisiana for nearly two decades before being awarded a $48 million grant in 2016 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Boyd, 2019</xref>). The disbursement of this fund was through Louisiana&#8217;s Office of Community Development-Disaster Recovery Unit (<xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Herman, 2018</xref>). Despite having institutional support, the IDJC relocation process was fraught with problems. The surrounding community, mostly Whites, resisted the tribes&#8217; resettlement, claiming their presence would be problematic and may lead to more flooding (<xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Herman, 2018</xref>). The State also made changes to the tribe&#8217;s original resettlement plan in ways that did not reflect their goals and objectives (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Dermansky, 2019</xref>). For example, the tribe could lose their rights over previous lands if they accept the State&#8217;s current plans. This example therefore offers a cautionary tale in the context of MR.</p>
