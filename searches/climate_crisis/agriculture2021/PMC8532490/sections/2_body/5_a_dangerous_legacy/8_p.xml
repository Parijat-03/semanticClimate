The negotiations were accelerated to create a policy product to contribute to the UNFSS, and were marred by careless methodologies, power plays, and palpable hostility to human rights and regulation of trade, investment, financial markets and corporations. Instead of embracing a holistic, rights based food systems lens and recognizing the public purpose of food systems, the VGFSyN uphold the interests of agricultural exporting countries, highlight the role of the private sector and global value chains,&#160;and advance market led solutions to address FSN concerns.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> The recently concluded negotiations on <italic>CFS Policy Recommendations on Agroecological and other Innovative Approaches</italic> were similarly subjected to time pressures to fit the schedule of the UNFSS Pre-Summit in July 2021, which resulted in sessions without interpretation, and unequal participation by MSs and the CSM, thus subverting inclusive consensus building. The adopted document conflates agroecology with diametrically opposed approaches such as sustainable intensification and the use of agrotoxics.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21">21</xref></p>
