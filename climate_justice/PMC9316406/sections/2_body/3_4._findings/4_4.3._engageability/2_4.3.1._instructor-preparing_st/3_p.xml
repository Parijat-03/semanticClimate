GSW learning and training require that students be mindful of the marks of healthy community engagement, supported by continuous and consistent policy and program support, during both disaster and non-disaster scenarios, and consistently promote that the lessons learned from the disaster scenarios be reflected in the policy and program adjustment. Social work educators must assert that community engagement and development are among the fundamental components of social work profession, that support almost all types of social work practice and individual and collective health and well-being. GSW-specific training can be provided for prospective community-based social workers to enhance their roles in community engagement regarding supporting residents&#8217; health and well-being in disaster and non-disaster settings.</p>
