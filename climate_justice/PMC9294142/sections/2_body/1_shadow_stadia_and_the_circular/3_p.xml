(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) defined the concept of circular economy as a systematic approach to address and decrease urban sustainability issues through optimization of materials and energy. Kirchherr et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) explained CE as keeping energy and material flows within consumption and production by using long-lasting design, material and energy efficiency, by reusing and remanufacturing rather than recycling. Reusing can be defined as using a product several times without changing the design or material, while remanufacturing explains how a used product is renovated or maintained to the same standard as the new or original product. Recycling is where a product is destroyed to be used for manufacturing new products (Glader, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
