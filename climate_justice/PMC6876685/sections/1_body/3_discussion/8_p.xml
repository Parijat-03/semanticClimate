<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Returning to the quote at the beginning of this paper, the results of our study help us understand how climate change coursework might be informative, while also leading some students to report having an &#8220;anxiety attack.&#8221; Our results suggest that the quoted student is far from alone in being very worried about climate change: By the end of the semester, 58% of participants reported being very worried. In comparison, only 21% of Americans are &#8220;very worried&#8221; about climate change (Leiserowitz et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Climate change can influence mental health, both as a result of climate&#8208;related disasters and as a result of more gradual changes to climate (Trombley, Chalupka, &amp; Anderko, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Notably, climate change can elicit <italic>solastalgia</italic>: &#8220;the pain or distress caused by the loss of, or inability to derive, solace connected to the negatively perceived state of one's home environment&#8221; (Albrecht et al., <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>, p. S96; see also Albrecht, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). We hypothesize that the high level of worry expressed by our participants may result from them becoming more certain that climate change is happening and more aware of the immediacy of its impacts, while at the same time retaining pessimistic views about whether humans will actually act to reduce climate change. Importantly, and perhaps counter&#8208;intuitively, coursework that focuses too narrowly on readerly climate literacy may create new barriers to writerly climate action.</p>
