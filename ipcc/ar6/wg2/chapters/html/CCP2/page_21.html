However, rapid global mitigation of greenhouse gases significantly reduces risks to coastal cities and settlements (C&amp;S), and, crucially, buys time for adaptation.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.32" top="643.06"><span x0="72.14" y0="643.06" x1="554.32" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 78.64; y0: 643.06; y1: 652.06; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Appropriate actions to reduce climate change risks in coastal C&amp;S depend on the scale and speed of coastal change interacting with unfolding local circumstances, reflecting the hazards, exposure, vulnerability and response to risks.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.33" top="613.06"><span x0="72.14" y0="613.06" x1="554.33" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 74.64; y0: 613.06; y1: 622.06; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">&#8216;Hard&#8217; protection, like dikes and seawalls, can reduce the risk of flooding for several metres of SLR in some coastal C&amp;S. These are most cost effective for densely populated cities and some islands, but may be unaffordable for poorer regions. Although these measures reduce the likelihood of coastal flooding, residual risk remains, and hard protection typically has negative consequences for natural systems. In low-lying protected coastal zones, draining river and excess water will increasingly be hampered, eventually requiring pumping or transferring to alternative strategies.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.27" top="535.08"><span x0="72.14" y0="535.08" x1="554.27" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 81.14; y0: 535.08; y1: 544.08; width: 9.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Whereas structures can disrupt natural beach morphology processes, sediment-based protection replenishes beaches. These have lower impact on adjacent beaches and coastal ecology and lower costs for construction and maintenance compared to hard structures. Another form of &#8216;soft&#8217; protection involves establishing, rehabilitating and preserving coastal ecosystems, like marshes, mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs and dunes, providing &#8216;soft&#8217; protection against storm surges, reducing coastal erosion and offering additional benefits including food, materials and carbon sequestration. However, these are less effective where there is limited space in the coastal zone, limited sediment supply and under higher rates of SLR.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.24" top="445.1"><span x0="72.14" y0="445.1" x1="554.24" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 77.64; y0: 445.1; y1: 454.1; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Coastal settlements can &#8216;avoid&#8217; new flood and erosion risks by preventing development in areas exposed to current and future coastal hazards. Where development already exists, settlements can &#8216;accommodate&#8217; climate change impacts through, among other things, land-use zoning, raising ground or buildings above storm surge levels, installing flood-proofing measures within and outside properties, and early warning systems. Improving the capacity of urban drainage, incorporating nature-based solutions within urban areas and managing land upstream of settlements to reduce runoff from the hinterland reduces the risk of compound flood events. More radically, land can also be reclaimed from the sea, which offers opportunities for further development but has impacts on the natural system and wider implications for the trajectory of development.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.25" top="343.12"><span x0="72.14" y0="343.12" x1="554.25" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 77.64; y0: 343.12; y1: 352.12; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Coastal risks and impacts such as floods, loss of fisheries or tourism, or salinization of groundwater require people to change behaviour to adapt, such as diversifying livelihoods or moving away from low-lying areas. Currently, most of these practices are reactive and help people adjust to/cope with current impacts. While a critical part of coastal adaptation, changing behaviour can be enabled by supportive policies and financial structures aligned with sociocultural values and worldviews.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.24" top="277.13"><span x0="72.14" y0="277.13" x1="554.24" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 81.14; y0: 277.13; y1: 286.13; width: 9.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Where risks are very high or resources are insufficient to manage risks, submergence or erosion of coastal C&amp;S will be inevitable, requiring &#8216;retreat&#8217; from the coastline. This is the outlook for millions of people in the coming decades, including those living in river deltas, Arctic communities, small islands and low-lying small settlements in poor and wealthy nations. Whilst the impacts of retreat on communities can be devastating, the prospect of many C&amp;S and even whole nations being permanently inundated in the coming centuries underscores the imperative for urgent action.</span></div><div left="72.14" right="554.27" top="199.14"><span x0="72.14" y0="199.14" x1="554.27" style="x0: 72.14; x1: 77.64; y0: 199.14; y1: 208.14; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; font-family: QKWZFC+FrutigerLTPro-Roman;">Crucial to making choices about how to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change in coastal C&amp;S is to establish institutions and governance practices supporting climate resilient development&#8212;a mix and sequence of mitigation and adaptation actions&#8212;that are fair, just and inclusive as well as technically and economically effective across successive generations.</span></div></body></html>
