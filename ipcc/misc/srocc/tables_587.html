      <td>Biodiversity\nconservation</td>
      <td>Biodiversity conservation refers to practices aimed\nat maintaining components of biological diversity. It\nincludes conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats,\nmaintenance and recovery of viable populations of\nspecies in their natural surroundings (in-situ conservation)\nand, in the case of domesticated or cultivated species,\nin the surroundings where they have developed their\ndistinctive properties outside their natural habitats (ex-situ\nconservation). Examples of biodiversity conservation\nmeasures are establishment of protected areas to achieve\nspecific conservation objectives, preservation of biodiversity\nhotspots, land management to recover natural habitats,\ninterventions to expand or control selective plant or animal\nspecies in productive lands or rangelands (e.g., rewilding).</td>
      <td>Biodiversity conservation measures interact with the\nclimate system through many complex processes, which\ncan have either positive or negative impacts. For example,\nestablishment of protected areas can increase carbon\nstorage in vegetation and soil, and tree planting to\npromote species richness and natural habitats can enhance\ncarbon uptake capacity of ecosystems. Management of\nwild animals can influence climate via emissions of GHGs\n(from anaerobic fermentation of plant materials in the\nrumen), impacts on vegetation (via foraging), changes in fire\nfrequency (as grazers lower grass and vegetation densities\nas potential fuels), and nutrient cycling and transport\n(by adding nutrients to soils). Conserving and restoring\nmegafauna in northern regions also prevents thawing of\npermafrost and reduces woody encroachment, thus avoiding\nmethane emissions and increases in albedo. Defaunation\naffects carbon storage in tropical forests and savannahs. In\nthe tropics, the loss of mega-faunal frugivores is estimated\nbe responsible for up to 10% reduction in carbon storage\nof global tropical forests. Frugivore rewilding programmes in\nthe tropics are seen as carbon sequestration options that can\nbe equally effective as tree planting schemes. Biodiversity\nconservation measures generally favour adaptation,\nbut can interact with food security, land degradation or\ndesertification. Protected areas for biodiversity reduce\nthe land available for food production, and abundancies\nof some species (such as large animals) can influence\nland degradation processes by grazing, trampling\nand compacting soil surfaces, thereby altering surface\ntemperatures and chemical reactions affecting sediment\nand carbon retention.</td>

      <td>Enhanced\nweathering\nof minerals</td>
      <td>The enhanced weathering of minerals that naturally\nabsorb CO2 from the atmosphere has been proposed\nas a CDR technology with a large mitigation potential.\nThe rocks are ground to increase the surface area and\nthe ground minerals are then applied to the land where\nthey absorb atmospheric CO2.</td>
      <td>Enhanced mineral weathering can remove atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide (CO2). Since ground minerals can increase pH,\nthere could be some benefits for efforts to prevent or reverse\nland degradation where acidification is the driver of degrada-\ntion. Since increasing soil pH in acidified soils can increase\nproductivity, the same effect could provide some benefit for\nfood security. Minerals used for enhanced weathering need\nto be mined, and mining has large impacts locally, though the\ntotal area mined is likely to be small on the global scale.</td>

      <td>Bioenergy and\nbioenergy with\ncarbon capture\nand storage\n(BECCS)</td>
      <td>Bioenergy production can mitigate climate change\nby delivering an energy service, therefore avoiding\ncombustion of fossil energy. It is the most common\nrenewable energy source used in the world today and\nhas a large potential for future deployment (see Cross-\nChapter Box 7 in this chapter). BECCS entails the use of\nbioenergy technologies (e.g., bioelectricity or biofuels)\nin combination with CO2 capture and storage (see also\nGlossary). BECCS simultaneously provides energy and\ncan reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Chapter 2;\nCross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter) for a discussion\nof potentials and atmospheric effects); thus, BECCS\nis considered a CDR technology. While several BECCS\ndemonstration projects exist, it has yet to be deployed\nat scale. Bioenergy and BECCS are widely-used in many\nfuture scenarios as a climate change mitigation option\nin the energy and transport sector, especially those\nscenarios aimed at a stabilisation of global climate\nat 2&#176;C or less above pre-industrial levels.</td>
      <td>Bioenergy and BECCS can compete for land and water with\nother uses. Increased use of bioenergy and BECCS can result\nin large expansion of cropland area, significant deforestation,\nand increased irrigation water use and water scarcity. Large-\nscale use of bioenergy can result in increased food prices and\ncan lead to an increase in the population at risk of hunger.\nAs a result of these effects, large-scale bioenergy and BECCS\ncan have negative impacts for food security. Interlinkages\nof bioenergy and BECCS with climate change adaptation,\nland degradation, desertification, and biodiversity are highly\ndependent on local factors such as the type of energy crop,\nmanagement practice, and previous land use. For example,\nintensive agricultural practices aiming to achieve high crop\nyields, as is the case for some bioenergy systems, may have\nsignificant effects on soil health, including depletion of\nsoil organic matter, resulting in negative impacts on land\ndegradation and desertification. However, with low inputs\nof fossil fuels and chemicals, limited irrigation, heat/drought\ntolerant species, using marginal land, biofuel programmes\ncan be beneficial to future adaptation of ecosystems.</td>
