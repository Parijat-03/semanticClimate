We synthesize the findings of this literature using three lenses: existing company engagement with SBTs, appraisal of SBT methods and governance, and the prospects of SBT diffusion and interactions with policy. We then conclude with the implications of current findings and knowledge gaps for actors developing methods and guidance for setting SBTs, policymakers, and future research.</p>
