Another related framework is used to evaluate the impact land conditions have on a&#160;climate phenomenon in a&#160;pair of experiments with one simulation serving as control run, and a&#160;perturbed simulation with prescribed land conditions (i.e., soil moisture, leaf area index, or surface albedo) characterizing a&#160;specific state of the land surface (i.e., afforestation or deforestation). The difference between the perturbed and control simulations enables a&#160;robust assessment of the possible impact of land conditions on events like droughts and heatwaves (Seneviratne et&#160;al., 2013; Stegehuis et&#160;al., 2015; Hauser et&#160;al., 2016, 2017; van den Hurk et&#160;al., 2016; Vogel et&#160;al., 2017; Rasmijn et&#160;al., 2018; Strandberg and Kjellstr&#246;m, 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.7" top="486.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="486.6" x1="304.7" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.62; y0: 486.6; y1: 496.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">RCM sensitivity simulations have been used in a&#160;similar way to assess the contribution of external forcings and large-scale drivers to projected regional climate change (Nabat et&#160;al., 2014; Brogli et&#160;al., 2019a, b) and the influence of selected drivers on observed extreme events (Meredith et&#160;al., 2015b; J.

A&#160;considerable fraction of CMIP5 and CMIP6 resources has been invested in generating an ensemble of centennial or multi-centennial control simulations with constant external forcings (Pedro et&#160;al., 2016; Rackow et&#160;al., 2018). As part of the CMIP6 DECK (Eyring et&#160;al., 2016a) pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations have been conducted (Menary et&#160;al., 2018). Similarly, control simulations with present-day conditions (pdControl) have been performed to represent internal variability under more recent forcing conditions (Pedro et&#160;al., 2016; Williams et&#160;al., 2018). Control simulations have been used to study the role of internal variability, teleconnections and many other fundamental aspects of climate models (Z. Wang et&#160;al., 2015; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016). Control simulations are also used along with large ensembles of historical or scenario simulations to assess the characteristics of the regional internal climate variability (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="282.28" top="114.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="114.48" x1="282.28" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.3.2.5 Simulations for Evaluating Downscaling Methods</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="90.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="90.6" x1="304.77" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.09; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Experiments driven by quasi-perfect boundary conditions or predictors (observations or reanalysis) can be useful to evaluate downscaling performance (Frei et&#160;al., 2003; Laprise et&#160;al., 2013), including the simulation of observed past trends (Lorenz and Jacob, 2010; </span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.29" top="714.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="714.6" x1="563.29" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.77; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">2019; Bozkurt et&#160;al., 2020) and the added value of downscaling compared to the reanalysis fields (Section&#160;10.3.3.2). Although the reanalysis model itself can introduce biases especially for non-assimilated variables (such as precipitation) it is assumed that in such a&#160;setting, discrepancies between the modelled and observed climate arise mostly from errors in the downscaling method (Laprise et&#160;al., 2013) or internal climate variability generated by the downscaling method (B&#246;hnisch et&#160;al., 2020; Ehmele et&#160;al., 2020). Since AR5, reanalysis-driven RCMs have been extensively evaluated for many regions, especially in the CORDEX framework (see&#160;region specific examples in the Atlas).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="582.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="582.6" x1="563.28" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Over Europe, the VALUE initiative assessed statistical downscaling for marginal, temporal, and spatial aspects of temperature and precipitation including extremes, and performed a&#160;process-based evaluation of specific climatic phenomena (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2019; Maraun et&#160;al., 2019a). Alternatively, statistical downscaling can be evaluated in so-called perfect model or pseudo-reality simulations (Charles et&#160;al., 1999), where a&#160;high-resolution climate model simulation is used as a&#160;proxy for a&#160;hypothetical present and future realities.

Users demand regional climate projections for decision-making and have high expectations regarding accuracy and resolution (R&#246;ssler et&#160;al., 2019a), but some scientists consider such projections still a&#160;matter of basic research (Hewitson et al., 2014a). For instance, large-scale circulation biases or the misrepresentation of regional topography as well as regional phenomena and feedbacks are very relevant (Hall, 2014; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). New global model ensembles such as CMIP6 (Eyring et&#160;al., 2016a), HighResMIP (Haarsma et&#160;al., 2016) or, at the regional scale, the convection permitting simulations from the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) on convective phenomena (Coppola et&#160;al., 2020) have the potential to substantially improve the basis for generating regional climate information, yet uncertainties and (often unresolved) contradictions between model projections at the regional scale can be substantial (Fern&#225;ndez et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="78.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="78.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.26; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Figure&#160;10.6 shows the mean summer temperature and precipitation biases of several state-of-the-art climate model ensembles for the western Mediterranean.
