Universal access to primary health care, including mental health, increased investments in health systems strengthening, and climate-resilient health systems, is one of the means to increase the climate resilience of populations and ensure adaptation [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, stronger commitment and implementation of vector control management approaches, disease surveillance, early warning systems, and equitable vaccine production and distribution can enhance prevention and preparedness to future vector-borne diseases, also drawing from the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The recent IPCC report finds that the co-benefits to health and well-being, such as avoided number of hospitalizations, morbidity, and premature deaths, exceed the financial costs of mitigation measures [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To exemplify, reducing air pollution from the transport sector contributes to climate mitigation and improves air quality, therefore reducing the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution worldwide (a number that is estimated to be around 7 million yearly) [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The IPCC estimates that the financial returns in terms of health benefits of improved air quality are greater than the costs of reaching the Paris Agreement goals [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This also connects with justice and equity, as in many parts of the world, poor and marginalized communities are more affected by air pollution [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The health community is therefore increasingly pushing for governments to account for these health benefits of climate action, as this can lead to more incentives for just, ambitious, and cost-effective climate action [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-19-04840" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
