Air quality in classrooms is often shaped by the selection of masonry materials. Simply put, roofs and wall systems are critical in controlling CO<sub>2</sub> circulation in enclosed spaces, such as classrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Even in the dead of summer, a classroom constructed with cast concrete, concrete block, or brick could hold cool air inside for longer periods in light of their thermal mass-energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In any event, many public schools across the country are constructed out of corrugated iron roofs, remodeled shipping vessels, or asbestos sheeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These non-brick classrooms are characterized by higher indoor concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> as they provide a less spacious passageway for airflow. As summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, stale and stagnant air increases the risk of heat exhaustion and dizziness among students. As many of these educational institutions lack air conditions and a similar cooling system, one may argue that climate change might entrench and exacerbate existing poverty, as there could be poor performance in these schools. As an illustration, young learners in Johannesburg (comparatively mild climate zone) lamented fatigue, nausea, and dizziness when temperatures in the containers peaked beyond 47&#160;&#176;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Put a little differently, climate change might perpetuate inequality as extreme heat in overcrowded spaces impacts the academic performance of pupils from poor schools.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Graphic impact of climate change</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Demography</th><th align="left">Possible impact</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Asthmatics</td><td align="left">Respiratory failure</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Young men</td><td align="left">Increased aggressive behavior</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Students</td><td align="left">Poor educational performance</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Schools</td><td align="left">Water insecurity</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Youth working outdoor</td><td align="left">Heat stress</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Students in public schools</td><td align="left">Dizziness and heat exhaustion</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Asthmatics</td><td align="left">Respiratory failure</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
