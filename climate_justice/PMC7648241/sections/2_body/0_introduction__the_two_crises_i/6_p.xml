The two crises are a true testament to the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch of our own making (Crutzen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). The pandemic can provide an unfortunate yet rare opportunity to take more seriously the concept of health in environmental sustainability research. A focus on health and well-being in the sustainability challenges helps us to pay judicious attention to human society and inequalities within it rather than the natural environment. The fundamental ethical challenge is, however, to create a shared sense of responsibility for protecting the health of &#8220;unknown others&#8221; through empathy.</p>
