In both the ESCR and Amazon cases, the more affluent and white groups purported to speak for the entire relevant community. In the case of the ESCR, older activists in market housing claimed to speak for the entire LES, and claimed that it was in the interests of the entire community to reject the plan. If people disagreed and supported the plan, like public housing representatives did, these people had been manipulated by the city, at least in the eyes of activists. Similarly, in the Amazon HQ case, progressive city residents, typically more affluent white residents of Manhattan and Brooklyn, claimed to speak for the entire city&#8217;s residents. In their eyes, all New Yorkers would suffer in the long term if Amazon&#8217;s HQ settled in Queens, and if anyone disagreed, it was because they had been manipulated by Amazon&#8217;s promises of jobs and economic growth in the city. In both the ESCR and Amazon HQ2 cases, progressive residents failed to acknowledge a genuine difference of interests, and assumed that if public housing residents disagreed with them, it was because they were being manipulated by outside forces. As a result, a rift emerged in both cases between groups who might otherwise have been on the same side of the issue. More affluent and white New Yorkers, as well as public housing residents, both claimed to value climate change planning and equitable economic development. Thus the creation of rifts obscured opportunities to build broader movement coalitions to pursue these common goals.</p>
