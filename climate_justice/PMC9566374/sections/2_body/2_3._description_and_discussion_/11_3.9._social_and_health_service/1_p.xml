<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Extreme climate phenomena produced by climate change can directly affect social and health services and consequently influence people&#8217;s vulnerability and health. Thus, they can hamper access, alter their infrastructure, and cause problems for their functioning. For example, events such as storms, heavy rainfall, and floods can disrupt transport, damage buildings (such as hospitals), interrupt services due to supply cuts, and delay emergency responses.</p>
