<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0020">In the following, we categorize the reviewed literature and identify how the interplay between co-production, adaptation, and SDGs is approached. We start by clarifying the co-production concept, followed by a categorization of the research focus in the reviewed corpus. We highlight and discuss three topics based on the review: 1) the methods employed in co-production, how they localize SDG targets for adaptation and resolve synergies and tradeoffs; 2) how power asymmetries emerge through the processes of co-production; and 3) whether and how the SDG agenda contributes to a shift in the role of researchers towards a role as &#8220;informed agitators&#8221; conducting interventionist approaches for adaptation.</p>
