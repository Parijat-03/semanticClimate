Afraid of potential retaliations against agricultural exports due to the extinction of the ministry, the &#8216;ruralistas&#8217; convinced Bolsonaro to keep it, even if with less management capacities and a smaller budget. In the current organizational framework of the Ministry of Environment, climate change has become a bargaining tool between Brazil&#8217;s federal government and international cooperation actors, including the EU and European countries such as Germany and Norway.</p>
