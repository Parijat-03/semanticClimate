In fact, the latter allows only for direct inter-level relations (Simon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>). As opposed to this formal hierarchy of ND systems, i.e., box-in-box-in-box systems, the scheme in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> possesses main features of a heterarchy type models (McCulloch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1945</xref>), also used as models for corporate management in sustainability, such as the Viable System Model (Beer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1959</xref>; see also Espinosa and Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>, pp. 8&#8211;14). The heterarchy approach to normativity as a cross-scale, cross-level process &#8220;can play an important role in engendering shared understanding of different and similar perspectives on how transitions to sustainability may take place&#8221; (Peter and Swilling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>, p. 1616).</p>
