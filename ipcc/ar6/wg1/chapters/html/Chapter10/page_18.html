This linkage was also the topic of Box&#160;3.2 of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a&#160;Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b). It is a&#160;topic that has been strongly debated (Ogawa et&#160;al., 2018; K. Wang et&#160;al., 2018). Separate hypotheses have emerged for winter and summer that describe possible mechanisms of how the Arctic can influence the weather and climate at lower latitudes. They involve changes in the polar vortex, storm tracks, jet stream, planetary waves, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and eddy-mean flow interactions, thereby affecting the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, and the frequency, intensity, duration, seasonality and spatial extent of extremes and climatic impact-drivers like cold spells, heatwaves, and floods (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.1, Figure&#160;1). However, we note that a&#160;decrease in the intensity of cold extremes has been observed in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in winter since 1950 (Section&#160;11.3.2; van Oldenborgh et&#160;al., 2019). Since SROCC, new literature has appeared, and the mechanisms and their criticisms are assessed here as an update and extension to the SROCC box.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="260.41" top="558.48"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 73.06; y0: 558.48; y1: 568.48; width: 8.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="558.48" x1="260.41">Mechanisms for a&#160;potential influence in winter</span><span x0="64.91" y0="546.6" x1="543.18" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 546.6; y1: 556.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">It has been proposed that Arctic amplification, by reducing the equator&#8211;pole temperature contrast, could result in a&#160;weaker and more meandering jet with Rossby waves of larger amplitude (Francis et&#160;al., 2017; Zhang and Luo, 2020). This may cause weather systems to travel eastward more slowly and thus, all other things being equal, Arctic amplification could lead to more persistent weather patterns over the mid-latitudes (Francis and Vavrus, 2012). The persistent large meandering flow may increase the likelihood of connected patterns of temperature and precipitation climatic impact-drivers because they frequently occur when atmospheric circulation patterns are persistent, which tends to occur with a&#160;strong meridional wind component. Another possible consequence of Arctic warming is on the NAO/AO that shows a&#160;negative trend over the 1990s and early 2000s (Robson et&#160;al., 2016; Iles and Hegerl, 2017), and has been linked to the reduction of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, and the increase in Eurasian snow cover (Cohen et&#160;al., 2012; Nakamura et&#160;al., 2015; Yang et&#160;al., 2016). During negative NAO/AO the storm tracks shift equatorward and winters are predominantly more severe across northern Eurasia and the eastern United States, but relatively mild in the Arctic. This temperature pattern is sometimes referred to as the &#8216;warm Arctic&#8211;cold continents (WACC)&#8217; pattern (Chen et&#160;al., 2018). However, L. Sun et&#160;al. (2016) noticed that the WACC is a&#160;manifestation of natural variability. Enhanced sea ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea has also been related to a&#160;weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex (Kretschmer et&#160;al., 2020) and its increased variability (Kretschmer et&#160;al., 2016) that would induce a&#160;negative NAO/AO (Kim et&#160;al., 2014), the WACC pattern (Kim et&#160;al., 2014), and an increase in cold air outbreaks (CAO) in mid-latitudes (Kretschmer et&#160;al., 2018). Arctic warming might also increase Eurasian snow cover in autumn caused by the moister air that is advected into Eurasia from the Arctic with reduced sea ice cover (Cohen et&#160;al., 2014; Jaiser et&#160;al., 2016), although Peings (2019) suggests a&#160;possible influence of Ural blockings on both the autumn snow cover and the early winter polar stratosphere. The circulation changes over the Ural-Siberian region are also suggested to provide a&#160;link between Barents-Kara sea ice and the NAO (Santolaria-Ot&#237;n et&#160;al., 2021).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="266.51" top="306.48"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 73.06; y0: 306.48; y1: 316.48; width: 8.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="306.48" x1="266.51">Mechanisms for a&#160;potential influence in summer</span><span x0="64.91" y0="294.6" x1="543.2" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 70.37; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As in winter, Arctic summer warming may result in a&#160;weakening of the westerly jet and mid-latitude storm tracks, as suggested for the recent period of Arctic warming (Coumou et&#160;al., 2015; Petrie et&#160;al., 2015; Chang et&#160;al., 2016). Additional proposed consequences are a&#160;southward shift of the jet (Butler et&#160;al., 2010) and a&#160;double jet structure associated with an increase of the land&#8211;ocean thermal gradient at the coastal boundary (Coumou et&#160;al., 2018). It is hypothesized that weaker jets, diminished meridional temperature contrast, and reduced baroclinicity might induce a&#160;larger amplitude in stationary wave response to stationary forcings (Zappa et&#160;al., 2011; Petoukhov et&#160;al., 2013; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015; Coumou et&#160;al., 2018; Mann et&#160;al., 2018; R. Zhang et&#160;al., 2020), and also that a&#160;double jet structure would favour wave resonance (Kornhuber et&#160;al., 2017; Mann et&#160;al., 2017). Some studies suggest that this is corroborated by an observed increase of quasi-stationary waves (Di Capua and Coumou, 2016; Vavrus et&#160;al., 2017; Coumou&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2018).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="113.79" top="174.48"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 71.02; y0: 174.48; y1: 184.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: XUSUUO+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="64.91" y0="174.48" x1="113.79">Assessment</span><span x0="64.91" y0="162.6" x1="543.09" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The above proposed hypotheses are based on concepts of geophysical fluid dynamics and surface coupling and can, in principle, help explain the existence of a&#160;link between the Arctic changes and the mid-latitudes with the potential to affect many impact sectors (Barnes and Screen, 2015). However, the validity of some dynamical underlying mechanisms, such as a&#160;reduced meridional temperature contrast inducing enhanced wave amplitude, has been questioned (Hassanzadeh et&#160;al., 2014; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015). On the contrary, the reduced meridional temperature contrast has been related to reduced meridional temperature advection and thereby reduced winter temperature variability (Collow et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="543.19" top="78.6"><span x0="64.91" y0="78.6" x1="543.19" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Studies that support the Arctic influence are mostly based on observational relationships between the Arctic temperature or sea ice extent and mid-latitude anomalies or extremes (Cohen et&#160;al., 2012; Francis and Vavrus, 2012, 2015; Budikova et&#160;al., 2017).
