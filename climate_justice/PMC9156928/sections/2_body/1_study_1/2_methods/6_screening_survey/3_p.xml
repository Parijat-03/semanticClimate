To limit this possibility, we ensured people had no history of activism. Being engaged in activism outside our study would have made it more likely for a participant to attend an activist event that we could not track during the study. Therefore, we asked everyone at recruitment if they had ever attended an event organized by an environmental organization (such as a protest). Those answering yes were then asked how many times they attended such an event (once, more than once). 15 participants responding &#8216;more than once&#8217; were excluded from the study.</p>
