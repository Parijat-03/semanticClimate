<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0075">Participation is a prerequisite for the co-production of knowledge and an important consideration in the discourses and practices of policy development. Although there were gaps in understanding of how participation should be conceptualized in policy-making processes for adaptation under the implementation of the MDGs, significant strides were made to increase local and female participation (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Collins and Ison, 2009</xref>). The transition to the SDGs compounded the differing global and local objectives to economic development, environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and for nations to commit to &#8220;good governance&#8221; (<xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Sachs, 2012</xref>). The SDGs come with 173 targets and 232 indicators for measuring progress for the different subgoals. To adjust and adapt the indicators and targets to national, regional, and local contexts, the localizing process necessary for subnational implementation of SDGs clearly entail processes of stakeholder participation and co-production (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">GTLRG, 2016</xref>). Resolving tradeoffs between SDG goals represents a &#8220;critical step&#8221; in localizing the SDGs, and potential conflicts should be assessed in relation to implementation (<xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Valencia et al., 2019</xref>). A key to mitigating tradeoffs between SDGs is to create partnerships with a diverse set of stakeholders in the localizing process (<xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Valencia et al., 2019</xref>). This review shows that such processes are taking place in relation to adaptation. For instance, researcher-stakeholder collaborations can be an efficient measure for resolving land use challenges and adopting SDG targets tied to biodiversity, adaptation, and mitigation (Reed et al. 2019). Co-production of knowledge also serve to reconcile tradeoffs and secure consensus between stakeholders (Reed et al., 2019). While comprehensive stakeholder involvement might mitigate tradeoffs and reduce goal conflicts, such processes are also time-consuming and drain resources. A large study of SDG implementation found that efforts to resolve tradeoffs took so much time and effort that it reduced the overall performance in achieving individual SDGs (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Glass and Newig, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, good performance on participatory processes was related to a high degree of SDG achievements (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Glass and Newig, 2019</xref>). <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Orchard and colleagues (2019)</xref>, drawing on interventionist case studies in the Indian Himalayas, found that building an adaptive capacity to climate change requires that synergies between SDG goals 13, 1, 2, 5, and 15 be utilized. One example combined flood prevention and forest restoration projects, which comes with several co-benefits tied to biodiversity, enhanced crop yields, and increased livelihood diversification developed in collaborative, participatory partnerships (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Orchards et al., 2019</xref>). To conclude, it appears that processes for resolving synergies and tradeoffs between SDG targets tied to adaptation and other SDGs and targets do utilize participatory approaches, but these are not always researcher-stakeholder partnerships engaging in the co-production of knowledge.</p>
