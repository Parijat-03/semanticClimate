Such ecologically integrating landscape units are known as Green Circuits. A Report on Green Circuit is being finalized and will be submitted to DDA for implementation. This will act as protective shield against desertification, and mitigate and adaptive to climate change. </span><span x0="90.02" y0="591.84" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 591.84; y1: 603.84; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="591.84" x1="526.21" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 116.68; y0: 591.84; y1: 603.84; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Greenways with 3-tier vegetation all along 52 km stretch of Yamuna river front will be undertaken, to enhance the green cover that buffer temperature and ameliorate environment. </span><span x0="90.02" y0="543.36" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 543.36; y1: 555.36; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="543.36" x1="526.27" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 114.69; y0: 543.36; y1: 555.36; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Floodplain forests and its wetlands will be restored to regulate floods and enhance availability of water resources. </span></div><div left="90.02" right="95.54" top="510.72"><span x0="90.02" y0="510.72" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 510.72; y1: 522.72; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="510.72" x1="526.05" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 116.02; y0: 510.72; y1: 522.72; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Restoration and biodiversity enrichment of Ridge protected forests, city forests and woodlands and urban parks will be carried out to ensure that the urban ecosystem will be resilient to climate change. </span><span x0="90.02" y0="462.36" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 462.36; y1: 474.36; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="462.36" x1="526.03" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 118.69; y0: 462.36; y1: 474.36; width: 10.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">More degraded areas will be brought under Biodiversity Parks for enhancing climate resilience of urban ecosystems. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.13" top="420.58"><span x0="72.02" y0="420.58" x1="526.13" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 420.58; y1: 432.58; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Short term strategies include Protection of existing notified forest from encroachment; Increased Green cover; Involvement of Civic Agencies for enhancement of tree cover; free distribution of seedlings to public for planting; Involvement of all stake holders in raising awareness; Eradication of invasive species of weeds.

The effect of these impacts is amplified due to the rapid increase in high range of population size and resource utilization in the city of Delhi. Utility services like water resources and energy would be most affected by local and global climate change, due to the high dependence of the population on these resources and the scarcity that follows. The government should therefore take planned measures for demand and supply side management of resources. This is in addition to planned increases in adaptive capacity and development of technological and institutional infrastructure to better deal with the impacts of climate change. </span></div></body></html>
