As Beck and Mahony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>) argue, the technical elaboration of possible future pathways is an inseparable part of the &#8216;politics of anticipation&#8217;&#8212;bringing certain futures into a political reality. IPCC scenarios such as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) do not just represent possible states of the future but also emerge as discursive objects that can determine political actions in the present. These scenarios were created primarily as scientific heuristics for evaluating climate impacts and mitigation costs, but they also became political devices for justifying certain policy options (Hausfather and Peters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Pielke and Ritchie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>).</p>
