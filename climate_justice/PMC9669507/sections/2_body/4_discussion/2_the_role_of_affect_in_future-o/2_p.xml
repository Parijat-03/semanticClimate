the models as a feedback system that stimulates retrospective appraisal of
previous actions, and possibly alters future behavior (<xref rid="bibr3-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Baumeister et al., 2007</xref>). For example,
if someone is fearful due to interpreting the model, this emotion can stimulate
the thought of previous actions that should have been taken and possibly inform
future behavior. In light of this, it might be worth exploring whether public
emotionality mediates the possible effect of predictive journalism on informing
readers&#8217; judgments and decisions or motivating their actions with respect to the
future. Given that affect can drive planning and eventual action (<xref rid="bibr37-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Seligman et al.,
2016</xref>), it seems crucial that future work engage deeply with the affective
response to predictive journalism. This is aligned with the recently termed
&#8220;emotional turn&#8221; in journalism studies&#8212;a growing area of research in journalism
in the past decade that recognizes the importance of emotion as a prism to
understand social and political life which suggests an agenda for research on
how emotions and journalism intersect (<xref rid="bibr43-14614448221135632" ref-type="bibr">Wahl-Jorgensen and Pantti, 2021</xref>).</p>
