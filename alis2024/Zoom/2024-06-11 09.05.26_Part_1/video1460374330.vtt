00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.849
Oh, view full transcript, right, that's fine. That's what we want. Good.

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:27.549
Okay.

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:42.299
I still haven't got around to figuring out what the distance between transcript and closed captions is Because Zoom.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.300
No, I.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:59.049
Okay. My impression is that Zoom produces 3 things which are actually all the same. One of them Some of them have got the speaker identification on and some don't.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.799
So I think there's a lot of redundancy there.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Right. Okay, well.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:21.199
6Â min past, let's get going. Smitch is not coming. Who else might come?

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.099
Do you think Renew?

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:28.366
Yeah, that's, that will also not come because she's also not well. Maybe I know.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.549
Good morning. That

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.599
Sorry, who was the second one?

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.899
Right, okay, fine, okay. And I sent you.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:46.599
And more, about Unmo, I don't have any information, so may. Yeah.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:55.599
Right. It's very important that these people who have volunteered at or who are interns are regular at this stage.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:02:01.499
Not so much the volunteers but the interns. Is An Mullen in turn.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.999
Yes.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:09.349
Well, and, would be telling us if he's going to attend or not going to attend, all right?

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.749
We will remind him again.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:22.849
Yes, indeed. And also, in turn should be filling out. A daily sheet of What they did, what they're going to do and what's blocking them.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.549
And they should be doing a weekly report, right?

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:26.598
Hmm.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.699
Yes.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:41.799
And I know it's, hard to, you know, to get discipline, but this is what makes the difference between acceptable and good, right?

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.099
Okay.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.450
And if we don't get this regular structure, it makes life a lot more difficult for Renault.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.499
Hmm.

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.149
Okay.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.199
Yes, Peter.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:05.249
A quick question. And Do you know what, Gita's movements are? Is she away from an IPGR?

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.450
Cheese and then IT there and she comes through the and I think about But the time is not fixed, so.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.350
No, no, also she's back because she went, she went on travels, didn't she?

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.849
She come and go on label.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.199
No. This is still in.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Hi, I thought she went to I thought she went to Bangalore.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.549
Not, not, because today she is here.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:36.849
Oh, okay. I clearly got it wrong. Right. Okay, well that's absolutely fine.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Hmm.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:41.499
Good. Okay.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So let's start. the other thing is, that, Hello, Parjat, if you are listening you know take time to get well as as well.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:11.350
I'm sorry people are Shake. Right. So right.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The good news was that. Polly, who is a volunteer, in Cambridge has read the transcripts, Polly doesn't have any.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:30.549
Computing background and she understands and transcripts. And she can also run the Python.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:43.600
So she's a very, very good test of whether our level of discourse is good enough for, What I will call,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:55.650
Keen volunteers who don't have a background in semantics in collaboration and things like that.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:09.150
So she and Kay are very good touchstone here. And if you have people in India who also want to be in the same room, role as reading what we've done, that would be great.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.250
Okay, any problems?

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:26.299
No problems, okay. We're now

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:27.348
Not any as of now.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.199
Right. Well, you think you'll have some in the future.

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:38.149
No, I don't. I didn't mean to imply that.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:46.366
No, that's fine. Don't worry. And people can always make problems. But that's Not always useful.

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:54.299
No, that's very good. So we are working on the basis that Amy Lib works.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.800
At Amy climate. Probably works except for. Downloading.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:27.200
Some of the IPCC material. And, so one of the tasks that I have and it'll have to wait until the end of the I, the, the, the, the, article is to come up with a complete semantic, conversion of all the IPCC chapters.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:43.450
And I don't know what's up with the headless browser, but it's this is a good example of prioritization right we have an immediate task which is deadlines which is this article.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:56.449
We have, we're in development phase so we can have a workaround where we don't all have to be able to run the software for production work because we can share the output.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:09.400
And so forth. Okay. I am now going to take a deep breath and for the next hour, go through what we're going to have in this article.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:18.900
And even if it runs over an hour, I suggest we don't stop. Renew if I'm still managing to keep ahead.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:20.649
Okay.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.950
Okay.

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.099
So this is a monologue. Well.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:35.399
Thank also that's the for you. I wanted to ask you if you're going ahead and with the flyer.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:38.399
I think that was saying we have to work on.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:58.700
I would say that's lower priority. So again, we prioritize things. And it was, it took a year for, this person, whose name I forget to come back from, Knowledge Futures.

00:07:54.799 --> 00:08:06.799
So, A few days in doing this is not going to. Cause her problems and so on.

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:13.149
So when we manage things, we're always thinking about what's its priority? Are there any deadlines?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:27.700
Do other parts of the program depend on it? It will be very valuable to have a flyer, but we don't have time in the next 2 or 3 days because we're focused on this article.

00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:35.249
Okay, right. Anything else before I get going?

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:50.299
Okay. So. This is how I see the, article and I want you to I want you to sync as we go along.

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:54.649
What do you understand? What do you not understand? And it would be a good idea to put this.

00:08:53.349 --> 00:09:01.349
In the chat as we go along, in other words, I didn't understand something.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:11.550
And also, and this is a difficult part at the end to think what did we not put in this discourse here.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:18.050
Right. Okay. So. I take a bit of T.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:30.900
Off we are. So. This article, is to celebrate the centenary of SR.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Ranganathon, the father of library science. And, It is complex and ambitious.

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:56.199
And there are many seems to it. So we will indicate these as we go through. The 1st and probably the most important thing for library science is, is that, it describes semantic publication.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000
An idea which has been around for, probably 50 years. Promoted in.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:17.200
1994 by Tim Berners Lee, particularly, but almost completely ignored by the. Scholarly, publishing communicate.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:30.449
Community. We believe. Passionately that scholarly publishing must become semantic if it is not to be totally overcome by new methods.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:45.250
Which have been developed, often labeled AI and so on. So. This will outline the structure and purpose of semantic publication.

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:55.049
To do it. And to exemplify it, we'll be talking about climate. Climate is the most important thing.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:17.600
In the world at the moment even though in many elections it's not mentioned If one follows the climate discourse, then, very serious predictions about How the world is going to change almost all for the worse.

00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:27.249
And how we have to adapt and how we have to mitigate. And those are going to happen whether or not politicians do anything.

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:37.649
Immediate about it. We are lucky that we have. Very good material to work with in climate.

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:44.299
And it's an ideal starting point to show what semantics are.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:58.300
So. The structure of this article is going to be partially semantic. The ideal would be to make the whole article semantic.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:12.300
It would be probably the equivalent of 500 published pages including a multimedia of various sorts because that's what semantic is doing at the moment.

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:21.299
However, we have to condense it into something readable. So there will be a narrative in HTML.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:36.699
And very possibly from this monologue at the moment, which will cover all the main points. And the monologue will then be hyperlinked into richer semantic components.

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:45.899
As we go. So the monologue will probably be about, 2030 pages when printed.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:58.367
And then, that monologue will be conversed into. Converted into a PDF or publication in the NS article.

00:12:57.149 --> 00:13:15.149
And our intention is that that will be a high level guide to what we're doing. But heavily hyperlinked so that people can get an immediate idea of what the particular component, what the political particular philosophy is.

00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:38.749
At any stage. So we'll start with semantic publishing. I am sure we are sure that if Ranganison were working today that he would be hyperactive on making publishing a semantic.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:52.400
He worked in a time when the flow of information was very slow and was primarily from author to reader by a printed material.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:14:09.850
And picking out the important concepts for today. We have inclusiveness. That he was passionate about including people outside the traditional, library readership.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:18.449
And in our case, this is outside. Traditional scholarly publishing. So he mentioned.

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:35.199
The, infirm, people with language disabilities. And people who did not have access to to books and so on.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:43.100
And I'm sure that he would be promoting all of these. Ideas very actively.

00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:57.101
Among his laws we will pick out. Save the time of the reader. And that is very much the seam of this article here.

00:14:56.851 --> 00:15:15.851
We are making. Articles easier to read and we will add to that, save the time of the author, because authors are many readers are now also authors.

00:15:09.901 --> 00:15:24.901
In, the multi-dimensional web, you can offer at many levels, primary also you can comment on others and so on.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:34.250
And I am sure that he would have been and active in this. he would have been I think very.

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:44.701
Disappointed with PDF as the main medium of scholarly communication. He promoted semantic publishing.

00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:57.351
And in library classifications. With the Klong classification, which is a forerunner of today's No SQL databases.

00:15:54.401 --> 00:16:15.401
Many of which work on a faceted approach to, classification and discovery. And I am sure that he would have seen data and text as simply parts of a spectrum.

00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:26.701
Rather than 2 separate components which we have at the moment where you publish the text, you publish the data and then you make some weak hyperlink between them.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:36.750
Data and text are simply parts of a continuum which which which includes discourse. Multimedia.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:47.950
And much else. Now. We are inspired by the work of Tim Berners Lee.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:55.750
Who, came up with the concept, in about 1990 of the semantic web.

00:16:55.751 --> 00:17:04.751
And, he, Tim really launched this at the 1994, World Wide Web Conference.

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:18.901
Where he gave a vision of the semantic web. Which was an integrated system. Where all information was semantic and where you could

00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:30.701
Where you could discover it and understand it. With, a range of tools.

00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:53.001
Semantic many people adopted this concept of semantic publishing. And built systems and in the early 2,000, s and it was I, there was a considerable level of discourse about it, tools were created, exemplars were created.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:18:04.250
And so David Shotton created a marked up. Archicho, Henry Shepherd and I myself did this for chemistry.

00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:29.001
And there were various prototypes of semantic material. And one of the useful concepts at that stage was Nano-publication, the idea that we could break publications down into small components and each of those was semantic and could be understood by machines.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:40.950
We will see this idea. Later in, the knowledge graph for the, UN IPCC material.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:54.400
The other thing that happened in about the same time was the rise of open. Open is a philosophy of universal access.

00:18:53.651 --> 00:19:07.651
To. Knowledge, both its consumption and its creation. And, There were many efforts to systematize this.

00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:23.551
For example, open, source and free software were championed by Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman.

00:19:22.551 --> 00:19:33.551
And those concepts have been Seminal in changing the way that software is developed in a community.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:43.200
And with, universally available tools for the whole process. Open source.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:20:14.100
Of free and open source software. FOSS has been enormously successful and most software which is generated and outside corporations is FOSS and organizations such as the, European Commission, and, other national bodies have taken on board the requirement to make software an open.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:23.000
What open means is, that a piece of information, is free to use.

00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:34.551
Reuse and redistribute without any permission. And that's encapsulated by the, open knowledge foundations.

00:20:33.801 --> 00:20:49.801
Open definition, which I have just quoted from. It was expected in, the 2,000, s that the idea of open would spread to other.

00:20:49.001 --> 00:21:10.001
Aspects of human knowledge and and in 25 years ago there was a major commitment by the Budapest definition of open access which defines what open access to, published knowledge should be.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:22.201
And it takes the view of the open definition that this is free to use reuse and redistribute without permission.

00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:38.401
And that the purpose of published knowledge is for use by the world as well as for recording what particular people and organisations have done.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:53.500
Unfortunately, that, vision has failed. Open access is now largely in the global north is largely bureaucratic and and a business model.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:22:09.650
Complex and it doesn't serve the ideals of reuse and global ownership. This the model of open however has been.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:18.800
Adopted by the Global South. Particularly, in Latin America, which is also spreading this vision.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:41.050
And, in the work of Ariana Beck and colleagues, a co author on these the model which is practiced is that publishing scholarly publishing is a public Good and should be available to the whole world.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:50.850
And that means that anyone can access it, reuse it, and the reuse can actually be repurposing so that we can.

00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:59.199
We can make this semantic for easier reuse.

00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:15.649
In terms of science. Open science again is a concept which was advocated. It's, not really, It's not universal, it's patchy.

00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:40.849
And one of the adherence to this full open model was, It's the idea of open notebook science, which was championed by Jean Claude Bradley and we adopt the idea of open notebook science where we make everything that we do available immediately to the whole world.

00:23:40.249 --> 00:24:04.249
Now, this is not at the moment. Automatic because the tools do not exist but we are in the process of generating tools which will take the work that we do, including developing this paper, this article, and put it out to the world as we do it.

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:18.599
It builds on the concept of the Memex from Van. In 1948 where he conceived a machine which would record everything you do.

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:39.299
And make this available for posterity. Unfortunately, we are seeing this model developed by closed corporations over which we have no control, very little insight, and which is not done for the benefit of humanity.

00:24:34.001 --> 00:25:00.001
But for the benefit of the corporations and we have to try and create however we can do it an equivalent which is open so that as the world creates knowledge it publishes it immediately in semantic form.

00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:10.501
That's the theme of this article. Now, we're going to use a particular.

00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:22.899
Set of examples to show this and these examples are not hypothetical. We have done them. So we have built semantic knowledge products.

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:30.099
In the area of climate. Climate is the most important thing in the world at the moment.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:45.700
Many people think we have only a few Yes. Until we, enter irretrievable, tipping points, feedback loops, and, human disaster.

00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:56.651
And, So it's immediate. It's technically very complex. It covers every domain.

00:25:50.951 --> 00:26:11.951
So it covers Mathematics, physics, astronomy. Chemistry. Iology, psychology.

00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:34.451
Politics Law every discipline, is involved in climate. Much of the work so far has been global north centric, so, it's written from the point of view of English speaking.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:27:00.250
Nations, and often with, a neo-colonial agenda. But at the center of, the efforts we espouse what the united nations is doing in 3 areas, the creation of records of United Nations meetings.

00:26:57.551 --> 00:27:08.551
That's the UN FCCC. The handbook on climate, the IPCC reports.

00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:18.051
And, the, IPCC glossary, which we are turning into semantic 4.th

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:40.049
It's pan disciplinary as I say, which means that almost always, we will be finding we interact with disciplines which we have not been trained in and have no knowledge and so we have to be able to read and understand those very quickly.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:53.550
The Things that. Semantic climate can help with immediately are the concepts to extract those from the IPCC.

00:27:46.951 --> 00:28:09.951
And the terminology. So. We deal primarily with, Textual and graphical discourse, we're not dealing with data at the moment.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:15.599
That's deliberate. There's a lot of people who work with data. Again, it's complex.

00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:23.251
It's complex to discover. So we're working with, what we're called documents.

00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:31.301
Right, that's setting the scene. I know it's taking a long time, but we will condense all this.

00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:43.151
At the end. So we now come on to the model. Of our publication. So this is semantic publication.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:55.600
And what this involved is a wide range of things, that have to be done before something is semantic.

00:28:55.051 --> 00:29:10.051
So. We'll have a mental model here of a. A document, a scholarly publication or a report from a company or government or NGO.

00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:20.751
And 1st thing we have to do is to structure it. So. What are the components? Of the document.

00:29:17.449 --> 00:29:33.449
A lot has been done. For the bibliography of the document so that's very well researched and supported by, the academic and other communities.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:49.350
Less has been done with the actual content of the document. So conceptually a document, often, has a head, body and footers.

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:57.599
The header, is describing what is in the document, often called metadata.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:06.950
And, that is described in great detail by the, JETS suite. Which.

00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:17.101
Has about 250 terms which describe the components of a scholarly publication.

00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:27.551
It's applicable to other, domains as well. So it covers things like, Publisher, authors.

00:30:26.301 --> 00:30:38.301
Subjects. And abstracts references, things of that sort. The body of a publication is much less well defined.

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:46.001
And varies a great deal. And is often domain, specific.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:56.850
And, the, And then we come to the microstructure of the document where we go down to the individual.

00:30:55.251 --> 00:31:06.251
Nano components. No, no, public thing was developed by, Baron Mons and Jan Valterop.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:21.600
And, and ideally, comes down to statements which are about the size of a sentence. And which can be taken out of context if they're properly annotated.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:38.300
And, the IPCC, Since this report and other reports are actually in many cases a collection of micro, nano publications and very well.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.800
In this. They are.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:57.600
Often sufficiently well stated that they can be taken. Out of context or that if you give them a context they can be understood without the rest of the document.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:23.250
They're not a new idea. They're well seen in analysis of our presentation of religious texts and and works, and creative works, such as collections of plays or, a poetry or whatever.

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:36.099
And I'd welcome examples from Indian culture. And so I may mention things which are in the English and.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:58.200
Christian canon but only because I'm familiar with them and they are very well described in research. So, religious texts, often are represented as, a collection of books.

00:32:58.149 --> 00:33:06.149
The books have chapters. And the chapters have verses. And the verses are micro addressable.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:12.600
So very often, all that is quoted is the verse. And, it's address.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:30.600
Which is normally something like chapter and verse. Now to support this, we have all the elements in HTML and we see HTML and we see HTML as the elements in HTML and we see HTML as the tool which will support.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000
All of our, work except for. Specialist subjects. And HML has a rich.

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:56.299
Range of structuring tools we will use. Head body. I'm within body we will use, which is a division, which can be, either, More divisions or.

00:33:55.699 --> 00:34:08.699
Paragraphs. Or, lists or tables. So those are the main, next micro addressable levels.

00:34:08.049 --> 00:34:17.049
And then we have within a paragraph. We have in line. Mark up, which is spans.

00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:32.368
So a paragraph may consist of a list of spans which is very useful. It may also have A's which are anchors for hyperlinks, bi-directional hyperlinks.

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:41.450
And, Those are what we will represent. Used to represent our semantic.

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:51.349
Material. Now on top of those elements as they're called in XML, we have attributes.

00:34:50.149 --> 00:35:09.149
Which are in the start tag of LMS and and particularly these include classes. So the class attribute gives the role of the Yeah.

00:35:08.749 --> 00:35:25.749
And may also be used to give information on its display. We strictly separate. Content from presentation, which is a major semantic philosophy.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:32.450
So that, There is no presentation information in what we create. But you can present it.

00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:52.801
In different ways by using. by using tools such as cascading style sheets which allow you to discover the class the HTML classes and to render them in different ways, by using, you to discover the class, the HTML classes, and to render them in different ways, which allow you to discover the class, the HTML classes, and to render them in different ways, including hiding

00:35:52.152 --> 00:35:54.152
them, and to render them in different ways, including hiding them, or aggregating them.

00:35:55.369 --> 00:36:10.369
So HTML contains all of the management tools that we need and we would strongly recommend, that, that all publication, was in semantic HTML.

00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:21.001
Now, we've talked about semantics a lot. Semantics at this level as 2 levels.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:33.250
One is the role of the components. So this is Well, seen in RDF.

00:36:32.451 --> 00:36:42.451
Resource description framework. Which is also, developed to be compatible with HTML.

00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:52.501
So, we promote the idea of, RDF as the vehicle in which roles will be embedded.

00:36:52.651 --> 00:37:07.651
A typical role is Reno Kamari is the author of this article. Peter marry rust is an author of this article.

00:37:07.401 --> 00:37:20.401
Reno Kumari is employed by an IPTR. Peacher Murray Rust is A member of staff in Cambridge University.

00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:32.901
Cambridge University is a university. Cambridge University is located in Cambridge. Cambridge is located in UK.

00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:40.401
By the way, there's more than one Cambridge in the world. An IPGR is located in Delhi.

00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:57.501
An IPGR is a scientific organization. Now those are all stated as triples. Where we have subject, relation object, subject property objects.

00:37:54.101 --> 00:38:07.101
And it's extremely powerful and it's a major tool for how we represent the semantics.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:22.699
However, there's a second dimension to, semantics which is ontologies. Ontologies can become very complex and we use a very lightweight approach to ontologies.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:39.100
So on challenges will allow you to discover the meaning of a relationship, the meaning of an object. And, ontologies are often structured.

00:38:38.551 --> 00:38:52.551
Often with a hierarchy. So We will find that a plant. Has a plant has a binomial name.

00:38:51.699 --> 00:39:01.699
The binomial name. Has a specific and a genus. Again is.

00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:22.951
Is a subset of I forget now, family is it, something of that sort. You can see the hierarchy developing and via scientists use hierarchical classifications a great deal.

00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:33.301
Samantha ontologies are more powerful than that and with tools they can deal with things which have multiple relations.

00:39:28.201 --> 00:39:40.201
And we will see in our dictionary that we have multiple relations within the dictionary.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.650
So that a term, can be related to many other terms.

00:39:46.399 --> 00:40:01.399
Annotation is extremely important. So, Inotation is very well, presented in Wiki Media products, particularly Wiki.

00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:15.001
Wikipedia and terms within the discourse are highlighted as Hiperlinks, normally displayed as blue underlined.

00:40:14.549 --> 00:40:29.549
And so if you have a tool, if you have a term like, and I PGM, it will give you a dynamic hyperlink which links you to.

00:40:28.449 --> 00:40:41.449
The page on the Wikipedia page on an IPGR. And that will in its turn contain a large number of.

00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:58.251
Links, to other concepts and so on. So Wikimedia, contains a literally over a hundred 1 million different concepts, all of which are linkable.

00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:13.101
And where the presentation is usually with inline annotation. A, hyperlinks which are described by an HTML bar A with H for F.

00:41:12.201 --> 00:41:21.201
Which points outward and A with an ID, which, receives incoming annotations.

00:41:22.601 --> 00:41:34.601
The more complex annotation is stand off on an annotation. but this requires software and we don't use standoff on notation at the moment.

00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:46.701
No, knowledge is multimedia. And it should be highly integrated. And,

00:41:46.951 --> 00:41:58.951
Scholarly knowledge consists of text. Images and diagrams. I'll come back to the difference in a minute.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:11.250
Audio and video streams which we shall not deal with in this publication and specialist domains such as maths and chemistry.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:25.750
And all of those are part of, the complete publication and i'm sure ranganison would have been A delighted with the tools available.

00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:34.301
To do that. However, to make that a reality, we need the will to do it and the will to do it.

00:42:34.651 --> 00:42:43.651
Although it was potentially there 15 years ago, there's been virtually no progress in the public domain.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.900
Since then.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.600
So, we now come on to tooling.

00:42:55.951 --> 00:43:07.951
We cannot do, we cannot be completely. Semantic without tools which manage our semantics. And And that's been a major drawback.

00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:16.369
Because without the will, there are no tools and without the tools it's very difficult to create the will.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:26.370
And so what semantic climate is doing is blazing a trail here to try and show that the tools already there.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:35.350
And that what we need primarily is the will to develop them. If we have the will, then we can develop the tools.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:49.350
Now, true semantic and publication will be dynamic. Where, information is always changing. Because the world changes day to day.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:44:04.250
And We, see reports on climate which we want to annotate. We see, comments on previous reports which suggest that they need revision.

00:43:56.902 --> 00:44:11.902
We see new ideas so we would want to reannotate. Those previous works. And so forth.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:20.050
That is hard. It's possible but it's hard. And so we take a static approach at the moment.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:28.450
So all of our, semantic material is essentially static. It's created once.

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:47.599
And it is an archived and available But, it is not dynamically updated. That's not to say, that we don't, ourselves work with dynamic information and we do this using versions.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:57.200
So all of our. Software is heavily versioned. Every time we make a change to the software, we have a new version.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:19.550
And, we believe that that should be the norm for scholarly information. That every time 1st of all that things should be revised they should they should be annotated and each of these should be a new version.

00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:29.199
Tools exist to do it. The will does not. So before we can do this, we need identifiers.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:40.300
Identifies a really important they are things which allow us to refer to a precise object.

00:45:39.399 --> 00:46:02.399
And this really came in, I think, Probably, well, it came in, With Ranganison with his idea of classification you know which Well, he wasn't the 1st to do this.

00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:10.849
But, the idea of classification, and versioning has been with us or.

00:46:11.049 --> 00:46:24.049
Hundreds of years. And But, in terms of versions of applications, Hey, has been very little.

00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:35.751
In terms of dynamic versions and in fact the academic communities idea of the version of record which is what we are publishing here.

00:46:31.368 --> 00:46:50.368
Is highly counterproductive because it suggests that there is a golden period in which one can say this is the state of knowledge at this time and for often for the future.

00:46:48.949 --> 00:47:04.949
That might work for say a mathematical proof. But it does not work for scientific information. It does not work for global information which literally changes by the minute.

00:47:04.099 --> 00:47:17.099
So we But use identifiers for all our material and these identifiers are both semantic and non-smantic.

00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:29.849
A semantic identifier is one whose structure of the string of the identifier explains. What it is and often how to find it.

00:47:28.049 --> 00:47:39.049
So typical semantic identifier which we use in the IPCC reports is report.

00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:47.649
Chapter. Section, subsection, subsection.

00:47:49.001 --> 00:48:05.001
Paragraph sentence. So that's Can all be combined into a single identifier. And that identifier should be permanent for static information.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:11.251
The.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:26.950
Right. I'll now move on to, where we get our material. Now, because there is no semantic publication, we have to convert it from what's called legacy information.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:36.700
And legacy is horrible. So, legacy means it is not semantic. It's often not structured.

00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:51.901
It is very difficult for machines to understand automatically. And it's often impendable to people who do not speak the language in which it's written and who are not experts in the discipline.

00:48:47.449 --> 00:48:54.449
In which it's written.

00:48:54.399 --> 00:49:04.399
There is a hierarchy of, legacy, the lowest, is

00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:12.201
Publications as bit maps. the worst is handwriting. We don't deal with that.

00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:28.799
Then, there is, Type set material, which is sometimes recoverable by optical character recognition, And, if it is clear.

00:49:28.201 --> 00:49:41.201
And if it has come from, if the text has come from a machine is often recoverable. and links to what we do for PDF.

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:53.799
Now most scholarly publications including this article are in PDF. PDF, is extremely difficult to, make semantic.

00:49:53.349 --> 00:50:15.349
It is underneath it is Only 3 things. Characters images. 4 things. Image is, graphic curves and hyperlinks.

00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:25.801
That's all you get. There were no words. There are no circles. D, there are simply these primitives in the PDF.

00:50:25.951 --> 00:50:40.951
And the software has to try and do its best. To make some sense of it. I mean, in its most primitive form, PDF is simply a set of characters on the page and that's what people might use for.

00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:51.501
Let's just say flyers or political slogans or whatever. But in Scotland the articles, it's usually, easier to do.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:51:08.050
Something better than that. So the raw material or a publication is usually a a document authored in Word or Lateck and submitted to a journal in that form.

00:51:07.901 --> 00:51:20.901
And in its most tractable form it is single column so spans the whole of the page. It does not have images embedded within the text.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:42.100
And it has separate sections or different concepts. So, this is what is seen in academic CCs and academic theses are far better for semantic purposes than scholarly publications including this one.

00:51:41.251 --> 00:51:54.251
We therefore deal in PDF with characters which have. Coordinates, they have a geometry and they have.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:52:04.650
Styling which is things like fonts. Colors. and other types of style.

00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:19.501
Images are bitmaps ideally in pd in tng Okay. And we can also get curves out.

00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:32.051
Where the material has been published in semantic. Or implicit semantic graphic form. Such as in SVG.

00:52:31.451 --> 00:52:43.451
And, those curves can sometimes be turned into higher level objects such as chemical formulae or phylogenetic trees.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:52.800
We have to turn the characters into text and to, to do this we have to use heuristics to tell which are words.

00:52:52.369 --> 00:53:02.369
So the size of space matters, we have to know what the line end means. Is it continuing to next line or is it a list?

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:13.450
And that requires a lot of heuristics. We, it is often per publisher, dependent, so different publishers use different approaches.

00:53:07.201 --> 00:53:43.201
So, another problem we have to contend with is there are probably 200 major scholarly publishers and publications and each of them uses a different type of publication and each of them mixes up content with non content, and such as advertising or author scores and things of that sort making it incredibly difficult.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:50.650
To do that and we may have to come down to having a per publisher, cementifier.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:54:03.850
And all these articles. Right. So that's discover, that's talked about, what we need and what the tooling is.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:12.400
And we will go now onto our examples. I see that it's come up to.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:22.750
An hour. I suggest what we do is we break but we come back almost immediately because I've seen others in my brain and I want to keep going.

00:54:22.449 --> 00:54:34.449
So, are there any questions or comments before we go on? What we're going to deal in the second Part is our examples.

00:54:35.249 --> 00:54:45.249
How we work. And the structure of our software. And where we are going in the future. Does that all make sense to people?

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:54.450
Yeah, the also talking about the difference between. Oh, open access.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:55:00.900
Probably in one or 2, I mean, I've talked about it a bit, but not in detail.

00:54:54.649 --> 00:55:17.649
And what we have to do, I think, is to, Yeah, we'll do a, we'll do a podcast, you know, one of these, monologues on this, and then we will hyperlink to it.

00:55:07.949 --> 00:55:08.949
So.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:31.650
Because we've only got we got 10 pages so we have to come up with 4 or 5 sentences about open access which say open access currently does this does not do this.

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:21.149
How about you? Yes.

00:55:33.849 --> 00:55:41.849
And we have discussed it in detail in this. Transcript and in this, video. That's a very good point.

00:55:44.599 --> 00:55:45.599
Yeah.

00:55:48.249 --> 00:55:59.249
Okay. Well, now we're going to close down and I'm going to, Amy's feeling she needs some blue tea to keep her going.

00:56:00.499 --> 00:56:08.499
So we 1st of all save transcript. We then. Stop recording!
