It follows that we cannot, without an additional argument, request that parents take the natural resources that their offspring will need from their own budgets. Nevertheless, it does not follow that <italic>all</italic> procreative acts can be exempted in the determination of the fair allocation of ecological resources. After all, the fundamental interest for which procreation is needed is, ostensibly, the existential experiences and relationship delivered by parenting; it is not having as many babies as you like. And as several philosophers have argued, there are very good reasons why our moral right to have children is limited to protect the natural resources that will be available to future generations, natural resources that future generations will need to meet their fundamental interest in parenting or to meet their basic needs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn41">41</xref></p>
