However, climate change mitigation also has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. There has been a&#160;strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per-capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation. However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions. Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerability and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development. Pathways that illustrate movement towards fulfilling the SDGs are shown in Figure&#160;TS.1. {1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17}</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.94" top="222.66"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.26; y0: 222.66; y1: 232.16; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="222.66" x1="304.94">The transition to a&#160;low-carbon economy depends on a&#160;wide range of closely intertwined drivers and constraints, including policies and technologies where notable advances over the past decade have opened up new and large-scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative development pathways which could deliver multiple social and developmental goals (</span><span style="x0: 169.28; x1: 174.21; y0: 150.67; y1: 160.17; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCnIta;" x0="169.28" y0="150.67" x1="234.32">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 234.32; x1: 237.14; y0: 150.67; y1: 160.17; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="234.32" y0="150.67" x1="241.84">). </span><span x0="244.24" y0="150.67" x1="304.88" style="x0: 244.24; x1: 249.69; y0: 150.67; y1: 160.17; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Drivers for, and constraints on, low-carbon societal transitions comprise economic and technological factors (the means by which services such as food, heating and shelter are provided and for whom, the emissions intensity of traded products, finance and investment), socio-political issues (political economy, equity and fairness, social innovation and&#160;behaviour change), and institutional factors (legal framework and institutions, and the quality of international cooperation).

The interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to, and support for, climate policies and low-carbon societal transitions has generally increased, as the impacts have become more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and balance of high- and low-carbon investments. Societal and behavioural norms, regulations and institutions are essential conditions to accelerate low-carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major transition. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had far-reaching impacts on the global economic and social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation.
