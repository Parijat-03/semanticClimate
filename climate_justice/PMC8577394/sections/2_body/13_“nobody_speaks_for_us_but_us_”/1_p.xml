In the Lower East Side, this old division emerged to produce conflict among residents, but with an added dimension. A rift in the temporal horizons of present day risks versus future climate change, working as a new feature of the old division between conservation and environmental justice, came to characterize a bitter divide in the neighborhood. While representatives of public housing residents by the coast explicitly prioritized long-term protection from future floods and sea level rise, older white activist leaders highlighted their present-day use of environmental amenities &#8211; composting facilities, existing vegetation and animal habitats, and leisure space &#8211; as reasons why they resisted the project.</p>
