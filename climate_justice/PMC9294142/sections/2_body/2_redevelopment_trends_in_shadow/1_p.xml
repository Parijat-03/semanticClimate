For this study, information on stadia and arenas home to professional hockey, basketball, football, soccer, rugby, or cricket teams over the last 110 years around the world was collected and analyzed to address how cities address their shadow stadia. Olympic venues, motor-specific tracks, war purpose venues, or renovated structures were excluded from the analysis. Primary sources included press releases, council reports, first-hand accounts, legal documents, sports league Bylaws and Constitutions, magazines, newsletters, blogs, and data collected from Google Maps regarding the shadow stadia's recent physical state. The analysis also included academic studies, articles from major newspapers, and periodicals for secondary information on development trends. Through the analysis, 283 shadow stadia across 22 countries were found and collated. The redevelopment plans for shadow stadia were categorized in seven ways, including: <italic>mixed-use redevelopment, grocery/retail, residential, replacement stadia, and infrastructure on the existing site, community facilities, site vacancies</italic>, and <italic>other</italic>. Each category is described in more detail while including future circularity imaginaries for shadow stadia site redevelopment planning. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates this categorization in detail.</p>
