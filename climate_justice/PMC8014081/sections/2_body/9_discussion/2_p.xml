Further the second theme and the literature that supported this theme indicated that there is a global role for addressing human&#8208;environment challenges. The third theme offered a lens on both a community and a global perspective on COVID&#8208;19 and climate change. Theme four supported the environmental impacts that uniquely occur due to both COVID&#8208;19 and climate change health consequences, which included a focus on the built environment. Finally, the fifth theme addressed the roles of professional associations&#8217; and specialty associations&#8217; views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID&#8208;19 and climate change.</p>
