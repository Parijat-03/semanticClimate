      <td>confidence). It is very unlikely that gas clathrates (mostly methane) in deeper terrestrial permafrost and subsea clathrates will lead to a\ndetectable departure from the emissions trajectory during this century. Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in biogeochemical\ncycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century atmospheric GHG concentrations, but future anthropogenic emissions remain the\ndominant uncertainty (high confidence). There is potential for abrupt water cycle changes in some high emissions scenarios, but there\nis no overall consistency regarding the magnitude and timing of such changes. Positive land surface feedbacks, including vegetation,\ndust, and snow, can contribute to abrupt changes in aridity, but there is only low confidence that such changes will occur during\nthe 21st century. Continued Amazon deforestation, combined with a warming climate, raises the probability that this ecosystem will\ncross a tipping point into a dry state during the 21st century (low confidence).
