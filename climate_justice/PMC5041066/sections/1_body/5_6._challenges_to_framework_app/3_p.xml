Instead, this framework expands the notion of effectiveness to allow for an assessment at an early stage in adaptation implementation: changes to determinants of health are likely detected earlier than effects on specific health outcomes&#8212;particularly since the pathways between climate change adaptation and health effects are multi-faceted and long-term.</p>
