Students will already feel a level of uncertainty and unfamiliarity with clinic arrangements if they are different to what they have encountered in their other studies. They should be encouraged to see their clinic experience as an opportunity to develop both technical and technological knowledge, becoming more confident in their ability to become competent in using a range of digital platforms. Remote delivery provides strong opportunities for students&#160;to build skills and awareness for future employability and to build a portfolio to demonstrate their capacity to learn in a workplace.</p>
