When EU Member States seek to maximize emission allowances within an equity-compatible range, particularly if only one equity dimension is desired to minimize complexity, the capability dimension emerges as the indicator of choice&#8212;across all the potential negotiation space it has by far the highest weight among all dimensions and even when varying across all interpretations. And this is exactly what the EU has done in its 2018 effort-sharing regulation and the EC has again implemented in its 2021 proposal.</p>
