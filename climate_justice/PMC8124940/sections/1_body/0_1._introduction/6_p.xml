Specifically, we seek to determine if socially vulnerable groups in Delhi are disproportionately exposed to urban heat, while also residing in areas with relatively little greenspace. The main research questions for this study are: (1) How does the spatial distribution of urban heat and greenspace in May (pre-monsoon) relate to the spatial distribution of socially vulnerable groups in Delhi&#8217;s neighborhoods? (2) How does this relationship change with seasonal variations in temperature, as denoted by the distribution of urban heat and greenspace in September (post-monsoon)? For the first question, we hypothesize that socially vulnerable groups will be more likely to reside in neighborhoods with higher urban heat and lower vegetation in May, so that a situation of climate injustice will become visible in Delhi. The second question then seeks to examine the extent to which this greater exposure to urban heat and lack of vegetation continues in September, or is mitigated due to monsoonal conditions.</p>
