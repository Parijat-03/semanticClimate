<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0025">In the next section we explore what a sustainable and resilient food system entails. Next we zoom in on the dual role women play in food systems, both as primary food producers and as primary caretakers of the household. Following, we explore the gender barriers women face in performing these roles and how this exacerbates food insecurity, not only at the individual level but also at the global food system level. Then we look at the increased risks induced by crises and what can be learned from the 2008 food price spike, climate change and COVID-19 pandemic. This paper will conclude with some general reflections on the current food security paradigm and three key recommendations for inclusive future food systems.</p>
