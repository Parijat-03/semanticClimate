<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Participants registered prior to the program via an online survey (REDCap secure
web application) and provided demographic information (gender, age,
race/ethnicity, location, and scope of practice). Attendance data were tracked
using reports generated by the Zoom platform. Unique attendees were defined as
people who attended at least once and for at least 10&#8197;min. Registration and
attendance data were linked together using name and email. Geographic
information was mapped using QGIS Version 3.18.3 and natural breaks, using the
Jenks method, were used.</p>
