<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One critique of CES (that can apply to the SVI and HHAI) is that as a state-wide tool, it is less sensitive to regional variations. That is, heat vulnerability can be the result of different factors in different environments and also require different adaptation strategies. The paper takes this up at line 322, but this section would be expanded upon. What is it about each tool that produces this pattern? Breaking out their analysis by region (exploring whether the tools different in their ability to identify high heat vulnerable communities) would provide some useful data for state agencies charged with using them.</p>
