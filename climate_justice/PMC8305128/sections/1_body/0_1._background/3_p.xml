These studies have pointed out that any condition that promotes an inflammatory response could exacerbate the effects of the coronavirus. Exposure to air pollutants increases the probability of contracting infectious diseases due to their oxidative effect, which alters the immune response and the permeability of cells to viral entry [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This increases the morbidity and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in places with high levels of pollution [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
