Concern regarding this relative inattention to vulnerable populations within the U.S. led to the establishment of Executive Order 12898 by President Bill Clinton in 1994 directing &#8220;Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income Populations&#8221; [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This action resonates with Ebi, Lindgren, Suk, and Semenza&#8217;s assertion that the degree to which health risks affect humans is determined not only by the changing climate but also by who and what is exposed and the population&#8217;s vulnerabilities [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-13-00189" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vice Admiral Vivek H. Murthy, the Surgeon General of the United States, remarked at the Summit on Climate Change and Health (23 June 2015) &#8220;Climate change is therefore not just a health issue but a moral issue and each of us has the responsibility to do what we can, as much as we can, for as long as we can.&#8221; </p>
