I particularly acknowledge all the courageous land and water defenders who came to the court as defendants. I wish to thank George Rammell and Joe Pepper for kindly allowing their artistic work to appear here, and also to the many people who shared insights, including land and water defenders, lawyers, fellow courtroom observers, and others. Any views expressed or errors here are solely my own responsibility. The research was made possible thanks to a <funding-source id="gs8">UK</funding-source>
