Certain neighborhoods are shouldering a disproportionate burden of urban heat risk [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This disproportionate risk exists regardless of urban heat islands, i.e., whether the city is hotter than surrounding rural landscapes. Policy makers and stakeholders may utilize these findings for targeted mitigation protocols, for example, involving increased vegetation, shading of paved surfaces, use of light-colored urban surface materials, and built form that creates ground-level shade. Cooling centers and other public health interventions may also be needed. Policies set forth to allocate resources and funds to neighborhoods that meet the criteria of certain income thresholds or demographics could be effective in smoothing the thermal inequity that is present in many cities.</p>
