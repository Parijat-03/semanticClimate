In this way, bringing theory into practice implies reducing the gap between the abstract and ambiguous concepts of sustainability and the concrete transformations that are being undertaken at the territorial level. For that, a real predisposition to an intercultural dialogue of knowledge and practices is fundamental, which implies tensions, conflicts, and pacts based on ethical relationships of respect for differences (Leff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>; Santos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2007</xref>; Cusicanqui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>; Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2009</xref>).</p>
