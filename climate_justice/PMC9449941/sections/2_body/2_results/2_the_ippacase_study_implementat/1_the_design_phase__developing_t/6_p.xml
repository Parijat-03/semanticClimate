Both core measures are flanked by ancillary measures in the field of infrastructure and communication. By promoting &#8220;intelligent charging points and tariff systems&#8221;, the aim is to prepare for the widespread integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid so that no new barriers to the diffusion of electric vehicles arise. In addition, a target group-specific &#8220;information campaign on electric mobility&#8221; aims to fill information gaps and provide neutral information on the entire spectrum of electric mobility. In addition, measures in place, such as the privileged treatment of electric vehicles under the German Electromobility Act (EmoG) or tax advantages for company cars need to be continued.</p>
