Current, but also past and expected future emissions, are not homogeneous between the north, south and east of the basin. For example, although historically northern countries have consumed more energy, moderate population growth, increased efficiency and a more stable economy have allowed a decrease in energy demand of 8% since 2010. It is also expected that consumption will continue to decrease in these countries and that the share of renewable energies will continue to increase. In contrast, southern Mediterranean countries have undergone sustained economic and population growth over recent decades and energy demand is expected to continue to increase in the coming decades [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
