      <td>Mitigation: Moderate benefits by conserving and enhancing carbon stocks in forests and long-lived products, through,\nfor example, selective logging (Smith et al. 2014) (Table 6.14). Adaptation: Large benefits, including through improving\necosystem functionality and services, with mostly qualitative evidence at global scale and more robust estimates at\nregional level and local scale (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Table 6.22). Desertification and land degradation: Large\nbenefits by helping to stabilise land and regulate water and microclimate (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Chapters 3 and 4,\nand Tables 6.30 and 6.38). Food security: Moderate benefits with mostly qualitative estimate at global level,\nby providing food to local communities, and diversify daily diets (Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits by maintaining carbon stocks in forest ecosystems (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14). Adaptation:\nModerate benefits at global scale when effect is cumulated until the end of the century; local scale, co-benefits between\nREDD+ and adaptation of local communities can be more substantial (Long 2013; Morita and Matsumoto 2018), even\nif often difficult to quantify and not explicitly acknowledged (McElwee et al. 2017a) (Table 6.22). Desertification and\nland degradation: Large benefits at global scale when effects are cumulated for at least 20 years, for example, through\nreduced soil erosion (Borrelli et al. 2017) (Tables 6.30 and 6.38). The uncertainty of these global estimates is high, while\nmore robust qualitative and some quantitative estimates are available at regional level. Food security: Small benefits;\ndifficult to quantify at global level (Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits by rebuilding the carbon stocks in forest ecosystems, although decreases in surface albedo\ncan reduce the net climate benefits, particularly in areas affected by seasonal snow cover (Sonntag et al. 2016; Mahmood\net al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14). Adaptation: Large benefits by provision of Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People,\nincluding improving ecosystem functionality and services, providing microclimatic regulation for people and crops, wood\nand fodder as safety nets, soil erosion protection and soil fertility enhancement for agricultural resilience, coastal area\nprotection, water and flood regulation (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Table 6.22). Desertification: Large benefits through\nrestoring forest ecosystems in dryland areas (Medugu et al. 2010; Salvati et al. 2014) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.30). Land\ndegradation: Large benefits by re-establishment of perennial vegetation (Ellison et al. 2017) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.38).\nFood security: Moderate negative impacts due to potential competition for land for food production (Frank et al. 2017)\n(Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).</td>

      <td>Mitigation: Large benefits for mitigation (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14), especially if it occurs in the tropics and in areas\nthat are not significantly affected by seasonal snow cover. Adaptation: Large benefits on adaptation (Kongsager et al.\n2016; Reyer et al. 2009) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.22).
