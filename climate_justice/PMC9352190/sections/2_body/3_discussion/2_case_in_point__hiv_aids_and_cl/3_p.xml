<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0021">From a climate perspective, the Philippines ranks 4th on the list of countries most affected by climate change from 2000 to 2019 <xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This high vulnerability to climate change is attributed to its archipelagic geography, tropical location, level of socioeconomic development, and limited adaptive capacity of governance and its institutions. Every year, an average of 20 typhoons hit the Philippines, bringing heavy rainfall, intense flooding, and strong winds, and inflicting enormous damage to communities. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of these typhoons <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, which can further intensify the amount of damage incurred, for instance in healthcare infrastructure, food systems, and human settlements. Meanwhile, slow-onset effects such as increasing ambient temperature and precipitation as well as sea level rise are also beginning to manifest in the Philippines, all of which can generate the aforementioned health impacts such as the rise in climate-sensitive mosquito- and water-borne diseases. Both the sudden and slow-onset impacts of climate change will have detrimental consequences for the Philippine population, including communities affected by HIV/AIDS. While the country has put in place policies that tackle the climate crisis such as the Climate Change Act and the National Climate Change Action Plan, attention to the climate impacts on the health sector remains limited, most especially for health-vulnerable populations such as PLHIV [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
