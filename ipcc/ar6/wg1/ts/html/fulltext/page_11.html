Baseline refers to a period against which anomalies (i.e., differences from the average value for the baseline period) are calculated. Examples include the 1750 baseline (used for anthropogenic radiative forcings), the 1850&#8211;1900 baseline (an approximation for pre-industrial global surface temperature from which global warming levels are calculated) and the 1995&#8211;2014 baseline (used for many climate model projections). A reference period indicates a time period over which various statistics are calculated (e.g., the near-term reference period, 2021&#8211;2040).

The five IPCC assessment cycles since 1990 have comprehensively and consistently laid out the rapidly accumulating evidence of a changing climate system, with the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 being the first to conclude that warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Sustained changes have been documented in all major elements of the climate system: the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean (Section TS.2). Multiple lines of evidence indicate the recent large-scale climatic changes are unprecedented in a multi-millennial context and that they represent a&#160;millennial-scale commitment for the slow-responding elements of the climate system, resulting in continued worldwide loss of ice, increase in ocean heat content, sea level rise and deep ocean acidification (Box TS.2; Section TS.2). {1.2.1, 1.3, Box&#160;1.2, 2.2, 2.3, Figure&#160;2.34, 5.1, 5.3, 9.2, 9.4&#8211;9.6, Appendix 1.A}</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="258.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="258.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.61; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: SBILBJ+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Earth&#8217;s climate system has evolved over many millions of years, and evidence from natural archives provides a long-term perspective on observed changes and projected changes over the coming centuries.
