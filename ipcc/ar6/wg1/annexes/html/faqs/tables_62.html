      <td>Human-caused climate change alters the frequency and intensity of climate variables (e.g., surface temperature)\nand phenomena (e.g., tropical cyclones) in a variety of ways. We now know that the ways in which average and\nextreme conditions have changed (and will continue to change) depend on the variable and the phenomenon\nbeing considered. Changes in local surface temperature extremes closely follow the corresponding changes in\nlocal average surface temperatures. On the contrary, changes in precipitation extremes (heavy precipitation)\ngenerally do not follow those in average precipitation, and can even move in the opposite direction (e.g., with</td>

Observations of the recent past and climate model projections show that,\nin most places, changes in daily temperatures are dominated by a general warming where the climatological\naverage and extreme values are shifted towards higher temperatures, making warm extremes more frequent and\ncold extremes less frequent. The top panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure 1 show projected changes in surface temperature\nfor long-term average conditions (left) and for extreme hot days (right) during the warm season (summer in mid-\nto high latitudes). Projected increases in long-term average temperature differ substantially between different\nplaces, varying from less than 3&#176;C in some places in central South Asia and southern South America to over 7&#176;C\nin some places in North America, North Africa and the Middle East. Changes in extreme hot days follow changes\nin average conditions quite closely, although, in some places, the warming rates for extremes can be intensified\n(e.g., southern Europe and the Amazon basin) or weakened (e.g., northern Asia and Greenland) compared to</td>

      <td>extremes (including both rainfall and snowfall extremes) differing drastically from those in average precipitation.\nThe bottom panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure 1 show projected changes in the long-term average precipitation (left)\nand in heavy precipitation (right). Averaged precipitation changes show striking regional differences, with\nsubstantial drying in places such as southern Europe and northern South America and wetting in places such as\nthe Middle East and southern South America. Changes in extreme precipitation are much more uniform, with\nsystematic increases over nearly all land regions. The physical reasons behind the different responses of averaged\nand extreme precipitation are now well understood. The intensification of extreme precipitation is driven by\nthe increase in atmospheric water vapour (about 7% per 1&#176;C of warming near the surface), although this is\nmodulated by various dynamical changes. In contrast, changes in average precipitation are driven not only by\nmoisture increases but also by slower processes that constrain future changes over the globe to only 2&#8211;3% per</td>
