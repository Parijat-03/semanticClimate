Since the 1990s, &#8220;green jobs&#8221; and economic development frames have emerged along with some partnerships between unions and environmentalists (e.g., the United Steelworkers and the Sierra Club in the BlueGreen Alliance, (Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>). These partnerships have reduced the longstanding image of environmental policy as a threat to working-class jobs; however, not all unions support the &#8220;green jobs&#8221; approach, and mistrust and opposition remain. For example, in some states, utilities have worked closely with their own workers and unions to mobilize opposition to energy-transition policies and fossil-fuel opposition (e.g., anti-pipeline mobilizations) by arguing that the opposition policies will harm local economies, taking away jobs. In states with a strong extractive fossil-fuel sector, anti-green labor alliances can also extend beyond utility unions to unions and other workers in the mining, drilling, and processing industries.</p>
