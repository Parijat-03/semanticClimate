<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A second discussion paper by Catton (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) identified pan&#8208;national challenges such as COVID&#8208;19 and potentially other emerging infectious diseases and pandemics in our warming planet. He noted the critical message of the International Council of Nurses&#8217; position statement on <italic toggle="yes">Nurses, Climate Change, and Health</italic> which addressed the role of nurses globally in engaging in the critical public health issues that have emerged due to climate change. In addressing the emergent nature of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and its intersection with public health and climate change, Catton (<xref rid="phn12866-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) suggested that the next decades of the 21st century have looming geopolitical and environmental challenges that affect public health systems, health care infrastructure, and the nursing workforce.</p>
