<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0160">We see this hesitancy to return to &#8220;normalcy&#8221; among both policymakers and society at large. Policymakers are not simply talking about &#8220;building back better&#8221; but are implementing interventions to support a green recovery and tying organizational bailouts to sustainability targets. Society at large has experienced some positive changes as a result of lockdown and might not want to return to its old ways. Seizing the opportunity and making interventions to &#8220;lock in&#8221; change should be pursued.</p>
