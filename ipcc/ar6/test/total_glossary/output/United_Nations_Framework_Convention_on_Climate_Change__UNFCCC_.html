The Convention&#8217;s ultimate objective is the &#8216;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&#8217; (UNFCCC, 1992). The provisions of the Convention are pursued and implemented by two further treaties: the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.</p></div></dd><div>
