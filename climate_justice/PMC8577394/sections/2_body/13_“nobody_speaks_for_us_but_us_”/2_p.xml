This impression is understandable, since most vocalized or written responses to the plan were negative (e.g. see public comments submitted to the project&#8217;s Environmental Review Statement [NYC Parks and Budget Office, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2019</xref>]). To be clear, almost everyone in the neighborhood participating in the process viewed the city&#8217;s change of plans as a blow to the legitimacy of the project. Yet as I spent more time in the neighborhood, I began learning that a group of repeat-players were the loudest voices against the new plan. These individuals, often middle-aged, white leaders of community-based organizations and long-time activists, implicitly presented their views as representative of the neighborhood and frequently made references to &#8220;the community&#8221; as a homogenous unit. In the Lower East Side, it was activists, mostly white, who purported to speak for the interests of the entire community, including public housing residents.</p>
