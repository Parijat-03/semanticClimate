<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0410">Building more resilient food systems will require improving the enabling conditions for sustainable farm systems, which provide fair and equitable livelihood opportunities (e.g. <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">FOLU, 2019</xref>). This entails also considering the interlinkages across various components of the food systems, such as examining how producers and consumers are linked through value chains and considering current power imbalances, which are embedded in many food systems today (<xref rid="bb0710" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2021</xref>). Helping farm systems manage and adapt to multiple environmental and socioeconomic risks will require targeted innovations in technologies and practices (as further discussed in section 5.3). Where farming livelihoods will become unsustainable over time due to climate change or other risk factors, policies and measures need to put into place to facilitate the timely transition into less vulnerable livelihoods.</p>
