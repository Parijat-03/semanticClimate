Indeed, climate change is already negatively affecting the livelihoods and welfare of island inhabitants and may even jeopardize the existence of small islands through submergence (e.g., Bellard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Sea-level rise may also increase coastal erosion and saline water intrusion, further impacting ecosystem services and livelihoods (Brown et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>; Failler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).</p>
