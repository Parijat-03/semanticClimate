As global warming compounds beyond 1.5&#176;C, however, the likelihood of adverse impacts on agricultural and food security in many parts of developing Asia increases (Mendelsohn, 2014; IPCC, 2018b). There is a growing trend towards more integrated studies and modelling that combines biophysical and socioeconomic variables (including management practices) in the context of changing climate to reduce uncertainty associated with future impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector (see, for instance, Mason-D&#8217;Croz et&#160;al., 2016; Smeets Kristkova et&#160;al., 2016; Gaydon et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="54.14" right="168.05" top="210.63"><span style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.7; y0: 210.63; y1: 220.13; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="54.14" y0="210.63" x1="168.05">10.4.5.2.3 Livestock production</span></div><div left="54.14" right="308.23" top="186.63"><span x0="54.14" y0="186.63" x1="308.23" style="x0: 54.14; x1: 58.36; y0: 186.63; y1: 196.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is hardly any mention about the impacts of climate change on livestock production in the Asia chapter of AR5 due to limited studies on this area.

The use of scenarios and models to determine alternative futures with participatory engagement processes has been recommended for informed policy and decision making with potential application in the livestock sector (Mason-D&#8217;Croz et&#160;al., 2016).

In the Mongolian Altai Mountains, early snowmelt and an extended growing season have resulted in reduced herder mobility and prolonged pasture use, which has in turn initiated grassland degradation (Lkhagvadorj et&#160;al., 2013a). Furthermore, reduced herder mobility has increased the pressure on forests resulting in increased logging for fuel and construction wood and reduced regeneration due to browsing damage by increasing goat populations (Khishigjargal et&#160;al., 2013; Dulamsuren et&#160;al., 2014).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.07" top="606.66"><span x0="317.96" y0="606.66" x1="572.07" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 320.25; y0: 606.66; y1: 616.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In terms of direct impacts, climate-change-induced heat stress and reduced water availability are </span><span style="x0: 427.21; x1: 429.31; y0: 594.66; y1: 604.16; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="427.21" y0="594.66" x1="447.48">likely </span><span x0="447.94" y0="594.66" x1="572.05" style="x0: 447.94; x1: 450.76; y0: 594.66; y1: 604.16; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to generally have negative effects on livestock (ADB, 2017b). In the HKH region, climate change has induced severe impacts on livestock through degradation of rangelands, pastures and forests (Hussain et&#160;al., 2019). However, indirect effects may be positive such as in Uzbekistan and South Asia where alfalfa and grassland productivity is expected to improve under warming conditions, which have beneficial effects on livestock production (Sutton et&#160;al., 2013; Weindl et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.06" top="486.68"><span x0="317.96" y0="486.68" x1="572.06" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 323.41; y0: 486.68; y1: 496.18; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">At the global level, analysis involving 148&#160;countries in terms of the potential vulnerability of their livestock sector to climate and population change shows that some Asian nations, particularly Mongolia, are </span><span style="x0: 370.66; x1: 372.77; y0: 450.68; y1: 460.18; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="370.66" y0="450.68" x1="391.22">likely </span><span x0="391.46" y0="450.68" x1="572.06" style="x0: 391.46; x1: 394.27; y0: 450.68; y1: 460.18; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">to be the most vulnerable while South Asia is the most vulnerable region (Godber and Wall, 2014).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="472.55" top="414.69"><span style="x0: 317.96; x1: 322.52; y0: 414.69; y1: 424.19; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="317.96" y0="414.69" x1="472.55">10.4.5.2.4 Farming systems and crop areas</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.05" top="390.69"><span x0="317.96" y0="390.69" x1="572.05" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 322.17; y0: 390.69; y1: 400.19; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There is new evidence since AR5 that farming systems and crop areas will change in many parts of Asia in response to climate change. In South Asia, a study in Nepal showed that farmers are inclined to change practices in cropland use to reduce climate-change risk (Chalise and Naranpanawa, 2016). In India, climate change is also predicted to lead to boundary changes in areas suitable for growing certain crops (Srinivasa Rao et&#160;al., 2016). A study in Bangladesh revealed a shift in crop choices among farmers, implying changes in the future rice-cropping pattern. Specifically, a temperature increase will compel farmers to choose irrigation-based Boro, Aus and other crops in favour of the rain-fed Aman rice crop (Moniruzzaman, 2015).</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.06" top="246.71"><span x0="317.96" y0="246.71" x1="572.06" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 320.25; y0: 246.71; y1: 256.21; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In the coastal area of Odisha in India, adverse impact on the agriculture sector is anticipated considering the increasing temperature trends over the past 30&#160;years for all the seasons (Mishra and Sahu, 2014). In a national study that groups Bangladesh into 16 sub-regions with similar farming areas, simulations of a 62&#160;cm rise in mean sea level project damages to production because of area loss in excess of 31% in sub-region&#160;15 and nearly 40% in sub-region&#160;16 (Ruane et&#160;al., 2013). Also in Bangladesh, a study on predicting the design of water requirements for winter paddy rice under climate change conditions shows that agricultural water resource management will help minimise drought risk and implement future agricultural water resource policies (Islam et&#160;al., 2018) that may have important implications for crop areas and production.</span></div><div left="317.96" right="572.02" top="78.73"><span x0="317.96" y0="78.73" x1="572.02" style="x0: 317.96; x1: 320.25; y0: 78.73; y1: 88.23; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In East Asia, the observed changes in agricultural flooding in different parts of China could influence farming systems and crop areas (Zhang et&#160;al., 2016b) as extreme events intensify in the context of changing </span></div></body></html>
