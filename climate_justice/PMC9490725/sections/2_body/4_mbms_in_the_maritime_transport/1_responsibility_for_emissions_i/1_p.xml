The share of shipping emissions in global anthropogenic GHG emissions increased from 2.76% in 2012 to 2.89% in 2018, with all types of emissions experiencing increases (IMO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). GHG emissions are projected to increase by anything up to 50% by 2050 for a range of six long-term economic and energy scenarios, with even the IMO&#8217;s best-case scenario showing no reduction in carbon emissions from 2018 to 2050 (IMO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>).</p>
