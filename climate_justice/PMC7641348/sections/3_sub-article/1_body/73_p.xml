This is a methodologically-oriented article that develops and applies a rigorous, if not entirely novel, comparative approach to three different heat vulnerability indices in California. It makes the important point that models matter and that designation of areas as vulnerable to extreme heat depends greatly on the type of index used. The article applies this analysis to a critique of state climate adaptation funding.</p>
