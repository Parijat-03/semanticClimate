[<xref rid="B84-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] designed an aquaponics unit for vegetables and fish. The design consists of a 12V DC pump that delivers water from the fish tank to the flood tank, which then supplies the area where the crops are planted at a constant rate. As soon as water is removed from the fish pond, it is carried by gravity through the grow bed area, where it is stored until it is needed for watering the vegetable bed. The pump is powered using a solar panel of 150-Watt with a 120 Ah battery.</p>
