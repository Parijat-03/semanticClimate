It is also inadequate to support the needed increase in private sector investments as per blended finance arrangements. Millan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>) make the case for public sector investments to address core market failures to create new sustainable investment opportunities that will stimulate private investment flows. This involves investments in data and information, risk management mechanisms and regulatory approaches that embed environmental values into market transactions (Millan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>).</p>
