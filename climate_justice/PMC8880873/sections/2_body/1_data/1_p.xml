<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We have constructed an original database of wind installations drawing data from multiple sources. For our dependent variable, the presence of wind turbines (henceforth wind installed capacity), we use Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data on built wind turbines from 1995 to January 2021. All wind turbines in the U.S. require an FAA permit, which precisely documents the location of the turbine. FAA shares the resulting Obstruction Analysis / Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) dataset with natural resource management agencies, which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#8217;s Ecological Services posts in a somewhat more user-friendly format than the FAA does [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To identify turbines on federally recognized tribal lands, we overlay FAA turbine location data with the Bureau of Indian Affairs&#8217; American Indian and Alaska Native Land Area Representation (AIAN-LAR) Geographic Information System dataset [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. AIAN-LAR includes all tribes that have a land base. Tribes that have federal recognition but without a land base are excluded from AIAN-LAR.</p>
