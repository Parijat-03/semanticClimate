In this regard, the improvement of energy efficiency, electrifications of end-users using renewables, focusing on direct renewable heat and biomass, indirect use of renewable electricity thought feedsocks, e-fuels and green hydrogen are all pieces of the bigger puzzle. The application of carbon capture and storage technologies as a transitional solution for economies heavily dependent on fossil fuels can be applied in some cases.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> The action plan includes the alignment of energy and industrial policies to ensure that no one is left behind by having skills and tools necessary to contribute to the transition. Limited skills and knowledge remain key bottlenecks. Increased investments in research and development as well as innovation would allow Small and Medium Entrepreses (SMEs) and hard-to abate sectors to transition to renewables. Stimulating the demand for low-carbon products and services is both in the hands of public and private sector. Yet again, digitalization is imperative to better data and transparency, which leads to better decision making by both the government and the industry.</p>
