There is currently a shortage of affordable rental housing in the USA according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition as indicated by Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> below. No state in the USA has enough affordable rentals for the demand. In some states, there are less than 1/3 of the rental properties available than are needed, especially in high-risk states. This situation is only exacerbated by the impacts to housing stock and prices in local areas following a disaster.
