<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Since the industrial revolution in the early 1800s, humans have added carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere causing global heating of about 1&#176;C, and this is now increasing exponentially [<xref rid="RSOS210006C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS210006C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), backed by the world's governments, urged a reduction of emissions of 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels to keep heating to relatively safe levels [<xref rid="RSOS210006C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in land use, energy systems, buildings and transportation [<xref rid="RSOS210006C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, after 30 years of international talks, there is no binding treaty on emission reductions, nor are most governments doing enough locally [<xref rid="RSOS210006C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An alternative avenue is for collective action movements to grow at the grassroots, which will eventually lead to political pressure [<xref rid="RSOS210006C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While such groups do already exist (e.g. Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org and Fridays for Future), the overall membership is still small. In this study, we aim to better understand the psychological factors that drive individuals to join collective action.</p>
