However, to date Earth system models (ESMs) incorporate some combined biophysical and biogeochemical processes only to limited extent and many relevant processes about how plants and soils interactively respond to climate changes are still to be included (Section 2.7). And even within this class of models, the spread in ESM projections is large, in part because of their varying ability to represent land&#8211;climate processes (Hoffman et&#160;al. 2014).
