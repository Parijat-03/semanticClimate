The first is through co-financing arrangements with dedicated climate finance institutions such as Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund. The second channel is through climate-related development finance. These are funds that promote economic and social development with climate change co-benefits (Murphy &amp; Parry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). In 2019 about 94 percent of the MDB financing for adaptation to low and middle income countries was climate-related development finance, with only 6 percent from MDB managed external resources (Joint report MDBs,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p>
