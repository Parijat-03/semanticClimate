      <td>Future development of socio-economic factors and policies influence the evolution of the land&#8211;climate system, among others, in terms\nof the land used for agriculture and forestry. Climate mitigation policies can also have a major impact on land use, especially in\nscenarios consistent with the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. This includes the use of bio-energy or CDR, such as bioenergy with\ncarbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation. Land-based mitigation options have implications for GHG fluxes, desertification,\nland degradation, food insecurity, ecosystem services and other aspects of sustainable development.</td>

      <td>Rogelj et al. 2018b) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). SSP1 is a scenario with a broad focus on sustainability, including human\ndevelopment, technological development, nature conservation, globalised economy, economic convergence and early international\ncooperation (including moderate levels of trade). The scenario includes a peak and decline in population, relatively high agricultural\nyields and a move towards food produced in low-GHG emission systems (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b). Dietary change and reductions\nin food waste reduce agricultural demands, and effective land-use regulation enables reforestation and/or afforestation. SSP2 is\na scenario in which production and consumption patterns, as well as technological development, follows historical patterns (Fricko\net al. 2017). Land-based CDR is achieved through bioenergy and BECCS and, to a lesser degree, by afforestation and reforestation.\nSSP3 is a scenario with slow rates of technological change and limited land-use regulation. Agricultural demands are high due to\nmaterial-intensive consumption and production, and barriers to trade lead to reduced flows for agricultural goods. In SSP3, forest\nmitigation activities and abatement of agricultural GHG emissions are limited due to major implementation barriers such as low\ninstitutional capacities in developing countries and delays as a consequence of low international cooperation (Fujimori et al. 2017).\nEmissions reductions are achieved primarily through the energy sector, including the use of bioenergy and BECCS.</td>

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) represent the effect of these policies on the economy, energy\nsystem, land use and climate with the caveat that they are assumed to be effective or, in some cases, the policy goals (e.g., dietary\nchange) are imposed rather than explicitly modelled. In the real world, there are various barriers that can make policy implementation\nmore difficult (Section 7.4.9). These barriers will be generally higher in SSP3 than SSP1.</td>

      <td>SSP1: A number of policies could support SSP1 in future, including: effective carbon pricing, emission trading schemes (including net CO\n2\nemissions from agriculture), carbon taxes, regulations limiting GHG emissions and air pollution, forest conservation (mix of land sharing\nand land sparing) through participation, incentives for ecosystem services and secure tenure, and protecting the environment,\nmicrofinance, crop and livelihood insurance, agriculture extension services, agricultural production subsidies, low export tax and\nimport tariff rates on agricultural goods, dietary awareness campaigns, taxes on and regulations to reduce food waste, improved\nshelf life, sugar/fat taxes, and instruments supporting sustainable land management, including payment for ecosystem services,\nland-use zoning, REDD+, standards and certification for sustainable biomass production practices, legal reforms on land ownership\nand access, legal aid, legal education, including reframing these policies as entitlements for women and small agricultural producers\n(rather than sustainability) (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b; O&#8217;Neill et al. 2017) (Section 7.4).</td>

      <td>SSP2: The same policies that support SSP1 could support SSP2 but may be less effective and only moderately successful. Policies\nmay be challenged by adaptation limits (Section 7.4.9), inconsistency in formal and informal institutions in decision-making\n(Section 7.5.1) or result in maladaptation (Section 7.4.7). Moderately successful sustainable land management policies result in some\nland competition. Land degradation neutrality is moderately successful. Successful policies include those supporting bioenergy and BECCS\n(Rao et al. 2017b; Fricko et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017) (Section 7.4.6).</td>

      <td>SSP3: Policies that exist in SSP1 may or may not exist in SSP3, and are ineffective (O&#8217;Neill et al. 2014). There are challenges to\nimplementing these policies, as in SSP2. In addition, ineffective sustainable land management policies result in competition for\nland between agriculture and mitigation. Land degradation neutrality is not achieved (Riahi et al. 2017). Successful policies include\nthose supporting bioenergy and BECCS (Kriegler et al. 2017; Fujimori et al. 2017; Rao et al. 2017b) (Section 7.4.6). Demand-side\nfood policies are absent and supply-side policies predominate. There is no success in advancing land ownership and access policies\nfor agricultural producer livelihood (Section 7.6.5).</td>
