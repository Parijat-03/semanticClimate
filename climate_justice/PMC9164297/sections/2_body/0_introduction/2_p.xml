<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0005">This article reviews the literature that connects the co-production of knowledge for climate change adaptation with the SDGs, with the aim of identifying how and why processes of co-production may foster climate change adaptation in a broader sustainability context. Knowledge co-production is increasingly emerging both as a key for harnessing science for sustainable development (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Cash et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Norstr&#246;m et al., 2020</xref>) and as a prerequisite for adaptation to climate change (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Dilling and Lemos, 2011</xref>), referred to here as <italic>adaptation.</italic></p>
