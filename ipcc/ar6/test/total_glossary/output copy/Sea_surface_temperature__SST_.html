<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The subsurface bulk temperature in the top few metres of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys and drifters.</p>
<p>From ships, measurements of water samples in buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; a fraction of a millimetre thick) in the infrared or the top centimetre or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature.</p>
