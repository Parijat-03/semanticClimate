They gained experience in working in a team, in project and event management, and in rhetorical expression. In addition, change was expressed in another subcategory, <italic>mindfulness</italic>, which was also assigned to the main category of transfer knowledge, because of its transferability to other areas of life. Three of the interviewees reported phases in their engagement in which they had clearly exceeded their own stress limits and had overworked themselves. As a result, the initiatives had started to regularly check the capacities of the members and were currently very mindful of personal resources.</p>
