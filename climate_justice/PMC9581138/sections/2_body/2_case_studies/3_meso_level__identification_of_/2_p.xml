<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To assign research areas to projects we relied on the ESA approach of semantic analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). ESA combines statistical models with semantic background knowledge taken from Wikipedia pages. Every research area has a corresponding Wikipedia article in this model, which allows for the comparison of terms or documents regarding their semantic relation. By computing the similarities of project descriptions to research areas, it was possible to assign research areas to projects.</p>
