<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">At a basic level, there is minimal access to nature for BAME or inner-city young people. If you have never connected with nature, it is hard to care about the environment and so to campaign to stop climate change or species extinction. I have set up the not-for-profit organisation Black2Nature to facilitate young BAME people experiencing the countryside. I have organised 12 nature camps for BAME children, teenagers and families and have managed to get the young people engaged with nature. However, the teenagers who attend are excluded from the environmental movement including Youth Strikes and Extinction Rebellion Youth. They travel across the city to attend high achieving, predominantly white, affluent schools but describe huge racism in their schools impacting on their ability to do well. Racism also stops them from environmental campaigning. Some schools demand a permission letter from a parent for a young person to participate in a youth climate strike. BAME teenagers&#8217; parents often have language barriers, so cannot write letters, or may not understand the importance of the strikes. If the teenagers then try to attend the youth strike without a letter, they are put into isolation for the day and threatened with expulsion if they attend again.</p>
