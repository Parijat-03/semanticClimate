Pacific communities &#8220;rely heavily on terrestrial and marine ecosystems to provide services, including food security, water security, traditional medicine, building material, material for handicraft, coastal protection, etc.&#8221; and the environment is &#8220;the spiritual temple for the Fa&#8217;aSamoa (Samoan way of life)&#8221; (participants #31 and #1, 2020). Many studies have demonstrated the integral role that biodiversity and ecosystems play in providing critical material resources for nutrition and health, but also for the maintenance of cultural heritage and Indigenous knowledge (see Williams and Hardison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>; Asch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Hanich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>). The connectedness between socio-cultural and ecological aspects was clear as many stakeholders outlined that losses to biodiversity, ecosystems and environment translated to cascading impacts on knowledge, way of life and wellbeing:<disp-quote><p id="Par18">Climate change is impacting biodiversity and ecosystem services (drinking water, sources of food etc) everywhere (near the coast and in highlands all the same) and impacts a lot more people in the Pacific than the others [loss types]. These contribute to loss of ILK [Indigenous local knowledge] and reducing quality of human life (participant #23, 2020)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p id="Par19">&#8230;local knowledge will be affected by changes in the environment linked to increasing temperatures and change in rainfall&#8230; (participant #31, 2020)</p></disp-quote></p>
