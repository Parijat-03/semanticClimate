Risk perception is also affected by particular applications. In <xref rid="bibr20-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Mercer et al. (2011)</xref> survey, CDR was usually favoured over SRM. CDR&#8217;s technologies are often understood as &#8216;more natural&#8217; in part because FGs&#8217; facilitators unintentionally portrait them as such. The artificialness/naturalness dualism is one of the main factors influencing the public perception of these technologies (<xref rid="bibr9-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Corner et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
