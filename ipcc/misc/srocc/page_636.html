Climate change will likely increase demand for irrigation in dryland areas, which can increase risks of salinisation, diminishing the effectiveness of this response (Smith et&#160;al. 2015).

Biodiversity conservation, such as through protected areas or corridors, may be threatened by increased land expansion under agriculture in climate change scenarios, including the newly available land in northern climates that may become agriculturally suited (Gimona et&#160;al. 2012), lessening the effectiveness of this response option.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="179.67" top="99.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.81; y0: 99.55; y1: 109.05; width: 5.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="99.55" x1="179.67">Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): </span><span style="x0: 178.55; x1: 182.76; y0: 99.55; y1: 109.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="178.55" y0="99.55" x1="307.58">The ef&#64257;cacy of enhanced weathering is not likely to be affected by future climate changes.

For example, dietary change is not likely to be affected by climate change; in fact, the opposite is more likely, that diets will shift in response to climate change impacts as re&#64258;ected in high prices for some staple grains and meats, the productivity of which may be reduced (Tigchelaar et&#160;al. 2018). However, there is some indication that fruit and vegetable production will also be reduced in future scenarios, making healthier diets potentially harder to achieve in some regions (Springmann et&#160;al. 2016). Reduced post-harvest losses and reduced food waste may become an even more important option if water or heat stresses under climate change reduce overall harvests. Material substitution does have risks related to the availability of products if there are declines in the growth of forest and other biomass in certain future scenarios over time, although some evidence indicates that biomass may increase in the short term with limited warming (Boisvenue and Running 2006). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="467.47" top="459.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.8; y0: 459.59; y1: 469.09; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="459.59" x1="467.47">Supply management of value chains: </span><span style="x0: 467.75; x1: 471.97; y0: 459.59; y1: 469.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="467.75" y0="459.59" x1="566.09">Sustainable sourcing relies on being able to produce consumer goods sustainably (palm oil, timber, cocoa, etc.), and these may be at risk; for example, areas suitable for oil palm production are estimated to decrease by 75% by 2100 (Paterson et&#160;al. 2017). Improved management of supply chains is likely to increase in importance as a tool to manage food security, given that climate change threatens to lead to more production shocks in the future (Baldos and Hertel 2015). For enhanced urban food systems, climate stresses like heat island effects or increased water scarcity in urban areas may reduce the viability of food production in certain urban systems (da Silva et&#160;al. 2012). Improved food processing and retailing and improved energy use in agriculture are not likely to be impacted on by climate change. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="422.77" top="291.61"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.33; y0: 291.61; y1: 301.11; width: 5.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="291.61" x1="422.77">Risk management options: </span><span style="x0: 422.57; x1: 429.96; y0: 291.61; y1: 301.11; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="422.57" y0="291.61" x1="566.11">Most risk management response options are not affected by climate impacts </span><span style="x0: 441.91; x1: 446.47; y0: 279.61; y1: 289.11; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="441.91" y0="279.61" x1="462.81">per se</span><span style="x0: 462.68; x1: 464.96; y0: 279.61; y1: 289.11; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="462.68" y0="279.61" x1="566.1">, although the increased risks that people may face will increase the need for funding and support to deploy these options. For example, disaster risk management will likely increase in importance in helping people adapt to longer-term climate changes (Begum et&#160;al. 2014); it is also likely to cost more as increased impacts of climate change, such as intensi&#64257;cation or frequency of storm events, may increase. Management of urban sprawl may also be challenged by increased migration driven by climate change, as people displaced by climate change may move to unregulated urban areas (Adamo 2010). Livelihood diversi&#64257;cation can assist in adapting to climate changes and is not likely to be constrained as a response option, as climate-sensitive livelihoods may be replaced by others that are less so. Use of local seeds as an effective response option may depend on the speci&#64257;c types of seeds and crops used, as some may not be good choices under increased heat and water stress (Gross et&#160;al. 2017). Risk-sharing instruments are unlikely to be affected by climate change, with the exception of index and crop insurance, which may become unaffordable if too many climate shocks result in insurance claims, decreasing the ability of the industry to provide this tool (Mills 2005).</span></div></body></html>
