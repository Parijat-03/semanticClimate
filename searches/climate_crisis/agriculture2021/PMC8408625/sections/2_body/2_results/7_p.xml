These variables represent 2007 baseline regional GDP and central government spending growth. Regional GDP has a gentle negative association, but statistically significant relationship with WNV infections in the &#8220;Econ model specification&#8221;, but loses significance in the final model. The two indicators that directly represent central government spending on areas of the environment, such as agriculture, forest &amp; fisheries spending; and waste water management, have highly statistically significant negative associations with WNV infections.</p>
