<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0195">The role of trade has been much studied as a factor of stability in the food systems. For example, trade benefits have been demonstrated in the context of climate change, as some regions will lose their comparative advantages for the production of important staple crops (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Lecl&#232;re et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Mosnier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Gouel and Laborde, 2018</xref>). Modeling results suggests that trade liberalization would generally improve food security under various climate change scenarios (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Janssens et al., 2020</xref>). As discussed in later sections the role of trade in influencing the exposure and capacity to mitigate diverse multiple socioeconomic and environmental risks needs to be considered.</p>
