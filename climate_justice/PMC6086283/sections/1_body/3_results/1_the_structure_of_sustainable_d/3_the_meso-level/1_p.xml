<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par23">Nations, cultures and societies are the entities at the meso-level. The three texts address techno-scientific and ethical norms at this level in different ways. The Encyclical presents &#8220;society&#8221; as key entity and &#8220;solidarity&#8221; as key norm on the meso-level. Whereas in the PA and the SDGs norms strongly relate to techno-scientific issues (refer to &#8220;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Acceleration and centralization of change</xref>&#8221; section for the details), the Encyclical promotes &#8220;a different cultural paradigm&#8220;(Enc., 108). In this formulation climate actions on the meso-level are performed by &#8220;society&#8221; at large, less so by political entities. The Encyclical even envisions society and culture to be the antipodes of the national state by imposing &#8220;regulatory norms&#8221; (Enc., 173, 177) on it: &#8220;Society [&#8230;] must put pressure on governments to develop more rigorous regulations, procedures and controls&#8221; (Enc., 179).</p>
