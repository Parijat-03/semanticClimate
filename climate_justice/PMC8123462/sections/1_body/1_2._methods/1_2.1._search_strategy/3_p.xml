Studies from other interrelated literature reviews were also used to inform the paper, including grey literature, as this is where information around climate events is often first reported. This strategy reduced our study bias towards only peer reviewed literature. For instance, Health Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL), OpenDOAR, and the Assembly of First Nations were reviewed.</p>
