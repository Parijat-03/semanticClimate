Decision-makers balance climate ambitions, encapsulated in the NDCs, with other SDGs, which will differ considerably across different regions, sociocultural conditions and economic levels (Griggs et al. 2014). The interactions across SDGs also factor into decision-making processes (Nilsson et al. 2016b). The challenge is particularly acute in least developed countries where a large share of the population is vulnerable to climate change. Matching the structure of decision-making processes to local needs while connecting to national strategies and international regimes is challenging (Nilsson and Persson 2012). This section explores methods of decision-making to address the risks and inter-linkages outlined in the above sections. As a result, this section outlines policy inter-linkages with SDGs and NDCs, trade-offs and synergies in speci&#64257;c measures, possible challenges as well as opportunities going&#160;forward.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="491.64" top="315.56"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.12; y0: 315.56; y1: 325.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="315.56" x1="491.64">Even in cases where uncertainty exists, there is </span><span style="x0: 491.27; x1: 498.13; y0: 315.56; y1: 325.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="491.27" y0="315.56" x1="556.33">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 555.98; x1: 560.37; y0: 315.56; y1: 325.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="555.98" y0="315.56" x1="571.8">and </span><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.3; y0: 303.56; y1: 313.06; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.72" y0="303.56" x1="382.92">high agreement </span><span style="x0: 383.03; x1: 385.14; y0: 303.56; y1: 313.06; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="383.03" y0="303.56" x1="571.77">in the literature that it need not present a barrier to taking action, and there are growing methodological developments and empirical applications to support decision-making.

In the land sector, the degree of uncertainty varies and is particularly challenging for climate change adaptation decisions (Hallegatte 2009; Wilby and Dessai 2010). Some types of agricultural production decisions can be made in short timeframes as changes are observed, and will provide bene&#64257;ts in the current time period (Dittrich et&#160;al.&#160;2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="187.94" top="723.73"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.93; y0: 723.73; y1: 732.23; width: 4.56; font-size: 8.5; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="79.37" y0="723.73" x1="187.94">Cross-Chapter Box 11 (continued)</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.54" top="699.52"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 86.93; y0: 699.52; y1: 709.02; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="699.52" x1="557.54">Women&#8217;s economic empowerment, decision-making power and voice is a necessity in SLM decisions (Mello and Schmink 2017a; Theriault et al. 2017b). Policies that address barriers include: gender considerations as qualifying criteria for funding programmes or access to &#64257;nancing for initiatives; government transfers to women under the auspices of anti-poverty programmes; spending on health and education; and subsidised credit for women (medium con&#64257;dence) (Jagger and Pender 2006; Van Koppen et al. 2013a; Theriault et al. 2017b; Agarwal 2018b). Training and extension for women to facilitate sustainable practices is also important (Mello and Schmink 2017b; Theriault et al. 2017b). Such training could be built into existing programmes or structures, such as collective microenterprise (Mello and Schmink 2017b). Huyer et al. (2015) suggest that information provision (e.g., information about SLM) could be effectively dispersed through women&#8217;s community-based organisations, although not in such a way that it overwhelms these organisations or supersedes their existing missions. SLM programmes could also bene&#64257;t from intentionally engaging men in gender-equality training and efforts (Fletcher 2017), thus recognising the relationality of gender. Recognition of the household level, including men&#8217;s roles and power relations, can help avoid the decontextualised and individualistic portrayal of women as purely instrumental actors (Rao&#160;2017b).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.63" top="555.54"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 555.54; y1: 565.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="555.54" x1="557.63">Technology, policy, and programmes that exacerbate women&#8217;s workloads or reinforce gender stereotypes (MacGregor 2010; Huyer et al. 2015b), or which fail to recognise and value the contributions women already make (Doss et al. 2018b), may further marginalise women. Accordingly, some studies have described technological and labour interventions that can enhance sustainability while also decreasing women&#8217;s workloads; for example, Vent et al. (2017) described the system of rice intensi&#64257;cation as one such intervention. REDD+ initiatives need to be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve complementary synergies with gender dimensions. </span></div><div left="79.37" right="557.63" top="471.55"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 471.55; y1: 481.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="471.55" x1="557.63">Secure land title and/or land access and control for women increases SLM by increasing women&#8217;s conservation efforts, increasing&#160;their&#160;productive and environmentally bene&#64257;cial agricultural investments, such as willingness to engage in tree planting and&#160;sustainable soil management (high con&#64257;dence) as well as improving cash incomes (Higgins et al. 2018; Agarwal 2010; Namubiru-Mwaura 2014b; Doss et al. 2015b; Van Koppen et al. 2013b; Theriault et al. 2017b; Jagger and Pender 2006). According FAO (2011b,&#160;p.&#160;5), if women had the same access to productive resources as men, the number of hungry people in the world could be reduced by 12&#8211;17%. Policies promoting secure land title include legal reforms at multiple levels, including national laws on land ownership, legal education, and legal aid for women on land ownership and access (Argawal 2018). Policies to increase women&#8217;s access to land could occur through three main avenues of land acquisition: inheritance/family (Theriault et al. 2017b), state policy, and the market (Agarwal 2018). Rao (2017) recommends framing land rights as entitlements rather than as instrumental means to&#160;sustainability. This reframing may address persistent, pervasive gender inequalities (FAO 2015d). </span></div></body></html>
