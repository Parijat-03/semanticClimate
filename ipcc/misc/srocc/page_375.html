These proxies of land degradation include several indexes that have been used to assess land conditions, and monitoring changes of land conditions&#160;&#8211; for example, extent of gullies, severe forms of rill and sheet erosion, and de&#64258;ation. The presence of open-access, quality controlled and continuously updated global databases of remote sensing data is invaluable, and is the only method for consistent monitoring of large areas over several decades (Sedano et al. 2016; Brandt et al. 2018b; Turner 2014).The NDVI, as a&#160;proxy for Net Primary Production (NPP) (see Glossary), is one of the most commonly used methods to assess land degradation, since it indicates land cover, an important factor for soil protection. Although NDVI is not a&#160;direct measure of vegetation biomass, there is a&#160;close coupling between NDVI integrated over a&#160;season and in situ NPP (</span><span style="x0: 508.94; x1: 513.52; y0: 459.58; y1: 469.08; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="508.94" y0="459.58" x1="567.24">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 567.24; x1: 569.52; y0: 459.58; y1: 469.08; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="567.24" y0="459.58" x1="571.45">, </span><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 326.25; y0: 447.59; y1: 457.09; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="323.44" y0="447.59" x1="380.89">robust evidence</span><span style="x0: 380.89; x1: 383.53; y0: 447.59; y1: 457.09; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="380.89" y0="447.59" x1="571.46">) (see Higginbottom et al. 2014; Andela et al. 2013; Wessels et al. 2012). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.49" top="411.59"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 411.59; y1: 421.09; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="411.59" x1="571.49">Distinction between land degradation/improvement and the effects of climate variation is an important and contentious issue (Murthy and Bagchi 2018; Ferner et al. 2018). There is no simple and straightforward way to disentangle these two effects. The interaction of different determinants of primary production is not well understood. A&#160;key barrier to this is a&#160;lack of understanding of the inherent interannual variability of vegetation (Huxman et al. 2004; Knapp and Smith 2001; Ruppert et al. 2012; Bai et al. 2008a; Jobb&#225;gy and Sala 2000). One possibility is to compare potential land productivity modelled by vegetation models and actual productivity measured by remote sensing (Seaquist et al. 2009; Hickler et al. 2005; van der Esch et al. 2017), but the difference in spatial resolution, typically&#160;0.5&#160;degrees for vegetation models compared to&#160;0.25&#8211;0.5&#160;km for remote sensing data, is hampering the approach. The&#160;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides higher spatial resolution (up to&#160;0.25&#160;km), delivers data for the EVI, which is calculated in the same way as NDVI, and has showed a&#160;robust approach to estimate spatial patterns of global annual primary productivity (Shi et al. 2017; Testa et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="569.18" top="171.62"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 171.62; y1: 181.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="171.62" x1="569.18">Another approach to disentangle the effects of climate and land use/management is to use the Rain Use Ef&#64257;ciency (RUE), de&#64257;ned as the biomass production per unit of rainfall, as an indicator (Le Houerou 1984; Prince et al. 1998; Fensholt et al. 2015). A&#160;variant of the RUE approach is the residual trend (RESTREND) of a&#160;NDVI time series, de&#64257;ned as the fraction of the difference between the observed NDVI and the NDVI predicted from climate data (Yengoh et al. 2015; John et al. 2016). These two metrics aim to estimate the NPP, rainfall and the time dimensions. They are simple transformations of the same three variables: RUE shows the NPP relationship with rainfall </span></div></body></html>
