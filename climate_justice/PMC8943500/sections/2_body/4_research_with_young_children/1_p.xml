The qualitative case-study reported here by Jane Spiteri makes a welcome contribution to research. Spiteri explores young Maltese children&#8217;s (aged 3&#8211;7&#160;years) perceptions of how ES can be achieved, using child friendly methods, such as semi-structured interviews with children, children&#8217;s drawings, and their own interpretations of them. Children express thoughts about caring for the natural environment, also about the connectedness between sustainability and religion, here exemplified with Catholicism. As shown earlier, these children also reach out towards the future, and provide ideas towards achieving long-term ES.</p>
