Climate change risks is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of current hazards, an increased probability of extreme events, spur the emergence of new hazards and vulnerabilities with differential spatial and socio-economic impacts. This is expected to further degrade the resilience and coping capacities of poor and vulnerable communities. Delhi has reason to be concerned about Climate Change, as we witness increased frequency of hot days, air quality levels exceeding the maximum limits, warm spells exacerbate urban heat island effects, causing heat-related health problems, as well as an increase in energy demand for warm season. A threat such as climate change thus calls for timely and tangible policy response and action that will help reduce vulnerability and build resilience of the State to likely climate impacts. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.97" top="543.81"><span x0="72.02" y0="543.81" x1="507.97" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.77; y0: 543.81; y1: 554.85; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Government of India issued the NAPCC to address the challenges of climate change on June 30, 2008 and in the year 2009 the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change called upon the Indian states to prepare SAPCCs consistent with the strategy outlined in the NAPCC. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="507.76" top="485.61"><span x0="72.02" y0="485.61" x1="507.76" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.99; y0: 485.61; y1: 496.65; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times New Roman;">Delhi SAPCC has been prepared with great efforts from all of the concerned department of Government of NCT of Delhi.
