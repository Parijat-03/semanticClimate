<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para0005">The impact of climate crises is being felt throughout the Americas and immediate responses are required. The greenhouse emissions are higher than ever in Brazil due to the increase in wildfires, deforestation, and unsustainable agriculture. Urgent actions such as forest conservation, renewable energy supply, and sustainable and efficient agriculture methods are needed. The US climate status is not much better than Brazil. After leaving the Paris Agreement for 4 years, the USA is now facing many challenges and will need to step up. One of the President&#180;s target is to cut down greenhouse emissions by 50&#8211;52% by 2030. However, promises in themselves are not enough: each country should be held accountable for the outcomes of their climate responses, as the examples cited above are consequences of years of negligence.</p>
