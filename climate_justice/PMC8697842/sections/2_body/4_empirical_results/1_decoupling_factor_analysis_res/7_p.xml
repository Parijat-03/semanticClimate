In 18 of 27 periods between 1990 and 2017, a decoupling was observed between the country&#8217;s real income and ecological footprint. From 1990 to 1994, 1998 to 2001, and 2011 to 2015, consecutive decoupling occurred between the aforementioned variables. In 9 of 27 periods, however, re-coupling was observed between ecological footprint and real income. The decoupling between ecological footprint and real income was more modest than the decoupling between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income.
