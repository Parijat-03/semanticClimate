The process of European colonization to which the book devotes a chapter is implicated in a deeper process of expropriation and denial of life than the book currently accounts for. The task of uncovering this process must incorporate struggles around social reproduction, work and everyday life, and must take seriously the idea that human life forms cannot be held as ontologically separate from all planetary life. When we incorporate a deeper analysis, in which corporations deny the possibility for social reproduction, and for all human and non-human forms of life to flourish, then &#8220;kill the corporation before it kills life itself&#8221; might be a more apt title for the next edition. That is, if we have not managed to kill the corporation before then.</p>
