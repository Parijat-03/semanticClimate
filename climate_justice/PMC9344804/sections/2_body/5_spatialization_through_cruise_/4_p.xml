In general, the pace at which tourists move through the city and the velocity with which they consume and appropriate its spaces seem to interfere with the rhythm of everyday life. This is reflected in publications like &#8220;When in Venice Walk in Single File: instructions for use of the city&#8221; (Berger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>), which provide visitors with instructions for moving around and actually experiencing it. Cruise tourism amplifies the sensation of a different pace through the concentration of large numbers of people in limited areas for brief periods of time. The flow of people that a&#160;docking cruise ship sets in motion differs significantly from that of any other form of tourism, yet their rhythm influences that of the inhabitants considerably. This externally determined timing leads to friction: &#8220;When relations of power overcome relations of alliance, when rhythms &#8216;of the other&#8217; make rhythms &#8216;of the self&#8217; impossible, then total crisis breaks out, with the deregulation of all compromises&#8221; (Lefebvre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>: 99). This fact is also present in the forms of action taken by the protest network, where the rhythm of the body is vividly represented.</p>
