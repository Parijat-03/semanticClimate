<bold>Individual Climate Action</bold> was measured using a five-item scale to assess sustainable behavior used in the original validation study of the Climate Change Anxiety scale (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Sample items included, &#8220;I recycle&#8221; and &#8220;I feel guilty if I waste energy.&#8221; This scale was developed with the Climate Change Anxiety scale and was based loosely on the Drive for Muscularity Scale, with the goal of looking at behavior that was motivated by anxiety or emotions (McCreary &amp; Sasse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000</xref>). Factor analysis distinguished this scale from the anxiety related items in the Climate Change Anxiety scale, and it was labeled Behavioral Engagement. Since items focused only on individual behavior to address climate change, in the current study we refer to this scale as Individual Climate Action to differentiate it from the collective actions measured in the Climate Activism scale. Responses were reported using a Likert scale, with response options ranging from 1&#8201;=&#8201;Disagree completely to 5&#8201;=&#8201;Agree completely. Mean scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating higher levels of engagement in individual climate action. Reliability in the current sample was acceptable (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.68).</p>
