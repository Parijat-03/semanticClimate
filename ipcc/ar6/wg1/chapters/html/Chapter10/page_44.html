Studies comparing convection-permitting RCM simulations to simulations of climate models with parametrized convection find, depending on the considered models, regions and seasons, either similar or qualitatively different projected changes in short duration extreme precipitation (Chan et&#160;al., 2014a, b, 2020; Ban et&#160;al., 2015; Tabari et&#160;al., 2016; Fosser et&#160;al., 2017; Kendon et&#160;al., 2017, 2019; Vanden Broucke et&#160;al., 2018). Process studies provide evidence that convection-permitting simulations better represent crucial local and mesoscale features of convective storms and thus simulate more plausible changes (Meredith et&#160;al., 2015a; Prein et&#160;al., 2017; Fitzpatrick et&#160;al., 2020), but further research is required to confirm and reconcile the different&#160;findings.</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.76" top="510.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="510.6" x1="298.76" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 54.96; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Studies assessing the fitness of statistical approaches for regional climate projections are still very limited in number. For statistical downscaling, a&#160;key issue is to include predictors that control long-term changes in regional climate. Models differing only in the choice of predictors may perform similarly in the present climate, but may project opposite precipitation changes (Fu et&#160;al., 2018; Manzanas et&#160;al., 2020). In addition to trend-evaluation studies (Section&#160;10.3.3.8), perfect-model experiments (Section&#160;10.3.2.5) have been used to assess whether a&#160;given model structure with a&#160;chosen set of predictors is capable of reproducing the simulated future climates (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2013; R&#228;ty et&#160;al., 2014; Dayon et&#160;al., 2015; Dixon et&#160;al., 2016; San-Mart&#237;n et&#160;al., 2017). Importantly, it is found that standard analogue methods inherently underestimate future warming trends because of missing analogues for a&#160;warmer climate (Guti&#233;rrez et&#160;al., 2013). </span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.8" top="330.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="330.6" x1="298.8" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 55.67; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Bias adjustment assumes that model biases are time invariant (or&#160;more precisely, independent of the climate state), such that the adjustment made to present climate simulations is still applicable to future climate simulations. Many findings challenge the validity of this assumption, as already assessed in AR5 (Flato et&#160;al., 2014). Further research has addressed this issue by means of perfect model experiments (Section&#160;10.3.2.5) and process understanding. Perfect-model studies with GCMs found that circulation, energy, and water-cycle biases are roughly state-independent (Krinner and Flanner, 2018), whereas temperature biases depend linearly on temperature (Kerkhoff et&#160;al., 2014). Others show that regional temperature biases may depend on soil moisture and albedo, and may thus be state-dependent (Maraun, 2012; Bellprat et&#160;al., 2013; Maraun et&#160;al., 2017; see Cross-Chapter Box&#160;10.2 for further limitations of bias adjustment). The fitness of weather generators for future projections depends on whether they account for all relevant changes in their parameters, either by predictors or change factors (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b).</span></div><div left="50.74" right="298.79" top="102.6"><span x0="50.74" y0="102.6" x1="298.79" style="x0: 50.74; x1: 53.04; y0: 102.6; y1: 112.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In any case, the fitness of regional climate projections based on dynamical downscaling or statistical approaches depends on the fitness of the driving models in projecting boundary conditions, predictors and change factors (Hall, 2014; Maraun and Widmann,&#160;2018b).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.32" top="714.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="714.6" x1="557.32" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 311.9; y0: 714.6; y1: 724.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">for projections applying process-based evaluation, process-based plausibility checks of projections and a&#160;comparison of different model types, increases the confidence in climate projections.

However, global models can show a&#160;variety of biases in, for instance, precipitation and temperature at scales ranging from continental (Prasanna, 2016) to sub-continental scales (Lovino et&#160;al., 2018), both in the mean and in higher order moments of the climatological distribution of the variable (Figure&#160;10.6; Ren et&#160;al., 2019; Xin et&#160;al., 2020). Regional biases could occur even if all the relevant large-scale processes are correctly represented, but not their interaction with regional features such as orography or land&#8211;sea contrasts (Section&#160;10.3.3.4). These biases have been considered an important limiting factor in model usability, especially at the regional scale (Palmer, 2016). In&#160;spite of this, global model simulations have been extensively used to create regional estimates of climate change (Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas), taking into account the result of a&#160;performance assessment (Chapter&#160;11, Sections 10.3.3.3&#8211;10.3.3.8, and Atlas; Jiang et&#160;al., 2020). However, their application is limited in part by the effective resolution of these models (Klaver et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.29" top="342.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="342.6" x1="557.29" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 315.07; y0: 342.6; y1: 352.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Global model performance at the regional scale is assessed in terms of the time or spatial averages of key variables (see Atlas; Brunner et&#160;al., 2019), the ability to reproduce their seasonal cycle (Hasson et&#160;al.,&#160;2013) or a&#160;set of extreme climate indicators (Chapter&#160;11; Luo et&#160;al., 2020) and the representation of regional processes and phenomena, feedbacks, drivers and forcing impacts (Sections&#160;10.3.3.4&#8211;10.3.3.6). In many cases, the performance estimates have been used to select models for either an application or a&#160;more in-depth study (Lovino et&#160;al., 2018), to select the models that provide boundary conditions to perform RCM simulations (McSweeney et&#160;al., 2015) or to weight the results of the global model simulations (Sanderson et&#160;al., 2015; Brunner et&#160;al., 2020). While some large-scale metrics are improved between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiments (Chapter&#160;3; Cannon, 2020), there is not yet concluding evidence of a&#160;systematic improvement for surface variables at the regional scale.</span></div><div left="309.26" right="557.3" top="138.6"><span x0="309.26" y0="138.6" x1="557.3" style="x0: 309.26; x1: 313.48; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The special class of high-resolution global models (Sections 1.5.3.1 and 10.3.3.1, Chapter&#160;3; Haarsma et&#160;al., 2016; Prodhomme et&#160;al., 2016) is expected to improve some of the regional processes that are not appropriately represented in standard global models (Roberts et&#160;al., 2018).
