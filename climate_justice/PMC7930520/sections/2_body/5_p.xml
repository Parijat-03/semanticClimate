Chapter 5 explores the &#8216;discovery&#8217; of juvenile delinquency following the world wars of 1914&#8211;1918 and 1939&#8211;1945 and the alarm about the &#8216;degeneration of &#8220;the (white) race&#8221;&#8217; when young women did not take up conventional roles as &#8216;good mothers, devoted wives and home-makers&#8217; (p. 149) with the post-war boom of the 1950s. Chapter 5 explores the particular case of &#8216;widgies&#8217; in 1950s Australia: girls who accompanied &#8216;bodgies&#8217;&#8212;a youth subculture that was &#8216;the Australian equivalent of an American &#8220;zoot-suiter&#8221; or an English &#8220;Teddy boy&#8221;&#8217; (p. 122). For Bessant, the case of the bodgies and widgies in the 1950s &#8216;highlights the <italic>gap</italic> that exists between how young people have been represented and what they were actually doing, their lived experience, or how they interpreted their actions and the world around them&#8217; (p. 126, Bessant&#8217;s emphasis). Bessant insightfully demonstrates the ways in which the widgies were constituted as deviant (from gender norms), and as invisible (in comparison to the prominent representation of male &#8216;bodgies&#8217;) through their representation in Australian press reporting, &#8216;expert&#8217; representation of &#8216;juvenile delinquency&#8217; and &#8216;maladjustment&#8217; by the &#8216;eugenicist psychological network&#8217; (p. 137), and interview accounts of self-identified &#8216;widgies&#8217; in the 1990s. Bessant persuasively argues that reductive interpretations and representations of the widgies served to obfuscate &#8216;the deeply political nature&#8217; of the widgies&#8217; dress, deportment and sexuality and their challenges to &#8216;a hegemonic, gendered symbolic order&#8217; and &#8216;fields of gendered power&#8217; (p. 150).</p>
