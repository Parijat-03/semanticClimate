<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par46">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the lake level duration curves for estimated 2 years for the three acceptable non-stationary models (AMS<sub>1</sub>, AMS<sub>2</sub>, and AMS<sub>3</sub>). Based on the Weibull plotting position (Vogel and Fennessey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">1994</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1995</xref>), these are compared with the corresponding stationary model (AMS<sub>0</sub>) (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.5 non-exceedance or the median and 100-year quantiles <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.99 non-exceedance) and the actual AMS series. In the figures, high lake levels have low exceedance probabilities in a particular year whereas low lake levels have high exceedance probabilities. Under stationary conditions, the T = 2-year and 100-year lake levels are estimated at 475.41&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.21 m ASVD and 477.13&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.50 m ASVD, respectively, as shown by the horizontal dashed lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a and b</xref>. These have constant values with fixed exceedance probabilities (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.5,&#8194;<italic>T</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;Year, and <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.01, <italic>T</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;100&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;Year). Under non-stationary conditions, considerable magnitude changes can be seen in the variations of both modeled T = 2-year and 100-year lake levels. All three models agree in quantile changes from the rare high lake levels, to the more common lower lake levels for both return periods, with magnitude changes from a maximum of 476.3 m ASVD (AMS<sub>2</sub>) to a minimum of 474.7 m ASVD (AMS<sub>3</sub>). The minimum is approximately equal to the annual mean lake level.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Lake level duration curves of AMS series, AMS0, and the best non-stationary models. <bold>a</bold> With T = 2 years return period and <bold>b</bold> T = 100 years return period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2020_8519_Fig10_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p>
