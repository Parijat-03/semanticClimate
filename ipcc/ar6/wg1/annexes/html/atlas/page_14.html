Although the ultimate source of these datasets is surface station reported values (GPCP and EWEMBI 4 also include satellite and reanalysis information, respectively), each has access to different numbers of 5 stations and lengths of records and employs different ways of creating the gridded product and ensuring 6 quality control.  7 8 The most widely used SST datasets are HadSST3 (Kennedy et al., 2011b, 2011a), ERSST (Huang et al., 9 2017a), and KaplanSST (Kaplan et al., 1998). The largest difference among the three datasets lie in how 10 inconsistency in number of observations during early and recent years is treated.  11 12 For example, Figure Atlas.7: shows the spatial coverage of the total number of observation stations for, 13 respectively, 1901&#8211;1910, 1971&#8211;1980, and 2001&#8211;2010 and illustrates spatially the declining trend of 14 observation station data used in the precipitation dataset for certain regions (South America, Africa) after the 15 1990s in the CRU TS4.0 dataset (left) and the SST data in the HadSST3 (right). This demonstrates the 16 regional inhomogeneity and temporal change in station density. During early years a limited number of 17 observations are available.  18 19 20 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.35; y0: 519.77; y1: 530.75; width: 3.65; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="519.77" x1="210.41">[START Figure Atlas.7: HERE] </span><span x0="27.66" y0="519.77" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 519.77; y1: 530.75; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">21 22 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 62.82; y0: 495.68; y1: 505.7; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHDAM+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;" x0="56.7" y0="495.68" x1="123.38">Figure Atlas.7: </span><span x0="127.62" y0="495.68" x1="526.81" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 133.74; y0: 495.68; y1: 505.7; width: 6.12; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Left: Number of stations per 0.5 x 0.5 grid cell reported over the period of 1901&#8211;1910, 1971&#8211;1980, </span><span x0="27.66" y0="495.47" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 495.47; y1: 506.45; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="484.16" x1="506.55" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.07; y0: 484.16; y1: 494.18; width: 4.45; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">and 2001&#8211;2010 (top 1-3) and global total number of stations reported over the entire globe for </span><span x0="27.66" y0="483.95" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 483.95; y1: 494.93; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">24 </span><span x0="127.62" y0="472.7" x1="511.92" style="x0: 127.62; x1: 132.63; y0: 472.7; y1: 482.72; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">precipitation for CRU TS4.0 dataset (bottom).

The 30 advantage of satellite-based rainfall products is their globally uniform coverage including remote areas. 31 However, there have been reported inconsistencies among different satellite-based rainfall products over 32 complex terrain (Rahmawati and Lubczynski, 2018; Satg&#233; et al., 2019). Another recent development has 33 been on gridded dataset for climate extremes based on surface stations.   34 35 36 </span><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 63.41; y0: 320.81; y1: 331.79; width: 6.71; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHDCA+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;" x0="56.7" y0="320.81" x1="336.36">Atlas.3.1.1 Consistency and differences in observational data </span><span x0="27.66" y0="320.81" x1="41.44" style="x0: 27.66; x1: 33.15; y0: 320.81; y1: 331.79; width: 5.49; font-size: 10.98; font-family: JEHCPK+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">37 38 There are some recent studies assessing observational datasets globally (Beck et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018b) 39 that report large differences among them. Regional studies have also been undertaken on comparing and 40 assessing observational datasets with similar results (Manzanas et al., 2014; Salio et al., 2015; Prakash, 41 2019), thus stressing the importance of considering observational uncertainty in regional climate assessment 42 studies. For example, Indasi (2019) assessed rainfall characteristics of ten gridded precipitation datasets over 43 Southern Africa (Table Atlas.2:). They demonstrated that those sharing similar source data displayed similar 44 rainfall characteristics while station-based datasets showed the least similarities. No single dataset was found 45 to capture the rainfall characteristics across the entire Southern Africa region, and each performed better or 46 worse depending on location. They also noted the decline in the number of stations available, mainly due to 47 insufficient resources but also a tendency by country meteorological services to restrict free access, 48 increasing relevance of satellite data and significant relationships between some of the datasets (Figure 49 Atlas.8:). Another important aspect is that many stations do not report to the WMO networks, with their data 50 being kept domestically or regionally, which has made regional datasets become more important in the 51 recent years. 52 53 54 55 </span></div></body></html>
