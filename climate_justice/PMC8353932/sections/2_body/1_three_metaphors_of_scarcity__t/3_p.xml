Nerlich and Jaspal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>) argue that metaphors are <italic>linguistic technology</italic>, a tool we use to think and act with. The three metaphors discussed below are scientific concepts that were developed to summarise knowledge relevant to global temperature change. I call them scientific <italic>metaphors</italic> because they fulfil a metaphorical function to help people &#8216;see&#8217; at what point climate change will enter dangerous territory and &#8216;know&#8217; how close we are to that point. And these metaphors would generate the recognition of <italic>scarcity</italic> that (too) little space and time is left to stay within the physical limit for avoiding the dangerous consequences of climate change.</p>
