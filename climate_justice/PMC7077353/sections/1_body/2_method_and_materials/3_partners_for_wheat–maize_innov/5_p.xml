<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Table A2 (Online Appendix) shows the actual percentages of farmers trained in wheat&#8211;maize innovations directly through the RDRS and through the Kalipara Union Federation. It shows that more Muslim/Hindu women (14.7% of all trainees) were trained than Santal women (12% of all trainees), although Santal women are more numerous in the membership (55%) than Muslim/Hindu women (38%). It further shows that 270 Muslim/Hindu men were trained directly by RDRS (72% of all trainees) and that only five Santal men (1.3% of all trainees) were trained (through the Union Federation). It appears that joining the Union Federation is the only way for Santal men to put themselves forward for potential targeting for wheat&#8211;maize training events. They are not targeted directly by RDRS unlike middle to high-income Hindu/Muslim men. This is presumably because all Santal men fall into the marginalised/low-income category. It would further appear that no low-income Muslim/Hindu men are targeted.</p>
