<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While our study covers a robust set of metropolitan areas over a large geographic region, other cities within the U.S. or elsewhere may show somewhat different patterns. More research is needed to fully develop an understanding of neighborhood-scale thermal disparities within urban regions globally. Additionally, the satellite imagery used here, as in the large majority of urban heat studies, measures surface temperatures rather than ambient air temperatures. The latter is most relevant to human comfort and health, but must typically be measured in situ or estimated through modeling. Such techniques are difficult over large metropolitan areas. Finally, the demographics explored here are only a small subsection of the demographics that are potentially at risk for unequal exposure to heat. Other variables of potential interest to future investigators include education, age, disability, citizenship, median housing value, and percentage of single-parent households.</p>
