      <td>Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought events (high confidence). Greater\nwarming over land than over the ocean alters atmospheric circulation patterns and reduces continental near-surface relative humidity,\nwhich contributes to regional drying (high confidence). A very likely decrease in relative humidity has occurred over much of the global\nland area since 2000. Projected increases in evapotranspiration due to growing atmospheric water demand will decrease soil moisture\nover the Mediterranean region, south-western North America, South Africa, South-Western South America and south-western Australia\n(high confidence) (Box TS.6, Figure 1). Some tropical regions are also projected to experience enhanced aridity, including the Amazon\nbasin and Central America (high confidence). The total land area subject to increasing drought frequency and severity will expand (high\nconfidence), and in the Mediterranean, South-Western South America, and Western North America, future aridification will far exceed the\nmagnitude of change seen in the last millennium (high confidence). {4.5.1, 8.2.2, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, Box 8.2, 11.6, 11.9}</td>

      <td>Land-use change and water extraction for irrigation have influenced local and regional responses in the water cycle (high confidence).\nLarge-scale deforestation likely decreases evapotranspiration and precipitation and increases runoff over the deforested regions\nrelative to the regional effects of climate change (medium confidence). Urbanization increases local precipitation (medium confidence)\nand runoff intensity (high confidence) (Box TS.14). Increased precipitation intensities have enhanced groundwater recharge, most\nnotably in tropical regions (medium confidence). There is high confidence that groundwater depletion has occurred since at least the\nstart of the 21st century, as a consequence of groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in agricultural areas in drylands. {8.2.3, 8.3.1,\n11.1.6, 11.4, 11.6, FAQ 8.1}</td>

      <td>Water cycle variability and related extremes are projected to increase faster than mean changes in most regions of the world\nand under all emissions scenarios (high confidence). A warmer climate increases moisture transport into weather systems, which\nintensifies wet seasons and events (high confidence). The magnitudes of projected precipitation increases and related extreme\nevents depend on model resolution and the representation of convective processes (high confidence). Increases in near-surface\natmospheric moisture capacity of about 7% per 1&#186;C of warming lead to a similar response in the intensification of heavy precipitation\nfrom sub-daily up to seasonal time scales, increasing the severity of flood hazards (high confidence). The average and maximum\nrain-rates associated with tropical and extratropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers and severe convective storms will therefore also\nincrease with future warming (high confidence). For some regions, there is medium confidence that peak tropical cyclone rain-\nrates will increase by more than 7% per 1&#176;C of warming due to increased low-level moisture convergence caused by increases\nin wind intensity. In the tropics year-round and in the summer season elsewhere, interannual variability of precipitation and\nrunoff over land is projected to increase at a faster rate than changes in seasonal mean precipitation (Figure TS.12e,f) (medium\nconfidence). Sub-seasonal precipitation variability is also projected to increase, with fewer rainy days but increased daily mean\nprecipitation intensity over many land regions (high confidence). {4.5.3, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 11.4, 11.5, 11.7, 11.9}</td>
