<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">All comments that include clear expressions of negative emotional responses after
interpreting the models described in the sampled predictive journalism articles
were grouped under the broad <italic toggle="yes">affective response</italic> theme. Comments
in this theme conveyed rising levels of concern about the future of the virus.
Predominantly, comments consistently expressed fear as one of the emotions
triggered by the models&#8217; depictions and forecasts of the worst-case scenario
(e.g. &#8220;the worst-case scenario [as described in the model] does nothing but
promote anxiety and fear&#8221;). Such comments were grouped into a single subtheme
named <italic toggle="yes">negative emotional response.</italic> Throughout the qualitative
analysis of the comments, we also observed a few commenters communicating other
types of emotions such as anxiety, nervousness, and frustration in response to
the models. For instance, one commenter wrote, &#8220;I don&#8217;t find articles like these
helpful; it just accelerates anxiety and panic&#8221; and another stated that &#8220;Every
evening I get into a state of fear and frustration when I come here to see the
updates [of the model].&#8221;</p>
