Parents and nonparents alike should have equal access to a range of valuable capabilities, which includes the opportunity to have children. Ann has a right to the same access to certain levels of her capabilities as Pearl has. Her decision to not use one of those capabilities does not imply that she has a right to expend the resources from the ecosystems that she did not expend on procreation and parenting on capabilities that are not available to parents. From a capability perspective, in the context of great scarcity, we owe each other access to a minimal set of valuable capabilities. Which exact capabilities would be part of that minimal set would have to be decided by a democratic process that is legitimate and can be defended on moral grounds. That process should identify a set of capabilities that everyone should have access to.</p>
