<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Negative emotions evoked by interpreting the models, as shown in the previous
examples, were also in some instances a catalyst for readers to take action.
This was evident in a comment shared by a teacher in a community college
discussing the shift to online learning due to their concern about safety: &#8220;I
work at a rural community college. These charts [referring to the model] make it
look like the entire summer, fall, and even next spring might be too unsafe,
resulting in maybe a year or more of online instruction.&#8221; In the next section,
we will further elaborate on this type of action-oriented response by focusing
on the numerous actions that were taken or demanded by the readers as expressed
in their comments.</p>
