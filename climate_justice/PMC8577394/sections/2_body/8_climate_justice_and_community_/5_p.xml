Representatives of public housing residents living on the coast, mainly women of color, prioritized flood protection from the long-term impacts of climate change and to avoid a repeat of Sandy, while older and whiter environmental activists&#160;mobilized against the plan by emphasizing their daily use of the park, the conservation of its nature (trees and animal habitats), and expected negative side-effects of construction. Both groups, however, framed their positions as informed by environmental justice concerns, as the activist groups recognized the symbolic capital associated with social justice and equity in Mayor de Blasio&#8217;s New York. The activists&#8217; emphasis on maintenance of open green space for leisure and enjoyment is reminiscent of Taylor&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>) account of the rise of the conservation movement in New York in the 18th and 19th centuries, wherein relatively well-off families pushed for more open green spaces for recreation, while worker movements advocated for health and sanitation protections from the city. The empirical reality of climate change, however, adds a temporal dimension to this old cleavage. Relatively well-off residents privilege existing open space for leisure, while residents of public housing, as we will see, prefer to emphasize the long-term health protections from flood infrastructure.</p>
