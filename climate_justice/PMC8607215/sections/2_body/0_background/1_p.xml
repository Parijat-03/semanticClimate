With simple acts of exercising, appropriate clothes, or huddling together, one will potentially overcome shivering. Yet, heat acclimatization requires cooling devices to enhance ventilation and heat loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This implies that individuals without the capacity to afford basic technologies such as fans or air-conditioning will be hit hard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With human-induced greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) increasing global warming, efforts towards mitigating these emissions are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is more disconcerting as climate modelers predict extreme temperatures and heatwaves over the next three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The time frame suggests that youth are more likely to bear the full brunt of a warming climate that is marked by stronger hurricanes, drought, and heatwaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
