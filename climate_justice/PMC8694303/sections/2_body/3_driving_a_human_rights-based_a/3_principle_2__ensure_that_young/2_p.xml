<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Acknowledging the requests of young people, governments should ensure that girls, women and those belonging to marginalized groups&#8212;including people of color, indigenous people, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ people&#8212;have equal opportunities to participate in climate change policymaking. Media outlets should also make sure these groups are given equitable visibility in the media. Policy makers, researchers, and journalists should examine and report on the efforts of young people belonging to marginalized groups. Additionally, the voice of future generations should be included by engaging children as much as possible in events and programs.</p>
