Lao PDR, Lesotho, and the Solomon Islands require legislation to strengthen mitigation and adaptation initiatives and integrate (N4.1) them into their development plans. Chad, Burundi, and Guinea Bissau need assistance in institutionalizing a sector-wise (N5.3) adaptation plan to safeguard natural resources.
