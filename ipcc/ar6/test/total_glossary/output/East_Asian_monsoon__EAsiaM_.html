<p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0" style="font-weight: bold">The East Asian monsoon (EAsiaM) is the seasonal reversal in wind and precipitation occurring over East Asia, including eastern China, Japan and the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>In contrast to the other monsoons it extends quite far north, out of the tropical belt, and it is largely influenced by subtropical systems and by disturbances from the mid-latitudes. The EAsiaM manifests during boreal summer with warm and wet southerly winds, but also during boreal winter with cold and dry northerly winds. In late April/early May, rainfall onsets in the central Indochina Peninsula, and in mid-June the rainy season arrives over East Asia with the formation of the Meiyu front along the Yangtze River valley, Changma in Korea and Baiu in Japan. In July, the monsoon advances up to North China, the Korean peninsula and central Japan. During boreal winter, strong north-westerlies manifest over north and north-east China, Korea and Japan, while strong north-easterlies arrive along the coast of East Asia. Further details on how EAsiaM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p>
