<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0420">The role of agricultural trade in resilience building efforts should be considered in terms of exposure to a variety of economic and environmental risks. The pandemic and global lockdown exerted mainly a demand shock on agricultural trade as discussed earlier. Other risks, such as climatic extremes or pest outbreaks or crop and livestock diseases, may lead to supply shocks. Trade may also be an important factor in managing long-term changes. International trade can help buffer agricultural productivity and food security of regions against the impacts of climate change (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Janssens et al., 2020</xref>). Given the multitude of global risks and compounding local risks that food systems are exposed to, greater emphasis should be placed on assessing the capacity of existing supply chains and trade patterns to withstand or adapt to a variety of shocks. Looking at the situation of West Africa, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al. (2020)</xref> note the potential risks to food security associated with long supply chains if protectionist measures are implemented, while also recognizing the need for a balanced approach to trade in order to manage diverse portfolio of challenges to food security in the region. In general, specific attention should be given to the extent to which the current system benefits the most vulnerable countries and where the global trade system needs to be complemented by market regional integration or a strengthening of regional self-sufficiency.</p>
