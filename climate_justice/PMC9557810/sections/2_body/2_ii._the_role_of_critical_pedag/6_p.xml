<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Although Freirean critical pedagogy has its roots in rural peasant movements in
Brazil, it has long been embraced by, and expanded into, urban realities as well as
more intersectional and feminist perspectives on popular struggles. Black,
Indigenous and feminist scholars, in this context, have brought forward notions of
the oppressed in relation to structural racism and patriarchal
domination.<sup>(<xref rid="fn15-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">15</xref>)</sup> Freire&#8217;s foundational work<sup>(<xref rid="fn16-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">16</xref>)</sup> in critical pedagogy
emphasized the dialogical relation between theory and praxis, as well as the
importance of giving this praxis a direction towards change for social justice,
nurtured by iterative and deep processes of reflexion. His conceptualization of
critical pedagogy as freedom through learning benefited over the years from
contributions from postmodern, feminist, postcolonial and queer theories and,
perhaps most importantly, has continued to be a central practice of social movements
and organized civil society.</p>
