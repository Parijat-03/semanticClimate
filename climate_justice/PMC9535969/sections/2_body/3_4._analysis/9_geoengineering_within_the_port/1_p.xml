(TSNC &#8211; Group III)</p><p>Here in Portugal, we see the issue of lithium. Car batteries have lithium (.&#8196;.&#8196;.). We are reducing carbon dioxide emissions at the cost of destroying natural and archaeological heritage, and ecosystems. This also happens with solar panels that contain lead. (BE &#8211; Group VI)</p><p>It&#8217;s a bit like what was done in Portugal with the dams (.&#8196;.&#8196;.) nobody remembers that 70% of [renewable energies] is from dams that destroyed countless ecosystems, that caused a drastic decline in the water quality in all the rivers.
