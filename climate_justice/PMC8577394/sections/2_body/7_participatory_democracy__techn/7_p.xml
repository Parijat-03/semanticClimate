McQuarrie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>), for example, proposed that government officials in American cities have progressively narrowed the scope of what is up for discussion in participatory forums since the 1970s as part of a neoliberalizing reform of governance in urban areas, and so residents are relegated to deliberate on issues that are largely inconsequential to substantial distribution of resources in urban neighborhoods. More recently, Levine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>) argued that government officials purposefully exploit the vague definition of &#8220;the community&#8221; to give residents the appearance of empowerment while retaining ultimate decision-making authority. City officials, in Levine&#8217;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>) account, put decision-making in hands of &#8220;the community,&#8221; but &#8220;the community&#8221; could mean a number of things, including land developers themselves, if for example, members of the development team live in the neighborhood. Both are accounts of elite authority sidestepping democratic decision-making to restrict the flow of funds to poor neighborhoods or to benefit real estate developers. Neither explanation emphasizes the role of technical experts in producing or legitimizing these decisions.</p>
