Burby et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>) found that low-income households make up two-thirds of the entire renting population in the USA. Furthermore, in a study of 51 communities in Nebraska, Paine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>) found that renters made up over 50% of properties. Similar results have been found for other communities like King County, WA, where a look at environmental justice revealed that the majority of the renters in the floodplain were non-white (Paine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2019</xref>).</p>
