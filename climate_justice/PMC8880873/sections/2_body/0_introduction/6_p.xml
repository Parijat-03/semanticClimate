<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our results suggest that the technical potential does <italic toggle="yes">not have</italic> a statistically significant association with tribes&#8217; installed wind capacity. This is both good news and bad news. On the one hand, it shows how Native American tribes have yet to convert the technical potential into a viable economic asset. This is worrisome given both economic poverty and energy poverty in many Native nations [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an issue observed in other countries as well [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the positive side, it suggests that a stronger policy push and incentives for decarbonization could create substantial economic benefits for tribes. Because wind is not an exhaustible resource (unlike, say coal mines) and does not cause local air pollution, renewable energy generation could provide a sustained income stream to Native Nations. And when renewable energy replaces fossil fuel capacity, as in the case of the Navajo Nation, it could create local health benefits of cleaner air.</p>
