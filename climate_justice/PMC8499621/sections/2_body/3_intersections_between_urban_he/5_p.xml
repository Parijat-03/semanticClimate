<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There is increasing evidence of biologically plausible explanations of associations between urban environmental exposures and mental health. These include the effects of traffic and air population exposure on neurodevelopmental pathways in children,<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> neuroinflammation across the life course,<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and changes in arousal and stress responses associated with time spent in green space.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Proposed mechanisms through which the green space's benefits may be manifest include a shift in attention, promoting curiosity, social networks, group cooperation and physical activity. However, methodological and interpretation challenges remain, for example, in understanding the importance of confounding factors such as noise pollution and general neighbourhood deprivation.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Limited studies have translated these observations into robust evidence for improved mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
