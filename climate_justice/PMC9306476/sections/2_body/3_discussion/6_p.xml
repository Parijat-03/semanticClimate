<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One concept that is very pertinent for institutions working in global health and education is climate justice [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Given that the negative impacts of climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, those living in low&#8208;income settings and young people, institutions working in global health and education should integrate the principles of climate justice into the organisational sustainability agenda. For example, global health research institutions in HICs with close working partnerships with counterparts in LMICs should make efforts to be a partner on sustainable approaches. One example of this is the solar power installation at the MRC Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Institutions with education missions should include training on skills suitable for the green economy into internal training programmes and outreach activities [<xref rid="tmi13714-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
