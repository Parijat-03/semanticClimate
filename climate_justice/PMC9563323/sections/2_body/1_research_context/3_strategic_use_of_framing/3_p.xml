<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">All of these findings align with research in cognitive linguistics, which broadly agrees on a view of linguistic negation of any kind as having a fundamentally foregrounding effect (see <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo Downing [2000]</xref> for a useful overview). <xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">Giv&#243;n (1993)</xref> explains that this is because negation essentially reverses the normative means through which human beings understand stasis as a conceptual background, against which descriptions of events or change stand out in our minds. Giv&#243;n points out that there is a predominance of language in everyday communication which fits this standard conceptual structure: events are construed through language as more informative than non-events. This predominance also affects how we perceive departures from it made through negation, where the event, rather than inertia, is established as the ground and a non-event becomes more salient and more informative (<xref rid="j_jwl-2022-0017_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">Giv&#243;n 1993</xref>: 190). When negation is used in language, therefore, it is discoursally and conceptually deviant, drawing attention both to itself as a linguistic form and to the non-events it describes.</p>
