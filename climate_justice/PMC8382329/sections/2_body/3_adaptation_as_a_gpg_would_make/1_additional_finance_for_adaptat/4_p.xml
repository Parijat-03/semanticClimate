Actually, it does not matter whether additional money is mobilized domestically or internationally, because the internalization of externalities, even cross-border ones, begins at home. Essentially, GPGs amount to national public goods plus international cooperation. Given growing pressure globally at public, civil society, and development agency levels, any future possibility of mobilizing extra-budgetary resources cannot be ruled out. Pittel and R&#252;bbelke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2013</xref>rightly argue that enhanced adaptation finance may induce developing countries to undertake more mitigation, which is a universally agreed GPG and is the ultimate solution to climate change. Large-scale mitigation investments could significantly limit the costs of global adaptation.</p>
