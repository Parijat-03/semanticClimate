This is urgently needed to inform policy action in these contexts. In LMIC contexts, forced migration due to climate change &#8211; with the destination locations often being cities &#8211; is a significant challenge, and studies have highlighted that dislocation from one's home compromises emotional well-being related to happiness, life satisfaction, optimism for the future and spiritual contentment, even despite well-intentioned relocation programmes focused on material compensation and livelihood re-establishment.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
