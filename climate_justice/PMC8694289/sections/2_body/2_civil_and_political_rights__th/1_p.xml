The Limburg Principles state that &#8220;a concerted national effort to invoke the full participation of all sectors of society is, therefore, indispensable to achieving progress in realizing economic, social and cultural rights. Popular participation is required at all stages, including the formulation, application and review of national policies.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
