By linking the above keywords together, we define climate-smart agriculture as a &#8220;transformative and sustainable kind of agriculture that tries to increase efficiency (productivity) in food security and production systems, using a combination of the pillars of climate change (adaptation, resilience, and mitigation) as well as smart and new technological knowledge, that do not only build capacity of farmers&#8217; in terms of farming techniques, but also increase profit, reduces vulnerability of the systems as well as their results (farm products/animals), through the reduction of GHG emissions.&#8221; </p>
