Any organisation wanting to emit more than the amount of permits they possess must purchase permits from others who no longer require them because they have reduced their emissions. Some schemes allow trading of permits with those from other schemes and some require permits to remain within the scheme. One of the more contentious issues is that some schemes allow the purchasing of offsets through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) administered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>). The CDM allows polluting firms to invest in clean technology (usually in the Global South) to earn Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) which can then be used in place of permits in an ETS (usually only up to a defined level). Similar voluntary investments are also possible, that cannot be used in an ETS but nevertheless allow companies to claim to be carbon neutral (B&#246;hm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>).</p>
