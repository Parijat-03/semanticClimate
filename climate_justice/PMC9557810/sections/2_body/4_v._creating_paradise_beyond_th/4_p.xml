the links between them. Emancipatory pedagogies, for example, have been fundamental
in making visible, revalorizing and seeking a social redistribution of the roles of
women as carers, particularly pertinent in pandemic times. The experiential
pedagogies in Medell&#237;n were critical for people with physical disabilities to break
away from their isolation in the hillsides of the city, towards actualizing their
rights and opportunities in the city. In terms of reciprocal recognition, the
practices of <italic toggle="yes">sentipensar</italic> in particular provoke profound reflections
not only on the question of what and whose knowledge counts in habitat struggles,
but how relations between different knowledges, feelings and practices &#8211;
professional, embodied, experiential and others &#8211; are constructed and enacted.
Importantly, the pedagogic practices of mobilization and reverberation remind us of
the strategic trajectory and political weight of HIC schools in Latin America to
advance towards a socially just habitat. For example, FUCVAM&#8217;s intergenerational
pedagogies are not static practices, but have responded to the Federation&#8217;s changing
relations to the state over time &#8211; building capacities to act in the absence of,
against, or with government institutions depending on their (legal) support for
cooperative housing models. Finally, the schools have been fertile grounds for
learning and acting in solidarity, as witnessed through their provoking of
alternative economic, cultural and environmental models and imaginaries of
