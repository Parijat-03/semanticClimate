Evidence is scarce, however, on both the effects of climate change on adolescents and effective interventions to be taken by health professionals to protect any age group.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> To implement the most appropriate climate interventions, it is crucial that health professionals support the surveillance, analysis, and reporting of the climate sensitive burden of disease on adolescents, while being aware of other factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, history of exploitation, and geographical location. Furthermore, more evidence is needed for those interventions which might protect adolescent wellbeing in climate related conflict and disaster settings, and for adolescents experiencing climate related migration.</p>
