In the 2000s, the GPG debate was supported by the EU, while Japan and the USA opposed it. The central issue was the question of additionality of finance, above ODA. Developing countries feared ODA diversion into the provisioning of GPGs, and how their governance was undemocratic (Carbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). The EU continues to support contributions based on ability to pay (i.e., GDP) and responsibility for GHG emissions (EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). Sweden and France, regarded as pioneers in GPG promotion, established an International Task Force on GPGs in 2003. The Task Force defined GPGs as issues that are considered important to the global community, which must be addressed collectively (cited in Carbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). The Task Force identified among others tackling climate change as a GPG. The study included strategies such as strengthening adaptive capacity in developing countries. As negotiators under the UNFCCC, the authors testifies that capacity building as a GPG is not contested, discussed under Article 11 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
