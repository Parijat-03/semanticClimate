<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Utilizing Google Earth Engine (GEE), we downloaded Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Tier 1 imagery. Tier 1 is in a scaled digital number format (often described in the literature as a raw scene). Using JavaScript-enabled GEE we processed these data to obtain at-sensor (or top-of-atmosphere (TOA)) radiance and surface reflectance. We then used TOA radiance and surface reflectance data to retrieve Land Surface Temperature LST. The geometric fidelity of the Tier 1 Landsat Collections has a root mean square error (RSME) of less than 12 m [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-00941" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We projected all imagery into WGS 1984 UTM format for the specific zone of each city. Dates were selected for cloud-free periods (which provide the most accurate readings) in the summer season.</p>
