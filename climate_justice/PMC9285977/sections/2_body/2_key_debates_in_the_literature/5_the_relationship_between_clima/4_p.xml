<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Climate change can act as a transformative force that reshapes political structures (Dodman &amp; Mitlin, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0111" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and creates new political roles for municipal authorities (McGuirk, Dowling, &amp; Bulkeley, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0204" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As Chu (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0097" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>) describes, climate adaptation politics in cities in India has produced processes through which state&#8208;society relations are re&#8208;negotiated, where communities gain new recognition as sources of agency and knowledge. However, such processes of institutional negotiation need to be situated in wider contexts of economic restructuring. For example, the shift of authority to private sector actors, alongside the contractual arrangements that have made it possible, constrains the ability of municipalities to control emissions (Monstadt, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0207" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Peterson &amp; Hughes, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0225" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
