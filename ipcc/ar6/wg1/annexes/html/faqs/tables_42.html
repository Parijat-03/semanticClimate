The interactions between clouds and the climate are complex and\nvaried. Clouds at low altitudes tend to reflect incoming solar energy back to space, creating a cooling effect by\npreventing this energy from reaching and warming the Earth. On the other hand, higher clouds tend to trap\n(i.e., absorb and then emit at a lower temperature) some of the energy leaving the Earth, leading to a warming\neffect. On average, clouds reflect back more incoming energy than the amount of outgoing energy they trap,\nresulting in an overall net cooling effect on the present climate. Human activities since the pre-industrial era\nhave altered this climate effect of clouds in two different ways: by changing the abundance of the aerosol\nparticles in the atmosphere and by warming the Earth&#8217;s surface, primarily as a result of increases in greenhouse</td>

Hence, aerosols released by human activities have\nhad a cooling effect, counteracting a considerable portion of the warming caused by increases in greenhouse\ngases over the last century (see FAQ 3.1).

This cascading effect of clouds, known as the cloud feedback, could either\namplify or offset some of the future warming and has long been the biggest source of uncertainty in climate\nprojections. The problem stems from the fact that clouds can change in many ways and that their processes occur\non much smaller scales than global climate models can explicitly represent. As a result, global climate models\nhave disagreed on how clouds, particularly over the subtropical ocean, will change in the future and whether the</td>

Also, current global climate models simulate cloud behaviour better than previous models, due both to\nadvances in computational capabilities and process understanding. Altogether, this has helped to build a more\ncomplete picture of how clouds will change as the climate warms (FAQ 7.2, Figure 1). For example, the amount\nof low-clouds will reduce over the subtropical ocean, leading to less reflection of incoming solar energy, and\nthe altitude of high-clouds will rise, making them more prone to trapping outgoing energy; both processes\nhave a warming effect. In contrast, clouds in high latitudes will be increasingly made of water droplets rather\nthan ice crystals. This shift from fewer, larger ice crystals to smaller but more numerous water droplets will\nresult in more of the incoming solar energy being reflected back to space and produce a cooling effect. Better\nunderstanding of how clouds respond to warming has led to more confidence than before that future changes\nin clouds will, overall, cause additional warming (i.e., by weakening the current cooling effect of clouds).
