In the United Kingdom, a consensus-based approach was used to provide informal standards on how clinics should develop. The United States of America relied more on a review of existing pedagogical literature that included a strong focus on the negative effects of existing legal educational practices on the emotional well-being of law students. The authors of the Australian Clinical Best Practices sought input from clinicians and other legal educators from Australia and elsewhere. They reviewed relevant literature as well as collecting data on what practices were working well in existing programmes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn66">66</xref></p>
