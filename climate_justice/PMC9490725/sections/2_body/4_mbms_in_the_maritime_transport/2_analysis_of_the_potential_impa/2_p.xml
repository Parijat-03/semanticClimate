According to Psaraftis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2021</xref>), EU ETS permits purchased by the shipping sector will be fully tradeable within the scheme like other permits. Christodoulou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>) demonstrated the differential effects on various maritime trades, whereby smaller vessels such as RoRo ferries transporting trailers would be more disadvantaged than large oil tankers with higher economies of scale, potentially leading to a reverse modal shift towards road for intra-EU container and trailer traffic. Cariou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>) found that the cost increase on shipping could be enough to incentivise energy reduction measures such as wind assistance technologies.</p>
