      <td>GMSL will continue to rise throughout the 21st century (Box TS.4, Figure 1a). Considering only those processes in whose projections\nwe have at least medium confidence, relative to the period 1995&#8211;2014, GMSL is projected to rise between 0.18 m (0.15&#8211;0.23 m,\nlikely range; SSP1-1.9) and 0.23 m (0.20&#8211;0.30 m, likely range; SSP5-8.5) by 2050. By 2100, the projected rise is between 0.38 m\n(0.28&#8211;0.55 m, likely range; SSP1-1.9) and 0.77 m (0.63&#8211;1.01 m, likely range; SSP5-8.5) {Table 9.9}. The methods, models and scenarios\nused for sea level projections in the AR6 are updated from those employed by SROCC, with contributions informed by the latest\nmodel projections described in the ocean and cryosphere Sections (Sections TS.2.4 and TS.2.5). Despite these differences, the sea level\nprojections are broadly consistent with those of SROCC. {4.3.2, 9.6.3}</td>

      <td>Importantly, likely range projections do not include those ice-sheet-related processes whose quantification is highly uncertain\nor that are characterized by deep uncertainty. Higher amounts of GMSL rise before 2100 could be caused by earlier-than-projected\ndisintegration of marine ice shelves, the abrupt, widespread onset of marine ice sheet instability (MISI) and marine ice cliff instability\n(MICI) around Antarctica, and faster-than-projected changes in the surface mass balance and dynamical ice loss from Greenland\n(Box TS.4, Figure 1). In a low-likelihood, high-impact storyline and a high CO emissions scenario, such processes could in combination\n2\ncontribute more than one additional meter of sea level rise by 2100 (Box TS.3). {4.3.2, 9.6.3, Box 9.4}</td>

      <td>Beyond 2100, GMSL will continue to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss from\nice sheets, and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). By 2150, considering only those processes in whose\nprojections we have at least medium confidence and assuming no acceleration in ice-mass flux after 2100, GMSL is projected to rise\nbetween 0.6 m (0.4&#8211;0.9 m, likely range, SSP1-1.9) and 1.3 m (1.0&#8211;1.9 m, likely range) (SSP5-8.5), relative to the period 1995&#8211;2014\nbased on the SSP scenario extensions. Under high CO emissions, processes in which there is low confidence, such as MICI, could drive\n2\nGMSL rise up to about 5 m by 2150 (Box TS.4, Figure 1a). By 2300, GMSL will rise 0.3&#8211;3.1 m under low CO emissions (SSP1-2.6) (low\n2\nconfidence). Under high CO emissions (SSP5-8.5), projected GMSL rise is between 1.7 and 6.8 m by 2300 in the absence of MICI and\n2\nby up to 16 m considering MICI (low confidence). Over 2000 years, there is medium agreement and limited evidence that committed\nGMSL rise is projected to be about 2&#8211;3 m with 1.5&#176;C peak warming, 2&#8211;6 m with 2&#176;C of peak warming, 4&#8211;10 m with 3&#176;C of peak\nwarming, 12&#8211;16 m with 4&#176;C of peak warming, and 19&#8211;22 m with 5&#176;C of peak warming. {9.6.3}</td>

      <td>Looking at uncertainty in time provides an alternative perspective on uncertainty in future sea level rise (Box TS.4, Figure 1c). For\nexample, considering only medium confidence processes, GMSL rise is likely to exceed 0.5 m between about 2080 and 2170 under\nSSP1-2.6 and between about 2070 and 2090 under SSP5-8.5. Given the long-term commitment, uncertainty in the timing of reaching\ndifferent levels of GMSL rise is an important consideration for adaptation planning. {9.6.3}</td>

      <td>At regional scales, additional processes come into play that modify the local sea level change relative to GMSL, including vertical land\nmotion, ocean circulation and density changes, and gravitational, rotational, and deformational effects arising from the redistribution\nof water and ice mass between land and the ocean. These processes give rise to a spatial pattern that tends to increase sea level\nrise at the low latitudes and reduce sea level rise at high latitudes. However, over the 21st century, the majority of coastal locations\nhave a median projected regional sea level rise within &#177;20% of the projected GMSL change (medium confidence). Further details on\nregional sea level change and extremes are provided in Section TS.4. {9.6.3}</td>

      <td>The continued growth of atmospheric CO concentrations over the industrial era is unequivocally due to emissions from\n2\nhuman activities. Ocean and land carbon sinks slow the rise of CO in the atmosphere. Projections show that while\n2\nland and ocean sinks absorb more CO under high emissions scenarios than low emissions scenarios, the fraction of\n2\nemissions removed from the atmosphere by natural sinks decreases with higher concentrations (high confidence).\nProjected ocean and land sinks show similar responses for a given scenario, but the land sink has a much higher\ninterannual variability and wider model spread. The slowed growth rates of the carbon sinks projected for the second\nhalf of this century are linked to strengthening carbon&#8211;climate feedbacks and stabilization of atmospheric CO under\n2\nmedium-to-no-mitigation and high-mitigation scenarios, respectively (see FAQ 5.1). {5.2, 5.4}</td>
