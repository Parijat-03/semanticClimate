<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Given that HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and ongoing global warming is projected to amplify extreme weather events in the region,<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> understanding associations between HIV/AIDS and extreme weather events is critical. Advancing research in this area may enable the tailoring of education and adaptation strategies.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> This study provides information that may be considered in designing HIV/AIDS prevention strategies, particularly for women, people living in rural settings, and adults older than 30 years in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
