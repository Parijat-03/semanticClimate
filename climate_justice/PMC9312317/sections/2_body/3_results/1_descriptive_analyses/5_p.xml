<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par43">Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> gives an overview of levels of agreement with the items measuring support for far-reaching, transformational climate action. On the one hand, we see widespread support for the notions that government should do what climate scientists say even if the majority of people is opposed (&#8216;Climate vs Majority&#8217; avg.&#8201;=&#8201;4.21/1&#8211;5), and that protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs (&#8216;Climate vs Growth&#8217; avg.&#8201;=&#8201;4.53/1&#8211;5). Hence, there generally appears to be strong support for far-reaching measures to tackle climate change, though a smaller percentage of respondents did clearly indicate reservations to such change. There is bigger disagreement as to whether measures to decrease CO<sup>2</sup> emissions should be allowed to make social welfare arrangements worse (&#8216;Climate vs Social security&#8217; avg.&#8201;=&#8201;3.11/1&#8211;5), which may reflect the general support for&#8212;and reluctance to compromise&#8212;social security in progressive movements and particularly support for a &#8216;just transition&#8217;.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics of support for far-reaching climate action</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"><italic>The government should do what climate scientists say even if the majority of people is opposed</italic></th><th align="left"><italic>Protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs</italic></th><th align="left"><italic>Measures to decrease CO2 emissions are to be allowed to make social welfare arrangements worse</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.
