These things take up a lot of our time, something that is not easy to find in the neoliberal university. And reviewing books for academic journals constitutes a type of labor that the neoliberal university does not value one iota. I have a colleague at the University of Liverpool who was told by his Head of Department to stop writing book reviews because they do not count in the Research Excellence Framework or &#8220;REF,&#8221; as it is known&#8212;the league table system for universities in the United Kingdom. His heroic response was to do nothing else other than to write book reviews.</p>
