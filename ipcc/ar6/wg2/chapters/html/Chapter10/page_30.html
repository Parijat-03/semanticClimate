The latter also reported the highest number of flood disasters and greater spatial coverage in recent decades as compared with previous decades. In the Middle Yellow River basin, which has become much warmer and drier, climate variability accounts for 75.8% of streamflow decrease during 1980&#8211;2000, whereas during 2001&#8211;2016, change in land use and cover was the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5% of the decline (Bao et&#160;al., 2019).

In the Lancang-Mekong River basin, climate variability would have contributed 45% more flood occurrences in the middle of the basin, while reservoir operation reduced it by 36% during 2008&#8211;2016 as compared with 1985&#8211;2007 (Yun et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.13" top="450.64"><span x0="42.52" y0="450.64" x1="296.13" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 44.82; y0: 450.64; y1: 460.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">In western China, the total annual snow mass declines at a rate of 3.3 &#215; 10</span><span x0="73.39" y0="442.76" x1="76.05" style="x0: 73.39; x1: 76.05; y0: 442.76; y1: 448.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">9</span><span x0="78.33" y0="438.6" x1="134.36" style="x0: 78.33; x1: 82.9; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">pg per decade (</span><span style="x0: 134.36; x1: 138.93; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="134.36" y0="438.6" x1="141.21">p </span><span x0="141.26" y0="438.6" x1="296.11" style="x0: 141.26; x1: 146.96; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">&lt; 0.05), which accounts for approximately 0.46% of the mean of annual snow mass (7.2 &#215; 10</span><span x0="239.42" y0="430.76" x1="244.74" style="x0: 239.42; x1: 242.08; y0: 430.76; y1: 436.29; width: 2.66; font-size: 5.54; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">11</span><span x0="247.02" y0="426.6" x1="296.09" style="x0: 247.02; x1: 251.59; y0: 426.6; y1: 436.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">pg).

While rising temperatures can reduce streamflow via evapotranspiration, it can enhance groundwater discharge to rivers due to permafrost thawing. In permafrost-developed basins, the thawing permafrost will continue to result in increased streamflow. However, with further permafrost degradation in the future, the positive effect of permafrost thaw on streamflow would probably be offset by the negative effect of the increase in basin evapotranspiration. This could result in a situation where runoff reaches threshold level and then declines. This is clearly marked in the Ob River basin, which is characterised by the highest precipitation, whereas in the case of the Yenisei and Lena rivers, further research is needed.</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.06" top="114.63"><span x0="42.52" y0="114.63" x1="296.06" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 114.63; y1: 124.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The HKH region is susceptible to floods and related hazards caused by a cloud burst and other landscape-based processes such as glacial lake outburst floods, which can seriously damage property, lives and infrastructure (Shrestha et&#160;al., 2010).

Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods caused by the failure of glacial lakes (Cook et&#160;al., 2018; Ahluwalia et&#160;al., 2016). In Kedarnath, India (western Himalaya), a flash flood was triggered by glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) released from the Chorabari glacial lake in June 2013 which caused extensive flooding, erosion of riverbanks and damage to downstream villages and towns, as well as the loss of several thousand lives (Rafiq et&#160;al., 2019; Das et&#160;al., 2015).

Contamination of drinking water is caused by wildfires and drought that contribute to elevated levels of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphates), heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium), salts (chloride and fluorides), hydrocarbons, pesticides and even pharmaceuticals. Heavy rains and flooding also increase nutrients, heavy metals and pesticides, as well as turbidity and faecal pathogens in water supplies&#8211;especially when sewage treatment plants are overwhelmed by runoff (Mora et&#160;al., 2018). Pharmaceuticals and personal-care products (from source to disposal) are contributing to the vulnerability of urban waters. A study of vulnerability assessment of urban waters in highly populated cities in India and Sri Lanka, through analysing the concurrence of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), enteric viruses, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, metals, faecal contamination and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), also underlines the need for a resilience strategy and action plan (Rafiq et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="210.7"><span x0="306.57" y0="210.7" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.02; y0: 210.7; y1: 220.2; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Adequate water supply for various uses is crucial for millions of people living in the mountains of Asia. Particularly in the HKH region, mountain springs play an important role in generating stream flow for non-glaciated catchments and in maintaining dry-season flows across many watersheds (Scott et&#160;al., 2019; Stott and Huq, 2014). There is a good deal of evidence that the springs are drying up or yielding less discharge (Tambe et&#160;al., 2012; Tiwari and Joshi, 2014; Sharma et&#160;al., 2016), threatening local communities who depend on spring water for their lives and livelihoods. Some of the main reasons for drying springs include anthropogenic impacts (deforestation, exploitative land use), infrastructure (road construction), socioeconomic changes (increasing demand and modernisation of facilities) and climatic changes (changes in rainfall regime and higher temperature) (Stott and Huq, 2014; Tiwari and Joshi, 2014; Sharma et&#160;al., 2016).</span></div></body></html>
