The EIB and China&#8217;s Green Finance Committee have set the joint goal of a &#8216;common language for green finance&#8217;, including environmental use of proceeds of green bonds, but so far without result (EIB/GFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>). The removal of &#8216;clean coal&#8217; from the list of projects eligible for green bonds is however an important step towards international standards (Shepherd and Weinland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2020</xref>). This was confirmed in the 2021 green bond catalogue jointly issued by the PBoC, NDRC and China Securities Regulatory Commission and in effect from July 2021 (PBoC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021b</xref>). Potentially just as significant is the PBoC&#8217;s &#8216;Assessment Plan for Green Finance of Banking Financial Institutions&#8217;, also&#160;released in 2021. This document, which expands the performance evaluation of financial institutions from green credit to also encompass green bonds, can be seen as a measure to reduce reliance on green credit and further stimulate green bond growth (PBoC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021c</xref>).</p>
