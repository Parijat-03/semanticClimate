Ninety&#8208;eight percent reported that they thought climate change is occurring prior to instruction; 99% reported this thinking at the end of the course. The percentage of these students who were &#8220;extremely sure&#8221; that climate change is happening increased from 44% at the beginning of the semester to 70% at the end of the semester (<italic>&#967;</italic>
