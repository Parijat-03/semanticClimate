The researchers sharing their findings in the field and consulting local communities as illustrated by the conference in Kathmandu show that efforts have been made to create platforms to share voices. However, as we see here, the need for a relational and reciprocal exchange instead of a short-term technical fix persists. Whereas the necessity for scientific research, especially in the context of climate change, cannot be over-stressed, it is crucial that our research projects recognize its extractive nature that is palpable for those experiencing it in the field. Dawa&#8217;s words are a sharp reminder of that, and the work of repairing broken trust that remains.</p>
