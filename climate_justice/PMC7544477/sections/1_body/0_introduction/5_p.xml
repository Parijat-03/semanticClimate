In an age of fossil fuel extractivism and amid growing concern that it may now be &#8220;too late to stop dangerous climate change&#8221; (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Whyte, 2020</xref>), what do such encounters signify?

What are the roles of &#8216;solidarity&#8217; in countering corporate and colonial agendas that converge in the courtroom space? How can a critical lens merging anti-colonial political ecology with legal geography help to guide an understanding of the criminalisation of peaceful civil disobedience<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref>
and Indigenous-led resistance?</p>
