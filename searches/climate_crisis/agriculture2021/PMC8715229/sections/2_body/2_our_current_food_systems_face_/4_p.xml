<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0150">A concentration of actors on the supply or demand side can lead to harmful market power positions and create vulnerabilities. Where there is only a limited number of exporters, this can create a food security risk for importers, if trade is interrupted. Conversely, if exporters depend only on a small number of importing countries, shifts in demand can quickly affect their income. This can be particularly detrimental to developing countries where the agricultural sector is often a major source of livelihoods and income.</p>
