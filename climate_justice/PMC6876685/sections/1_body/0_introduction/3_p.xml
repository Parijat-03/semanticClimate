<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing society: It is a world&#8208;altering phenomenon that has, and will continue to have, noticeable impacts on the lives of today's college students (IPCC, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; USGCRP, <xref rid="ece35736-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Fortunately, introductory science courses, including introductory biology courses, offer opportunities to teach a large audience of students with a wide range of interests, backgrounds, and experiences regarding climate change. Instructors in these courses typically aim to increase students' knowledge of content, but as the student quoted in the epigraph above makes clear, instruction can affect more than content knowledge. This anonymous student comment, left as course evaluation feedback for the large undergraduate biology course examined in this article, reminds us that instruction can also influence how students feel, and consequently, how students engage with and use content knowledge&#8212;or not. The challenge confronting many instructors is this: How can we ensure that students leave our courses not only with an increased understanding of the science of climate change (including the potential severity of its impacts), but also with a sense of purpose and empowerment?</p>
