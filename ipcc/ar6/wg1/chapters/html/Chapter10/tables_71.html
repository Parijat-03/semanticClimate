      <td>Communicating the full extent of available information on future climate for a region, including an uncertainty quantification, can\nact as a barrier to the uptake and use of such information (Lemos et al., 2012; Daron et al., 2018). To address the need to simplify\nand increase the relevance of information for specific contexts, recent studies have adopted storyline and narrative approaches\n(Section 1.4.4.2; Hazeleger et al., 2015; Shepherd et al., 2018). As such, these approaches are an important tool for the climate\ninformation distillation (Section 10.5.3). Here we assess these in a regional climate information context, namely for exploring\nuncertainties, embedding climate information into a given user context, and communicating climate change information.</td>

      <td>Physical climate storylines are self-consistent and plausible unfolding of a physical trajectory of the climate system, or a weather or\nclimate event, on time scales from hours to multiple decades (Section 1.4.4.2). Storylines that condition climatic features and processes\non a set of plausible but distinct large-scale climatic changes enables the exploration of uncertainties in regional climate projections\n(Box 10.2, Figure 1 and Section 10.3.4.2). For instance, Zappa and Shepherd (2017) condition projected changes in European surface\nwind speeds on different plausible projections of tropical upper tropospheric warming and the polar vortex strength in the CMIP5\nmulti-model ensemble. Storylines of specific events are generated to explore the unfolding and impacts of comparable events in\ncounterfactual climates (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et al., 2015b; Takayabu et al., 2015; Hegdahl et al., 2020; Sillmann et al., 2021). Those\nevent storylines can be based on pseudo-global warming studies (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et al., 2015b; Takayabu et al., 2015; see\nSection 10.3.2.2), selected and possibly downscaled events from long-term climate projections (Hegdahl et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a),</td>
