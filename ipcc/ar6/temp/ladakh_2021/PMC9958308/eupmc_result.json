Employing collaborative autoethnography as our research method, we use our life stories of growing up in Asia and studying and working in the West to reflect on our journey of becoming scholars comfortable in engaging Chinese wisdom traditions\u2014Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism\u2014in Western academia. We share how our experiences of encouraging Asian spiritual traditions and engaging in contemplative practices led us to embrace the ontology and epistemology of Eastern wisdom traditions, and come to understand Eastern philosophies as living wisdom, as a way of being and knowing. We further detail how comprehending\u00a0Eastern philosophies at a heart-mind level has transformed our views on humanity, allowing us to see the common struggles of\u00a0peoples in the East and West, Asia and North America. Our ontological and epistemological transformations brought about by Eastern contemplative practices have enabled us to see that there is not such a thing as \u201cAsia\u201d or \u201cNorth America. \u201d Rather, we interare and we are Earth citizens. We end our inquiry by advocating for the need to engage spirit as method and conduct research and teaching with a heightened sense of we-togetherness, from a heart and mind that is open and boundless, for the benefits of all our relations\u2014visible and invisible, human and more than human.", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Undetermined", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Decolonization", "Autoethnography", "Contemplative Inquiry", "Asia As Method", "Asian Epistemologies", "Asian Ontologies"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9958308/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9958308/pdf/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9958308"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9958308?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2023-03-02", "firstIndexDate": "2023-03-02", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-03-02", "dateOfRevision": "2023-03-02", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-02-25", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-02-25"}
