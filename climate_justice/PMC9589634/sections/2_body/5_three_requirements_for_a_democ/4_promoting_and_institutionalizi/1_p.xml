As it stands, there is evidence from even the most advanced democracies that decision-making is all too often exclusive and only selectively responsive to citizens&#8217; concerns (Sch&#228;fer and Z&#252;rn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021</xref>). One prominent suggestion for institutional innovation has thus been the organization of democratic mini-publics&#8212;lot-based citizen forums that discuss salient topics and develop recommendations for policy-making (see Dryzek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>).</p>
