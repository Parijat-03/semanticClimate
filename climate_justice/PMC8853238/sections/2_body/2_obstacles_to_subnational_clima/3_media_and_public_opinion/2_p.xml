Moreover, media coverage of climate change, which is heavily driven by elite cues, is likely to shape public attitudes (Carmichael and Brulle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>). Research on media portrayals of science-based issues shows that quantity and content of media coverage influences state-level agenda-setting (Bromley-Trujillo and Karch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). As such, when coverage presents climate science as uncertain, or fails to engage the views of different subgroups (Howarth and Black <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2015</xref>), that coverage can shift climate change off of public and governmental agendas (Boykoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>).</p>
