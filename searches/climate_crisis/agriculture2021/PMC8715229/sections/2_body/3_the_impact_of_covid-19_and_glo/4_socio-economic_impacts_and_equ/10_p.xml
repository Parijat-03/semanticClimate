The World Food Program estimates that 346 million children missed meals due to school closures at the start of the pandemic<xref rid="fn0025" ref-type="fn">5</xref>
(<xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">WFP, 2020b</xref>). In some high-income countries, such as the USA, more than half the students in primary and secondary schools are usually dependent on subsidized school meals. According to <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Headey et al. (2020)</xref>, 6.7 million children under five years of age could face wasting due to pandemic-related income losses. Reductions in nutrition and health services resulting from lockdown measures or diversions could lead to an additional 130,000 deaths among the under-fives, with more than half of deaths concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Headey et al., 2020</xref>). Lockdowns and social distancing measures have been strictly applied for older people due to their vulnerability, leading to disruptions in nutritional services. In addition to the aforementioned vulnerability of children, past studies have shown that older people, even in advanced economies, may be especially susceptible to undernutrition (<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Margetts et al., 2003</xref>) and food insecurity (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
