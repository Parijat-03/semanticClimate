Speaking to a crowd of about 80 people in an event room of a community center in the LES, she also emphasized the iterative design process of the first phase of the project: &#8220;[T]he community engagement was really highlighted as key to the process, and we heard again and again the importance of what they called iterative design, that they listened to communities and incorporated them, tinker with design, re-think it, and bring it back to the community.&#8221; Naomi&#8217;s and Catalina&#8217;s statements are typical, illustrating the view of participants that the iterative, repetitive process allowed them to view their own input reflected in city plans. Designers and planners would repeatedly come back to the neighborhood and show, through an evolution of architectural sketches and diagrams, that their input had been considered and included in official plans.</p>
