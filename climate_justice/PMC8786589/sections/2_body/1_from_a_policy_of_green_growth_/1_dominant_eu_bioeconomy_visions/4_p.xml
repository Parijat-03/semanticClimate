While the strategy was an influential political tool that led to individual EU member states developing their own strategies (EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>), it faced severe criticism among the civil society and research community (for a summary of critiques, see Kurki and Ahola-Launonen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2021</xref>). Consequently, in late 2018, after a stakeholder consultation process (L&#252;hmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>), the EC presented the revised bioeconomy strategy for Europe entitled &#8220;A Sustainable Bioeconomy for Europe: Strengthening the Connection Between Economy, Society and the Environment&#8221; (EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>).</p>
