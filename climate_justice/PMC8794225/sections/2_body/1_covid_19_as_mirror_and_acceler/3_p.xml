In 2021, overall life expectancy in the US decreased by one year, two for African Americans, and three for Latinos (Andrasfay and Goldman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>). The two defining epiphanies of early COVID&#8212;heightened concern for essential workers and the heightened vulnerability of marginalized groups&#8212;were quickly subsumed by greed and politics. When racial disparities in COVID 19 mortality, evidence of extreme material inequality, became clear, Trump seemed to lose interest in stopping the spread (Serwer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2020</xref>), his calculated neglect adding urgency to Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police. Trump had already ordered meat processing plants to stay open and okayed faster line speeds in chicken factories, increasing injury and contagion among a mainly immigrant workforce (Colvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Such actions, alongside the push to force everyone back to work, rendered visible the harsh edges of an economic system that routinely devalues the lives of working people in general, and of women, Black, and brown and disabled people in particular. Since then, COVID 19 and its uneven violence have become increasingly normalized.</p>
