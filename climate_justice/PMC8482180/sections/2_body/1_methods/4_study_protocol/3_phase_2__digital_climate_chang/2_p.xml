<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Given the increasing concern over the adverse impacts of climate change on food systems and health, this digital platform is being adapted to capture relevant environmental, food, and solastalgia-related data in the community of &#206;le-&#224;-la-Crosse (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The Advisory Council is leading the conversation regarding customization of digital platform features to address three key objectives: (1) ethical monitoring of risk that is conducted by engaging citizens in real time, (2) real-time interventions to mitigate risk by providing citizens with community-specific alerts, and (3) implementation of a digital decision-making dashboard to facilitate Indigenous self-governance and data sovereignty. There are three guiding principles that will enable the achievement of these objectives: (1) citizen empowerment and data ownership to maximize active engagement, (2) privacy to ensure that sensitive data such as citizen location are not stored in external servers [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and (3) security and scalability to replicate the platform across multiple jurisdictions. The office of the Mayor is leading the development and coordination of rapid response strategies in the community.</p>
