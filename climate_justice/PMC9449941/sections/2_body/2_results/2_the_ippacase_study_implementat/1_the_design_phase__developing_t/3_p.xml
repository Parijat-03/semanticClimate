The background analysis identified cause&#8211;impact chains, indicators, scope, and target states of a sustainable urban mobility &#8220;vision&#8221;. The <italic>policy package of alternative drives</italic> resulted in two core measures accompanied by four ancillary measurements. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> gives an overview of the measures and details the policies. In the following, we summarize the single measures.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Policy Package &#8220;Increase of alternative drive via CO<sub>2</sub> emission performance standards, and a CO<sub>2</sub> price component for fossils fuels&#8221; (&#8220;alternative drives&#8221;)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>1.

Core: &#8220;CO</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic> price component for fossil fuels&#8221;</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>&#8226; What: Introduction of a CO<sub>2</sub> price component for fossil fuels that ensures the mathematically necessary increase in user costs of 2% p.a. from 2010 to 2030. For petrol, a total sum of 83.7&#160;ct/L from the mineral oil tax and the CO<sub>2</sub> component must be achieved in 2030, for diesel a total of 89.2&#160;ct/L. Setting the CO<sub>2</sub> price component at &#8364;150 per t of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2030 (equivalent to 36.7&#160;ct/L of petrol and 39.6 ct/L of diesel). At the same time adjustment of the mineral oil tax: for petrol, reduction from today&#8217;s 66.96&#160;ct/L to 47&#160;ct/L; for diesel, increase from today&#8217;s 46.38&#160;ct/L to 49.6&#160;ct/L</p><p>&#8226; Objective: To reduce the attractiveness of conventionally operated vehicles by increasing variable costs (costs of use) by 2% p.a. (2010 to 2030)</p><p>&#8226; Type: economic</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>3. Ancillary: &#8220;Reform of the motor vehicle tax&#8221;</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>&#8226; What: Conversion of the motor vehicle tax to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as the sole assessment variable. The tax exemption for electric vehicles remains in place. Up to a limit of 95&#160;g, 0.40 euros per gram will be charged, and from 96 to 115&#160;g/km 0.80 euros per gram. Between 115 and 135&#160;g/km, 2.00 euros per gram will be charged, and over 136&#160;g/km 5.00 euros/g will be charged. Above 200&#160;g/km the amount per gram of CO<sub>2</sub> rises to 15.00 Euro</p><p>&#8226; Objective: To further reduce the attractiveness of conventionally powered vehicles by increasing the fixed costs (maintenance costs) for vehicles with fossil-fuelled drives</p><p>&#8226; Type: economic</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>4. Ancillary: &#8220;Technology development for intelligent charging &amp; tariff systems&#8221;</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>&#8226; What: The on-going development and expansion of the public charging infrastructure (=&#8201;charging points in public spaces that can be provided by public or private providers) will be continued and supplemented by encouraged technology development which aims for solutions for intelligent, network-related charging considering, e.g. adequate tariff systems</p><p>&#8226; Goal: Unproblematic integration of charging processes into the electricity system, avoidance of user restrictions</p><p>&#8226; Type: promotional policy</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>5. Ancillary: &#8220;Guideline on parking fees&#8221;</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>&#8226; What: The objective of this measure is the gradual and transparently announced increase in parking costs by 50% by 2030 compared to the current level. Since the municipalities have to implement this step, a guideline for municipalities on the climate-friendly design of parking fees is to be drawn up as part of this measure. The municipalities should then adapt their parking fee structures accordingly</p><p>&#8226; Objective: In order to reduce the attractiveness of conventional vehicles, the aim is to make parking more expensive, preferably for conventional vehicles</p><p>&#8226; Type: informative</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>6. Ancillary: &#8220;Target group-oriented information campaign on electric mobility&#8221;</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>&#8226; What: A target group-oriented information campaign is to be developed and launched to help overcome the reluctance and scepticism towards electric mobility. The target groups should be private users as well as commercial and fleet operators</p><p>&#8226; Objective: Closing knowledge gaps, reducing risk perception, supporting the purchase decision</p><p>&#8226; Type: informative</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Source: own elaboration</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
