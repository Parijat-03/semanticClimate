The social determinants of health are at the nexus of these interlinkages. The COVID-19 pandemic, increasing frequency of catastrophic climate disasters and greater social unrest owing to inequities demonstrate that all sectors in society are implicit and have a role to play. The health sector&#8217;s intervention is however of utmost importance because it has a stewardship role in protecting and promoting health (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Baum <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Given this position, governments and the international community should ensure that deliberate steps are taken to strengthen the institutional structures and instructional reforms that foster the ability of health workers including those from sectors outside health, to address these challenges to secure a healthier, more sustainable and more equitable future for all.</p>
