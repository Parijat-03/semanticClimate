Husnayaen et&#160;al. (2018) assessed the Semarang coast in Indonesia and showed that 20% of the total coastline (48.7 km) is very highly vulnerable.

Mangrove species with a wide distribution and larger propagules showed high colonisation potential in the new habitats compared with other species (Nehru and Balasubramanian, 2018).
