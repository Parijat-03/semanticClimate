[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] noted that the SDA method only covers a handful of globally aggregated sectors. In response, they used a global multiregional input&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;output database to translate the sectoral emission pathways used in the SDA method into geographically differentiated emission intensity trajectories (emissions per value added) for 57 economic sectors across 140 regions. This essentially allows companies to set scope 3 targets as a function of SDA-based scope 1 and 2 targets of individual scope 3 actors while accounting for regional differences in base year emission intensities. It is unclear to what extent the Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] method has been adopted by companies. We note that a potential shortcoming of this approach is the underlying assumption that all companies in a given sector and region have the same average value chain, involving the same average emission intensities, regardless of whether a company has already taken efforts to source low-carbon products prior to setting an SBT.</p>
