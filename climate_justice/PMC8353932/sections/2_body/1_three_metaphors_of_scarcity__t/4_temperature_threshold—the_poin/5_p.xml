Together with the popular use of the &#8216;tipping points&#8217; metaphor in climate change communication (Russill and Nyssa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>; van der Hel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2018</xref>), the burning embers helped cement the notion of temperature threshold that, if crossed, will lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in the climate system. A prominent example of this is the latest call by scientists to declare a climate emergency in which the world is approaching a &#8216;global cascade of tipping points&#8217; that might happen even at between 1&#176;C and 2&#176;C of warming (Lenton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>).</p>
