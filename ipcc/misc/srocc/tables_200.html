      <td>(D&#8217;Amato et al. 2010). Excess morbidity and mortality related to extremely poor air quality are found in many cities worldwide (Harlan\nand Ruddell 2011). Some emissions that lead to reduced air quality are also contributors to climate change (Shindell et al. 2018;\nde Coninck et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>(Davies et al. 2011; Edmondson et al. 2014). However, compared to overall carbon emissions from cities, its mitigation effects are\nlikely to be small (medium confidence). UGI nevertheless has an important role in adapting cities to climate change (Demuzere et al.\n2014; Sussams et al. 2015; Elmqvist et al. 2016; Gill et al. 2007; Revi et al. 2014). Adaptation through UGIs is achieved through, for\nexample, (i) reduction in air temperature (Cavan et al. 2014; Di Leo et al. 2016; Feyisa et al. 2014; Z&#246;lch et al. 2016; Li et al. 2019)\nwhich can help improve human health and comfort (e.g., Brown and Nicholls 2015; Klemm et al. 2015), (ii) reduction in the energy\ndemands of buildings through the use of green roofs and walls (e.g., Coma et al. 2017), and (iii) reduction in surface water runoff\nand flood risk (Zele&#328;&#225;kov&#225; et al. 2017). Given that UGI necessarily involves the retention and management of non-sealed surfaces,\nco-benefits for land degradation will also be apparent (limited evidence, high agreement) (Murata and Kawai 2018; Scalenghe\nand Marsan 2009).</td>

      <td>Urban agriculture is one aspect of UGI that has the potential to both meet some of the food needs of cities and reduce land degradation\npressures in rural areas (low confidence) (e.g., Wilhelm and Smith (2018)). Urban agriculture has many forms, such as backyard\ngardening, allotments, plants on rooftops or balconies, urban-fringe/peri-urban agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, livestock grazing\nin open spaces and vertical farming (Gerster-Bentaya 2013) (Section 5.6.5).</td>

      <td>Consuming locally produced food and enhancing the efficiency of food processing and transportation can minimise food losses,\ncontribute to food security and, in some circumstances, reduce GHG emissions (Brodt et al. 2013; Michalsk&#253; and Hooda 2015; Tobarra\net al. 2018) (Section 5.5.2.3). Furthermore, urban agriculture has the potential to counteract the separation of urban populations\nfrom food production. This separation is one driver of the transition towards more homogeneous, high-protein diets, which are\nassociated with increased GHG emissions (Goldstein et al. 2017; Moragues-Faus and Marceau 2018; Magarini and Calori 2015). Barriers\nto the uptake of urban agriculture as a climate change mitigation option include the need for efficient distribution systems to ensure\nlowered carbon emissions (Newman et al. 2012) and the concern that urban agriculture may harbour pathogenic diseases, or that its\nproducts be contaminated by soil or air pollution (Hamilton et al. 2014; Ercilla-Montserrat et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>(Section 2.2). Future changes to both climate and urbanisation will enhance warming in cities and their surroundings, especially\nduring heatwaves (high confidence). Urban and peri-urban agriculture and, more generally, the implementation of urban green\ninfrastructure, can contribute to climate change mitigation (medium confidence) as well as to adaptation (high confidence),\nincluding co-benefits for food security and reduced soil-water-air pollution.</td>
