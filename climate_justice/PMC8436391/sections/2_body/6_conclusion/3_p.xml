<p>Building on the work of educators before us, and as reflected in this themed section on social
work education, our pedagogy aims to reignite analysis, creativity and higher order thinking and
learning for practical action in these contemporary conditions. Deepening analysis of the
COVID-19 context and critical situated thinking through engaging students in research and praxis
strengthens ideas about what is possible and opens up opportunities and avenues previously
undiscovered. This provides new confidence, impetus and forward looking future practitioners who
can innovate and adapt. Working collectively in the classroom opens up possibilities and
supports the development of dynamic and innovative forms of practice alongside groups and
communities to respond to the issues that they face in the present context.</p>
