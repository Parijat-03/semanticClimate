<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par5">An energy consumption of 0&#8211;100 Gigajoule (GJ) per capita corresponds to a steep growth in HDI from around 0.3 to 0.8 (Steinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>; see also Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 347). After 100&#8211;110 GJ per capita, the increases in HDI points peter out, and additional energy consumption provides minimal to no gains in HDI (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 348). For example, countries with as high per capita consumption as 300 GJ or above are approximately at HDI 0.9 (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>: 348; see also Steinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>). Thus, energy consumption on a global level has the shape of a diminishing marginal utility; that is, small increases in energy consumption have a substantial impact on well-being for the least well-off (those consuming under 100 GJ per capita and being below HDI 0.8), whereas substantial increases in GJ per capita are required for minuscule, if any, increases in HDI for those above 100 GJ per capita.</p>
