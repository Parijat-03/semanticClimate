The common, underlying cause of both is a planetary-scale, anthropogenic change in the natural environment&#8212;the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and terrestrial land, respectively. An exponential growth in scale and speed of human activities (&#8220;Great Acceleration&#8221;) constitutes the two crises as truly global challenges of the Anthropocene (Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). They are equally &#8220;black elephants&#8221; in that scientists have long been sounding the alarm about a calamity caused by human actions but the governments paid woefully insufficient attention, despite knowing that ignorance will lead to dire consequences.</p>
