Unions have one of the highest approval ratings in the last fifty years according to the Gallup poll, and their approval among young people aged 18&#8211;34 is the highest of any age group (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>). A recent study of students attending public colleges in Los Angeles County and also working at the same time found that 85 % would join a union or a worker center if given the opportunity, as compared to 59 % in a similar survey in 2015 (UCLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>, 29). Sixty-one percent had increased their involvement in organizing and 59 % increased their involvement in electoral politics since Covid-19 (UCLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>, 27). While the study&#8217;s participants may not be reflective of the general population, the results reflect the reality that there are many young activists who see unions as a tool for social justice and who have been motivated by the pandemic and police killings of African-Americans to increase their activism. Despite these developments, however, it would be a mistake not to recognize the very real challenges faced by the labor movement.</p>
