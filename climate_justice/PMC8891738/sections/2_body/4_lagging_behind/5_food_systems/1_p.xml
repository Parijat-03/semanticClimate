The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of exisiting systems, especially in the countries relying heavily on agricultural imports or foreign workers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> Food production is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The leave no one behind principle in the food systems transformation has crucial implications for youth, women and communities in remote areas in terms of job creation, reduction of workload and positive health implications. Therefore, digital tools and reliable data have the power to derisk investmens, improve access to finance and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. A holistic approach to policy environment and its effective coordination between government institutions, both national and local can unlock the benefits of integration of sustainable energy in food systems. Last, but not least, looking into new financing models, clustering smaller investments and demand stimulation have the potential to improve the investment environment in developing countries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21">21</xref></p>
