Susan Narelle Chapman and Lyndal O&#8217;Gorman from Australia explore how arts experiences may allow young children to engage with others&#8217; lived experiences.. The languages of play and the Arts powerfully shape young children&#8217;s understanding of themselves and their world and offer an inclusive medium for expressing important messages. Arts immersion may be used as a means of providing young children with meaningful opportunities to engage in learning about issues relating to sustainability.</p>
