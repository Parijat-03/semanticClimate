<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A separate inter-city dataset was created where all 44,476 census tracts were aggregated by city. This allows for the determination of which cities have the highest levels of SUHI intensity exposure for each demographic group. The mean SUHI intensity for each city was calculated by averaging the SUHI intensity for all representative tracts for each year. The rankings for the cities based on each demographic group are presented in dot plot diagrams. A segregation index using the multi-group version of the Duncan Dissimilarity (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic>) metric was also calculated at this step using the counts of each population group [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This index relates the amount of each group&#8217;s population that would have to move between tracts for each census tract to have the same percentages of population distribution as the respective city. Values range between zero and one, zero being perfect integration and one being absolute segregation. All 191 cities were included in these calculations. The index was calculated using the R statistical platform and the OasisR package [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-12314" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
