Sudan reports political sanctions by some developed countries, which have restricted the country&#8217;s access to bilateral climate finance. It has restricted its ability to contribute under the PA. Political instability in a country creates a leadership gap and governance issues. Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic state the need for political stability and an effective governance/policy structure where all the stakeholders (N5.1) join together in a supra-party manner for climate action. Benin suggests regulations on the international import of carbon-intensive electronic equipment. Uganda, Mozambique, and Lao PDR need to strengthen their ability to regulate, integrate (N4.1), and implicate climate policies.</p>
