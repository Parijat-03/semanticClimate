<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A specific focus on scientific publications allows for using well-understood &#8220;scientometric&#8221; methods applied to available corpora of publication data. Kullenberg and Kasperowski (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) have used a scientometric approach to identify the subjects or &#8220;focal points&#8221; of CS research activities, whereas, Pelacho et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) analyze co-publication networks to characterize and compare collaborations in the CS community in an international perspective. This enables the CS landscape to be addressed as a whole yet is limited to publication databases as data input and addresses only specific issues about CS. CS Track widens the scope by including data from different web and social media sources that capture external manifestations of CS activities.</p>
