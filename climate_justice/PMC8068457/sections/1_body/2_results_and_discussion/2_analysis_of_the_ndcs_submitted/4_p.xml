Within this group, there are developing countries with emissions per capita below the world average, to which the MCJ allocates a budget for the future period higher than that emitted in the historical period considered. One argument here could be that perhaps these countries do not need their entire allocated emissions budget and that a &#8220;communicating vessels&#8221; effect should be incorporated into the distribution model or a possible implementation of it. However, before entering into this type of argument, it is necessary to consider both the historical evolution of and the socioeconomical differences between these countries.</p>
