During the final group debrief, participants most often reported that they did not participate because of the lack of time, scheduling conflicts and lack of payment. Self-reported activist behaviour did not increase, neither for environmental education and leadership (+0.09 out of 7), nor for emissions reduction behaviors (+0.21 out of 7) (all <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>s<sub>37</sub> &lt; 1.60, all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>s &gt; 0.10 all <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>s &lt; 0.30).</p>
