After the six-week video intervention, three psychological factors increased: affective engagement, collective efficacy, and self-efficacy. Exit interviews of 40 participants suggested that the main trigger of these changes was the video content, in particular the information about extreme weather events, health impacts and collective and individual activism.</p>
