Media framing of climate change can also affect attitude change and scholars have considered how climate change communication must be tailored to different audiences to be persuasive. Most prominently among audience segmentation work resides the &#8216;Global Warming&#8217;s Six Americas&#8217; project on climate communication (Leiserowitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2011</xref>). Howarth and Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2015</xref>) note that &#8220;the communication of climate change historically has been generic, untailored and untargeted&#8221; (p. 506). As such, more effort is needed to carefully frame communications and dialogue that values different perspectives on climate change in order to increase concern and engagement across each of the&#160;50 US states.</p>
