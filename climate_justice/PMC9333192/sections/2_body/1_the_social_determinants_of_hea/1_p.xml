The social determinants of health are the non-clinical factors that influence health outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021d</xref>). They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, their access to power, money and resources, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life (the latter group is referred to as &#8216;structural&#8217; social determinants of health inequities). Yet they have not been, and continue not to be adequately prioritized by policymakers, administrators and curriculum developers for pre-service education and in-service training programmes for health workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed attention to the social determinants of health and health inequity. The extent of inequities has been laid bare by the pandemic and the profound implications of people&#8217;s social and economic conditions on their ability to follow public health advice have been evident globally (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Paremoer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Following the pandemic, it is clear that social determinants of health have worsened for many, threatening to stall progress against the spread and impact of the virus, particularly in settings where public health and social measures have not been adequate (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Paremoer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021c</xref>). Achievement of the SDGs has also been threatened by the pandemic (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baum <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
