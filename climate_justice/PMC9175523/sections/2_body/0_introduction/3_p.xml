The social domain of sustainability is therefore key. However, there remains a dearth of understanding of how just transitions might be realized. Here we argue for the adoption of 5 &#8216;pillars&#8217;, through which key stakeholders might begin to plan for just transitions. These are: (I) an ecological prosperity; (II) a decarbonized economy; (III) a shared cost burden; (IV) a governance new deal; and (V) a just resilience.</p>
