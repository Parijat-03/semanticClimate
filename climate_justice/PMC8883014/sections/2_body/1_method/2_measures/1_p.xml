<bold>Climate Change Anxiety</bold> was assessed using the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). This 13-item scale assesses the negative cognitive and emotional impacts and functional impairment related to perceptions of climate change. It includes two subscales, including Cognitive Emotional Impairment (8 items) and Functional Impairment (5 items). Items in the Cognitive Emotional Impairment subscale include, &#8220;I go away by myself and think about why I feel this way about climate change,&#8221; while the Functional Impairment subscale includes items such as, &#8220;My concerns about climate change interfere with my ability to get work or school assignments done.&#8221; Responses were reported using a Likert scale, with response options ranging from 1&#8201;=&#8201;Never to 5&#8201;=&#8201;Almost always. Mean scores were calculated, with higher scores indicating higher levels of climate anxiety. This scale showed good reliability and validity in a U.S. adult sample and in a Filipino emerging adult sample (Clayton &amp; Karazsia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Reyes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). Reliability in the current sample was acceptable (total score &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.89; Cognitive Emotional Impairment subscale &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.87; Functional Impairment subscale &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;.79).</p>
