In addition, homes owned in African American and Hispanic communities tend to represent a disproportionately larger part of the household total wealth than in the white community (ibid), meaning that these communities have fewer liquid assets to turn to in the event of a natural disaster even when they do own their home. Accordingly, when a disaster strikes, if the house is impacted, there is a larger negative impact to that household&#8217;s total wealth because the house makes up a disproportionately larger share of that total wealth.</p>
