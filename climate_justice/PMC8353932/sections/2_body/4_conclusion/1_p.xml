In practice, however, the IPCC has been acting as a powerful <italic>discursive</italic> agent that directs people into seeing the challenge of climate change from a &#8216;transcendental vantage point&#8217; (Mahony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>) or &#8216;view from nowhere&#8217; (Borie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>; see also Shapin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1998</xref>). In particular, the IPCC helped fixate the story of climate change to the single metric of global mean temperature. As the IPCC becomes the global authority of climate science, 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C not only becomes a policy target but also comes to represent the collective psyche of our times.</p>
