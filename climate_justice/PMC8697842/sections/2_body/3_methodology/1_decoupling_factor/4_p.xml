In the first case, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decrease, while the real income increases (Freitas &amp; Kaneko, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). In the second case, both CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income increase, but the growth rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is considerably smaller than real income. As R&#252;stemo&#287;lu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>) demonstrated in a case study, Germany is an example of a country that achieved an absolute decoupling between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and real income, and this is an impressive result for sustainability targets.</p>
