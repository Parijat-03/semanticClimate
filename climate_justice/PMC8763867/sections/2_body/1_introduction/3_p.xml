The workshop was designed to accomplish several objectives. First, we wanted to give participants a brief introduction to the field of community organizing with a focus on one specific leadership skill: public narrative. Second, we wanted learners to put these skills into practice by developing and delivering their own story of self. Finally, we wanted learners to consider how they could apply these practices by describing one way in which public narrative skills could be utilized to support health equity work during residency training.</p>
