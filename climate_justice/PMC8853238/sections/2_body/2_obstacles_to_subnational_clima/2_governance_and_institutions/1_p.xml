Democratic control of state governments facilitates climate policy adoption while Republican leadership acts as a veto point for climate legislation, often necessitating a Democrat trifecta to achieve bill passage (Bromley-Trujillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>; Coley &amp; Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Trachtman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2020</xref>). There is also evidence to suggest a &#8220;counter-partisan response&#8221; at the state level (Miras and Rouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2021</xref>); that is, when one party controls the federal government, the opposing party may become emboldened to act at the state-level (Bromley-Trujillo and Holman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>).</p>
