Only a handful of countries have been able to pursue progressive redistributive land policies during neoliberalism, namely, Brazil and the Philippines since 1988 (Franco, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wolford, <xref rid="CIT0106" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); South Africa, with different variants of a hybrid market-led/state-driven land redistribution (Cousins, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ntsebeza &amp; Hall, <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>); Colombia (Grajales, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>); Zimbabwe since 2000 (Moyo, <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Scoones et al., <xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); Mozambique&#8217;s 1997 Land Law (Negr&#227;o, <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and the retention of Indonesia&#8217;s Basic Agrarian Law of 1960 through the neoliberal era. In each of these cases, the strategy deployed by mainstream political forces was to limit and contain the scope and pace of policy implementation. Outright abandonment of existing redistributive land policies may prove to be too politically risky because of possible popular protest. The strategy for containing such policies involves slowing down the speed of implementation, delimiting the scope, defunding the land agency or ministry, or rendering altogether dormant a potentially redistributive land policy &#8211; as seen, in varying contexts and extents, in the countries referenced in this paragraph.</p>
