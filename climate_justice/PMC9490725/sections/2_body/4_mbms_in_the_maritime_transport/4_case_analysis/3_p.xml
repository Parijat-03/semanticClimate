<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par51">One objection that draws on both fairness and corruption is the issue of climate justice which is rarely considered in maritime transport policy. The IMO insists on NMFT rather than CBDR which comes from the UNFCCC, thus this fundamental barrier to a fair transition is built into the IMO (Monios &amp; Ng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2021</xref>). Selin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>) propose to return maritime carbon reduction responsibility from the IMO to the UNFCCC and thus put maritime emissions back into national accounts, on the rationale that the UNFCCC has more signatories than the IMO and allows for differential treatment between countries. This change could also make it easier to target the shipowners, because each country could then apply regulations to the shipowner according to the country in which the company is located rather than the current IMO approach that targets the users. It has been argued that shipowners could be a better actor to target since they order the vessels and choose the parameters whereas increased fuel prices target the users of existing ships (Poulsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2021</xref>). It is essential that any chosen policy aims to stop building new fossil-fuelled vessels in the near future given that they last more than 20&#160;years. MBMs will not incentivise a move away from fossil fuels while oil and gas are abundant and cheap and fossil-fuelled vessels can still be built, purchased and operated. If the IMO will not ban fossil-fuelled ships, maritime emissions might be better placed in country accounts, which again links both fairness and corruption objections in terms of concrete goals and outcomes and a link between citizens, businesses and national responsibility for emissions.</p>
