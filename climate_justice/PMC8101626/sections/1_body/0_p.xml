<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The social media microblogging platform Twitter has been used previously to study the benefits and engagement of users at medical conferences [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref>]. Tweets and hashtags allow users to engage in discourse around certain topics and find common areas of interest. Twitter can be used to disseminate important scientific knowledge [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and reach a wide audience, especially those who are unable to attend in person or are present but at a different session [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Researchers have performed analyses to identify what constitutes a successful tweet and have examined factors associated with likelihood of a retweet (ie, presence of media or a hyperlink), a marker of impact and dissemination [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, in 2019, novel medical education tools within Infectious Diseases such as ID Journal Club (@IDJClub) have been implemented on the Twitter platform [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the transition of IDWeek 2020 (October 21 to October 25, 2020) to a completely virtual event due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we sought to evaluate engagement of users, social networks, and topics discussed on Twitter to understand the characteristics of this new conference forum. We hypothesize that these data could be valuable to the IDWeek planning committee and may aid Twitter users, new or old, in determining accounts or users of interest.</p>
