These differing assessments were found to be due to different principles of justice that vary across different individuals, contexts, situations, and relationships (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Deutsch, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Jasso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Sabbagh and Schmitt, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Skitka et al., 2016</xref>). In this article, we focus on the first aspect, namely individuals. Dispositional interindividual differences were found to influence the perception of justice, i.e., differences in <italic>justice sensitivity</italic> (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Lerner, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">M&#252;nscher, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Preiser and Beierlein, 2017</xref>). Justice sensitivity is regarded as a personality trait (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt et al., 1995</xref>), as it was found to be consistent across situations and contexts (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt et al., 2009</xref>). Justice sensitivity is defined as the tendency to perceive injustice that results in negative emotional responses. Together, the perception of injustice and its negative evaluation form action tendencies to mitigate the injustice (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Baumert and Schmitt, 2016</xref>). This process is in line with the appraisal theory developed by <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arnold (1960)</xref>, which states that emotions, i.e., action tendencies, are the result of two cognitive processes: the factual cognition (here: Is the situation just or not?) and the evaluative cognition (here: evaluating injustice as negative &#8211; or positive).</p>
