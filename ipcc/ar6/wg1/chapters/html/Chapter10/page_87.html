It is characterized by mild humid winters and dry warm or hot summers, which are associated with large scale subsidence that is partly related to the downward branch of the Hadley circulation. Other factors affecting the Mediterranean circulation include the monsoon heating over Asia (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Cherchi et&#160;al., 2014; Oss&#243; et&#160;al., 2019) and circulation anomalies induced by topography (Simpson et&#160;al., 2015). Seasonal and interannual variability is strongly linked to natural modes of variability (Section&#160;10.6.4.4). The Mediterranean Sea acts as an evaporation source that dominates the&#160;regional hydrological cycle, which is characterized by local cyclogenesis and a&#160;separate branch of the mid-latitude storm track (Lionello et&#160;al., 2016). It also affects remote locations such as the Sahel (Park et&#160;al., 2016; Section&#160;10.4.2.1). Strong storms can develop over the Mediterranean. Among these, Medicanes are particularly destructive and exhibit several similarities with tropical cyclones (Cavicchia et&#160;al., 2014; Kouroutzoglou et&#160;al., 2015; Gaertner et&#160;al., 2018). The Mediterranean region is also characterized by strong land-atmosphere coupling and feedbacks (Seneviratne et&#160;al., 2006) generating prolonged droughts and intense heatwaves, which can also affect continental Europe (Zampieri et&#160;al., 2009). Other aspects of Mediterranean climate include regional winds, which can be very strong due to the channelling effect (Obermann et&#160;al., 2018) and extreme rainfall during autumn (Ducrocq et&#160;al., 2014; Ribes et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="173.97" top="114.48"><span x0="56.69" y0="114.48" x1="173.97" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.4.3 Observational Issues</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="90.6"><span x0="56.69" y0="90.6" x1="304.75" style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The Mediterranean region spans a&#160;wide variety of countries and&#160;economies.

(2016a, b) compared three different datasets (CRU, UDEL, and MERRA) with the available ground observations and found that although the geographical distribution of the bias is qualitatively similar for the three datasets, differences exist, with the absolute bias being generally lower in Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) especially over North Africa during the summer and winter season.

The influence of those modes of variability over the eastern Mediterranean is recognized by some studies (Chronis et&#160;al., 2011; Kahya, 2011; Black, 2012; Blad&#233; et&#160;al., 2012), but disputed by others (Ben-Gai et&#160;al., 2001; Ziv et&#160;al., 2006; Donat et&#160;al., 2014; Turki et&#160;al., 2016; Zamrane et&#160;al., 2016; Han et&#160;al., 2019). During positive summer NAO phase, associated with an upper-level trough over the Balkans, the Mediterranean is anomalously wet (Blad&#233; et&#160;al., 2012). Drivers of Mediterranean climate variability include modes of variability such as the AMV (Sutton and Dong, 2012) and the Asian monsoon (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Logothetis et&#160;al., 2020). In addition, the increase of GHGs (e.g.,&#160;Zittis et&#160;al., 2019), the decrease of anthropogenic aerosols over Europe and the Mediterranean since the 1980s resulting from air pollution policies (Turnock et&#160;al., 2016), and anthropogenic land-use change (Mill&#225;n, 2014; MedECC 2020) have been shown to be linked to the regional warming. The role of the zonal averaged circulation as a&#160;driver for the Mediterranean climate has been stressed by (Garfinkel et&#160;al., 2020).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="198.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="198.6" x1="563.27" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 198.6; y1: 208.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The attribution of observed Mediterranean summer warming to above drivers and implications for future projections will be discussed in Sections 10.6.4.5 and 10.6.4.6.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="483.94" top="150.48"><span x0="315.21" y0="150.48" x1="483.94" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.6.4.5 Model Simulation and Attribution Over&#160;the&#160;Historical&#160;Period</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="114.6"><span x0="315.21" y0="114.6" x1="563.24" style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 114.6; y1: 124.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: QWBOYX+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Observational datasets show large agreement on the historical (1960&#8211;2014) temperature evolution at basin-wide scale (Figure&#160;10.20e), with an enhanced warming since the 1990s, and the early decades of the 21st&#160;century being on average approximately more than 1&#176;C warmer than late 19th&#160;century levels (van der Schrier et&#160;al., 2013; Cramer et&#160;al., 2018; Lionello and Scarascia, 2018; Figure&#160;10.20e). </span></div></body></html>
