For example, women&#8217;s traditional knowledge adds value to a society&#8217;s knowledge base and supports climate change adaptation practices (Lane and McNaught 2009). In dryland environments, populations have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation to cope with high climatic variability, manage dynamic interactions between local communities and ecosystems, and sustain livelihoods (Safriel and Adeel 2008; Davies 2017).

Flexibility and adaptiveness are hallmarks of such systems (Richards 1985a; Biggs et al. 2013), and documented examples include: traditional integrated watershed management in the Philippines (Camacho et al. 2016); widespread use of terracing, with bene&#64257;ts, in cases of both intensifying and decreasing rainfall (Arn&#225;ez et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017b) and management of water harvesting and local irrigation systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016). Rice cultivation in East Borneo is sustained by traditional forms of shifting cultivation, often involving intercropping of rice with bananas, cassava and other food crops (Siahaya et al. 2016), although the use of &#64257;re in land clearance implies trade-offs for climate change mitigation which have been sparsely assessed. Indigenous practices for enhanced soil fertility have been documented among South Asian farmers (Chandra et al. 2011; Dey and Sarkar 2011) and among Mayan farmers, where management of carbon has positive impacts on mitigation (Falkowski et al. 2016). Korean traditional groves or &#8216;bibosoop&#8217; have been shown to reduce wind speed and evaporation in agricultural landscapes (Koh et al. 2010). Particularly in the context of changing climates, agriculture based on ILK that focuses on biodiversi&#64257;cation, soil management, and sustainable water harvesting holds promise for long-term resilience (Altieri and Nicholls 2017) and rehabilitation of degraded land (Maikhuri et al. 1997). ILK is also important in other forms of ecosystem management, such as forests and wetlands, which may be conserved by efforts such as sacred sites (Ens et al. 2015; Pungetti et al. 2012). ILK can also play an important role in ecological restoration efforts, including for carbon sinks, through knowledge surrounding species selection and&#160;understanding of ecosystem processes, like &#64257;re (Kimmerer 2000). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="200.07" top="327.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.93; y0: 327.42; y1: 337.42; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="327.42" x1="200.07">Constraints on the use of ILK</span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.99; y0: 315.52; y1: 325.02; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="315.52" x1="457.49">Use of ILK as a resource in responding to climate change can be constrained in at least three ways (</span><span style="x0: 457.5; x1: 462.07; y0: 315.52; y1: 325.02; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="457.5" y0="315.52" x1="515.57">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 515.56; x1: 518.2; y0: 315.52; y1: 325.02; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="515.56" y0="315.52" x1="557.59">). First, the rate&#160;of climate change and the scale of its impacts may render incremental adaptation based on the ILK of smallholders and others, less relevant and less effective (Lane and McNaught 2009; Orlowsky and Seneviratne 2012; Huang et al. 2016; Morton 2017). Second, maintenance and transmission of ILK across generations may be disrupted, for example, by formal education, missionary activity, livelihood diversi&#64257;cation away from agriculture, and a general perception that ILK is outdated and unfavourably contrasted with scienti&#64257;c knowledge (Speranza et al. 2010), and by HIV-related mortality (White and Morton 2005). Urbanisation can erode ILK, although ILK is constantly evolving, and becoming integrated into urban environments (J&#250;nior et al. 2016; Oteros-Rozas et al. 2013; van Andel and Carvalheiro 2013). Third, ILK holders are experiencing dif&#64257;culty in using ILK due to loss of access to resources, such as through large-scale land acquisition (Siahaya et al. 2016; Speranza et al. 2010; de Coninck et al. 2018). The increasing globalisation of food systems and integration into global market economy also threatens to erode ILK (G&#243;mez-Baggethun et al. 2010; Oteros-Rozas et al. 2013; McCarter et al. 2014). The potential role that ILK can play in adaptation at the local level depends on&#160;the con&#64257;guration of a policy&#8211;institutions&#8211;knowledge nexus (Stringer et al. 2018), which includes power relations across levels and interactions with government strategies (Alexander et al. 2011; Naess 2013). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="247.33" top="147.42"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 82.15; y0: 147.42; y1: 157.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="79.37" y0="147.42" x1="247.33">Incorporation of ILK in decision-making </span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 81.67; y0: 135.52; y1: 145.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="79.37" y0="135.52" x1="557.65">ILK can be used in decision-making on climate change adaptation, sustainable land management (SLM) and food security at various scales and levels, and is important for long-term sustainability (</span><span style="x0: 308.6; x1: 313.17; y0: 123.53; y1: 133.03; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="308.6" y0="123.53" x1="365.79">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 365.79; x1: 368.43; y0: 123.53; y1: 133.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="365.79" y0="123.53" x1="557.58">). Respect for ILK is both a requirement and an entry strategy for participatory climate action planning and effective communication of climate action strategies (Nyong et al. 2007). The nature, source, and mode of knowledge generation are critical to ensure that sustainable solutions are community-owned and fully integrated within the local context (Mistry and Berardi 2016). Integrating ILK with scienti&#64257;c information is a prerequisite for such community-owned solutions. Scientists can engage farmers as experts in processes of knowledge co-production (Oliver et al. 2012), </span></div></body></html>
