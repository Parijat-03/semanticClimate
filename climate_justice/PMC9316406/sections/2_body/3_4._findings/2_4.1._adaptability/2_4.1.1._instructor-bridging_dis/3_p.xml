These two domains&#8212;systemic injustices and extreme events&#8212;jointly jeopardize individual and collective health and well-being. Responsively, social workers are vital players in advocacy for environmental/climate justice, resilience, and sustainability. This advocacy role motivates social workers to inform and improve related policies and programs to protect human rights in disaster settings, especially on behalf of vulnerable and marginalized groups. These ongoing efforts in advocacy and policy/program development and improvement support the social workers&#8217; efforts toward protecting affected individuals, families, and communities.</p>
