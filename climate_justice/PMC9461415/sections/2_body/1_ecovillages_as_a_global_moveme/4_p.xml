While a &#8220;North in the South&#8221; is configured by a reduced number of privileged people, and a &#8220;South in the North&#8221; is constituted by a growing marginalized contingent, the current levels of socioeconomic inequality are close to those registered at the beginning of the twentieth century, at the height of Western imperialism, with the richest 10% holding 78% of global wealth and half of the population holding only 2% of it, as reported by <italic>The World Inequality Report 2022</italic> (Chancel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2022</xref>). According to this source, the overcoming of twenty-first century challenges, including the climate emergency and the massive biodiversity loss, will not be possible without addressing such socioeconomic inequality levels. The <italic>Global Risk Perception Survey</italic> published this year by the World Economic Forum (World Economic Forum - WEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2022</xref>) also emphasizes global inequalities and polarization, threats to livelihoods, and mental health deterioration as the main challenges in the short term, while it refers to failures in climate actions and noncompliance with the Paris Agreement (United Nations &#8211; UN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2015</xref>) as the greatest long-term global threats.</p>
