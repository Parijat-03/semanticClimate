Throughout the first phase of the project, the design phase, participants reported satisfaction with the planning process, as they could see their own input reflected in the evolution of city plans. Catalina,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> a decades-long activist of Puerto Rican descent, summarized the process while sitting in her office at a nonprofit dedicated to help low-income residents find affordable housing in the LES. She said: &#8220;Designers and other folks would come with preliminary designs and ask the community a bunch of questions.&#8221; She then highlighted the iterative process that went on after the first design sketch: &#8220;Then they [the designers] would come back again and present how they took that feedback and put it into the plan, then ask even more questions.&#8221;</p>
