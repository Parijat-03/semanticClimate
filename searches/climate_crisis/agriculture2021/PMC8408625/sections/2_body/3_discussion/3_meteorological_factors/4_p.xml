This result is consistent with the literature, i.e., a steady flow of aquatic resources for mosquitoes has a positive association with their abundance, and therefore an increase in disease transmission <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Rainfall patterns have also been shifting since the 1950s (see <xref rid="sec0110" ref-type="sec">Additional File 1: Figs. S1&#8211;4</xref>) although unlike climate, there is no a clear trend and results are more difficult to interpret. In general, Austria, Croatia, and Italy are seeing less intense rainfall in the summer months, but higher in autumn, whereas Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Romania are receiving more rainfall in summer months.</p>
