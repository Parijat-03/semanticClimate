The resultant scarcity of resources has had overreaching impacts on the food chains all over the world, especially in Africa (Botzen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>), such as low productivity, the disappearance of species of plants and animals, and drought due to extreme weather conditions (global warming). Meanwhile, there is a growing worry regarding the increased rate of greenhouse gases on a global scale owing to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation which has led to an increase in carbon dioxide and methane levels (Centi and Perathoner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). With the melting of polar ice caps engendered by global warming, there is a likelihood that about 1.7 million people will be forced to relocate or migrate from their native Pacific regions (Henderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>) thereby constituting overpopulation in the recipient regions and making these regions vulnerable to several socio-economic and health problems such as food scarcity, high rate of unemployment, and disease outbreak. The increased occurrence of typhoons and hurricanes due to extreme weather conditions has also brought about the loss of lives, properties, and loss of livelihoods in several regions of the world. Furthermore, due to the increase in temperature, novel viruses, insects, and vector-borne diseases are emergently putting the global community at risk, especially in Africa. This extensive impact across the various facets of society highlights the complex interrelationship often overlooked by all and sundry.</p>
