An expanded view of adaptation benefits requires a changed perspective of sovereignty; power and national interests may induce nations toward an obligatory responsibility of financing adaptation in the PVCs. As a policy domain, adaptation is socially defined and socially constructed. So, it begs to be considered with multi-disciplinary and multi-focal lenses. Such framing is expected to raise its status on the global policy plane, thereby making a difference in boosting finance. The application of the Polluter Pays Principle in varied forms, both nationally or internationally, serves as the key to such a policy design. Even tax-funded national public goods do not benefit all citizens equally, and some may not benefit at all. Adequate support for climate adaptation may encourage developing countries to go for higher mitigation. The global stock-take under Article 7.14 of the PA in 2023 will be a turning point in realizing these ideas. We believe this discourse will surely be contested in the policy and discursive world, and that is the ultimate purpose of this article.</p>
