Chemical soil degradation processes include relatively simple changes, like nutrient depletion resulting from the imbalance of nutrient extraction on harvested products and fertilisation, and more complex ones, such as acidi&#64257;cation and increasing metal toxicity. Acidi&#64257;cation in croplands is increasingly driven by excessive nitrogen fertilisation and, to a&#160;lower extent, by the depletion of cation like calcium, potassium or magnesium through exports in harvested biomass (Guo et al. 2010). One of the most relevant chemical degradation processes of soils in the context of climate change is the depletion of its organic matter pool. Reduced in agricultural soils through the increase of respiration rates by tillage and the decline of below-ground plant biomass inputs, SOM pools have been diminished also by the direct effects of warming, not only in cultivated land, but also under natural vegetation (Bond-Lamberty et al. 2018). Debate persists, however, on whether in more humid and carbon-rich ecosystems the simultaneous stimulation of decomposition and productivity may result in the lack of effects on soil carbon (Crowther et al. 2016; van Gestel et al. 2018). In the case of forests, harvesting&#160;&#8211; particularly if it is exhaustive, as in the case of the use of residues for energy generation&#160;&#8211; can also lead to organic matter declines (Achat et al. 2015). Many other degradation processes (e.g.,&#160;wild&#64257;re increase, salinisation) have negative effects on other pathways of soil degradation (e.g., reduced nutrient availability, metal toxicity). SOM can be considered a&#160;&#8216;hub&#8217; of degradation processes and a&#160;critical link with the climate system (Minasny et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="399.57"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.06; y0: 399.57; y1: 409.07; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="399.57" x1="313.21">Land degradation processes can also start from alterations in the hydrological system that are particularly important in the context of climate change. Salinisation, although perceived and reported in soils, is typically triggered by water table-level rises, driving salts to the surface under dry to sub-humid climates (Scho&#64257;eld and Kirkby 2003). While salty soils occur naturally under these climates (primary salinity), human interventions have expanded their distribution, secondary salinity with irrigation without proper drainage being the predominant cause of salinisation (Rengasamy 2006). Yet, it has also taken place under non-irrigated conditions where vegetation changes (particularly dry forest clearing and cultivation) have reduced the magnitude and depth of soil water uptake, triggering water table rises towards the surface. Changes in evapotranspiration and rainfall regimes can exacerbate this process (Scho&#64257;eld and Kirkby 2003). Salinisation can also result from the intrusion of sea water into coastal areas, both as a&#160;result of sea level rise and ground subsidence (Colombani et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="183.59"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 183.59; y1: 193.09; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="183.59" x1="313.26">Recurring &#64258;ood and waterlogging episodes (Bradshaw et al. 2007; Poff 2002), and the more chronic expansion of wetlands over dryland ecosystems, are mediated by the hydrological system, on occasions aided by geomorphological shifts as well (Kirwan et al. 2011). This is also the case for the drying of continental water bodies and wetlands, including the salinisation and drying of lakes and inland seas (Anderson et al. 2003; Micklin 2010; Herbert et al. 2015). In the context of climate change, the degradation of peatland ecosystems is particularly relevant given their very high carbon storage and their sensitivity to changes in soils, hydrology and/or vegetation (Leifeld and Menichetti 2018).

Vegetation clearing processes associated with land-use changes are not limited to deforestation but include other natural and seminatural ecosystems such as grasslands (the most cultivated biome on Earth), as well as dry steppes and shrublands, which give place to croplands, pastures, urbanisation or just barren land. This clearing process is associated with net carbon losses from the vegetation and soil pool. Not all biotic degradation processes involve biomass losses. Woody encroachment of open savannahs involves the expansion of woody plant cover and/or density over herbaceous areas and often limits the secondary productivity of rangelands (Asner et al. 2004; Anadon et al. 2014). These processes have accelerated since the mid-1800s over most continents (Van Auken 2009). Change in plant composition of natural or semi-natural ecosystems without any signi&#64257;cant vegetation structural changes is another pathway of degradation affecting rangelands and forests. In rangelands, selective grazing and its interaction with climate variability and/or &#64257;re can push ecosystems to new compositions with lower forage value and a&#160;higher proportion of invasive species (Illius and O&#180;Connor 1999; Sasaki et al. 2007), in some cases with higher carbon sequestration potential, yet with very complex interactions between vegetation and soil carbon shifts (Pi&#241;eiro et al. 2010). In forests, extractive logging can be a&#160;pervasive cause of degradation, leading to long-term impoverishment and, in extreme cases, a&#160;full loss of the forest cover through its interaction with other agents such as &#64257;res (Foley et al. 2007) or progressive intensi&#64257;cation of land use. Invasive alien species are another source of biological degradation. Their arrival into cultivated systems is constantly reshaping crop production strategies, making agriculture unviable on occasions. In natural and seminatural systems such as rangelands, invasive plant species not only threaten livestock production through diminished forage quality, poisoning and other deleterious effects, but have cascading effects on other processes such as altered &#64257;re regimes and water cycling (Brooks et al. 2004). In forests, invasions affect primary productivity and nutrient availability, change &#64257;re regimes, and alter species composition, resulting in long-term impacts on carbon pools and &#64258;uxes (Peltzer et al. 2010).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="207.67"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 207.67; y1: 217.17; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="207.67" x1="571.77">Other biotic components of ecosystems have been shown as a&#160;focus of degradation processes. Invertebrate invasions in continental waters can exacerbate other degradation processes such as eutrophication, which is the over-enrichment of nutrients, leading to excessive algal growth (Walsh et al. 2016a). Shifts in soil microbial and mesofaunal composition&#160;&#8211; which can be caused by pollution with pesticides or nitrogen deposition and by vegetation or disturbance regime shifts&#160;&#8211; alter many soil functions, including respiration rates and carbon release to the atmosphere (Hussain et al. 2009; Crowther et al. 2015). The role of the soil biota in modulating the effects of climate change on soil carbon has been recently demonstrated (Ratcliffe et al. 2017), highlighting the importance of this lesser-known component of the biota as a&#160;focal point of land degradation.
