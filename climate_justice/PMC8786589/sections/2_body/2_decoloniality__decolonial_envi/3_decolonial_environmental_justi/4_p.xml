The argument is for the need to go beyond participation and towards the self-governing authority of informal indigenous or other customary structures and authorities, which exist in parallel with formal state systems (Lund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>). The implication is that indigenous and other traditional authorities have the right to govern their own territories within their own indigenous and/or customary governing structures. This aspect is opposed to procedural justice which argues for participation <italic>within</italic> the existing domineering political and legal structures and which can lead to cultural and political assimilation (Sakshi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>; Rodr&#237;guez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>).</p>
