Trexler and Schendler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] expressed concern about companies making use of ineffective renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets in order to report emission reductions against their SBTs at a low cost, and Walenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] later presented similar concerns. SBTi explicitly prohibits the use of emission offsetting for reporting target progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yet Giesekam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] observed this practice among companies with SBTs. SBTi does allow renewable energy certificates through the market-based scope 2 accounting approach of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, this practice should be scrutinized given evidence that corporate purchasing of renewable energy certificates often does not lead to additional renewable energy generation or actual emission reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Likewise, the language around SBTs for &#8220;renewable electricity procurement&#8221; is problematic, given that companies can meet such targets by purchasing renewable energy certificates, which do not involve any physical procurement of renewable electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
