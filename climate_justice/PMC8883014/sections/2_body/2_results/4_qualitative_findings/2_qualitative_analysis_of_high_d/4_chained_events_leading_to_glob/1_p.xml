Future economic collapse.&#8221; One participant noted, &#8220;Almost everything will be affected by climate change, mostly negatively.&#8221; Participants worried about &#8220;the civil unrest caused by the migration&#8221; of &#8220;millions of people,&#8221; that will exacerbate &#8220;ethnic/racial and [socioeconomic] inequality.&#8221; Thus, they expected climate change to provoke conflict escalation, describing a process in which &#8220;Weather becomes less reliable, people move around, life becomes more precarious for many, perhaps fervor in group identification increases (e.g., religious), and the chances for conflict to spark increase,&#8221; including &#8220;the chances of nuclear weapon usage.&#8221;</p>
