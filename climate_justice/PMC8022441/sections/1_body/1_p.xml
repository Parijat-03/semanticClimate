<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The contributors to this set of Perspectives on populism come together around the puzzle that &#8220;populist movements often appeal to gender, sexual, racial, disability, class, and national stereotypes in fostering distrust of democratic political institutions, even as they profess to support the empowerment of &#8220;the people&#8221; (Botting and Gould this issue). Both for understanding these anti-democratic movements and for identifying the political resources for democratic responses, we need to focus more on the ideologies that these leaders access than the charisma with which they mobilize them. There are many charismatic people, but they don't all mobilize anti-democratic, anti-intellectual, or anti-elite movements. Rather, citing Rosanvallon (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), Nadia Urbinati argues that populism is a &#8220;negative politics&#8221; (Urbinati, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, p. 113): &#8220;[P]opulism's adversarial identity is claimed by a representative leader, who mobilizes the media to convince the audience that he embodies the people's many forms of discontent against traditional parties' spineless mainstreamism&#8221; (Urbinati, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, p. 113). This framing makes it contextually versatile and potentially dangerous, but as I argue, it is also potentially fruitful for recognizing the cross-coalition mobilizations of critics of structural injustice as a populist anti-politics as well.</p>
