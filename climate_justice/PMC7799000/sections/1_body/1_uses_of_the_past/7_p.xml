And we did what any good curator would do&#8212;we held onto the objects. Twenty years from now, it'll be fine. The other example is this giant piece of steel from the World Trade Center brought back to the museum. It came in on a Saturday, and we did not have much time to deal with it. So, we put it in the freight elevator. I went to work on Monday, and one of the senior managers of the museum was screaming at me, taking me to task for having polluted the entire building. He said that the building crew, who were all Vietnam War veterans, had seen the piece of steel. And they said that there were human remains on it. They knew this because they were veterans, and they knew what human remains smelled like. In fact, it did have kind of a creepy smell, but it was really mostly cutting oil and jet fuel and stuff like that. I'm pretty confident it contained no human remains. But the senior manager quickly moved from human remains to pointing to where the construction workers had originally sprayed insulation on the steel while the World Trade Center was being built and said, &#8220;that's asbestos, and you've contaminated the building.&#8221; What he didn't know was that we actually knew where the asbestos was in the World Trade Center. The building did have some asbestos, but it was only on the first twenty-four to twenty-eight floors.</p>
