A disturbance may cause inconvenience, including high costs of compliance&#160;with environmental regulations, thereby initiating a&#160;change of behaviour (Cosens et al. 2017). In a&#160;similar vein, multiple regulatory requirements existing at the time of a&#160;disturbance may result in emergent processes and novel solutions in order to correct for piecemeal regulatory compliance (Cosens et al. 2017). Lastly, windows of opportunity can be created by a&#160;policy mix or portfolio that provides for creative destruction of old social processes and thereby encourages new innovative solutions (Kivimaa et al. 2017b) (Section&#160;7.4.8).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="301.24" top="579.01"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.44; y0: 579.01; y1: 591.01; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="579.01" x1="301.24">7.4 Policy instruments for land and climate</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="555.52"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 555.52; y1: 565.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="555.52" x1="313.26">This section outlines policy responses to risk.

For ef&#64257;ciency, equity and effectiveness considerations, the appropriate choice of instrument for the context is critical and, across the topics addressed in this report, the instruments will vary considerably. A&#160;key consideration is whether the bene&#64257;ts of the action will generate private or public social net bene&#64257;ts. Pannell (2008) provides a&#160;widely-used framework for identifying the appropriate type of instrument depending on whether the actions encouraged by the instrument are private or public, and positive or negative. Positive incentives (such as &#64257;nancial or regulatory instruments) are appropriate where the public net bene&#64257;ts are highly positive and the private net bene&#64257;ts are close to zero. This is likely to be the case for GHG mitigation measures such as carbon pricing. Many other GHG mitigation measures (more effective water or fertiliser use, better agricultural practices, less food waste, agroforestry systems, better forest management) discussed in previous chapters may have substantial private as well as public bene&#64257;t.

Indeed, land tenure is recognised as a&#160;factor in barriers to sustainable land management and an important governance consideration (Sections&#160;7.4.9 and 7.6.4). A&#160;thorough analysis of the implications of policy instruments temporally, spatially and across other sectors and goals (e.g.,&#160;climate versus development) is essential before implementation to avoid unintended consequences and achieve policy coherence (Section&#160;7.4.8).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="488.31" top="567.42"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.92; y0: 567.42; y1: 577.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="567.42" x1="488.31">7.4.1 Multi-level policy instruments</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="543.52"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.29; y0: 543.52; y1: 553.02; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="543.52" x1="571.77">Policy responses and planning in relation to land and climate interactions occur at and across multiple levels, involve multiple actors, and utilise multiple planning mechanisms (Urwin and Jordan 2008). Climate change is occurring on a&#160;global scale while the impacts of climate change vary from region to region and even within a&#160;region. Therefore, in addressing local climate impacts, local governments and communities are key players. Advancing governance of climate change across all levels of government and relevant stakeholders is crucial to avoid policy gaps between local action plans and national/ sub-national policy frameworks (Corfee-Morlot et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="411.54"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 411.54; y1: 421.04; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="411.54" x1="571.8">This section of the chapter identi&#64257;es policies by level that respond to land and climate problems and risks.

Categories of instruments include regulatory instruments (command and control measures), economic and market instruments (creating a&#160;market, sending price signals, or employing a&#160;market strategy), voluntary of persuasive instruments (persuading people to internalise behaviour), and managerial (arrangements including multiple actors in cooperatively administering a&#160;resource or overseeing an issue) (Gupta et al. 2013a; Hurlbert 2018b).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.78" top="243.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 243.55; y1: 253.05; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.55" x1="571.78">Given the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of risk, a&#160;comprehensive, portfolio of instruments and responses is required to comprehensively manage risk. Operationalising a&#160;portfolio response can mean layering, sequencing or integrating approaches. Layering means that, within a&#160;geographical area, households are able to bene&#64257;t from multiple interventions simultaneously (e.g., those for family planning and those for livelihoods development). A&#160;sequencing approach starts with those interventions that address the initial binding constraints, and then adding further interventions later (e.g., the poorest households &#64257;rst receive grant-based support before then gaining access to appropriate micro&#64257;nance or market-oriented initiatives). Integrated approaches involve cross-sectoral support within the framework of one programme (Scott et al. 2016; Tengberg and Valencia 2018) (Sections&#160;7.4.8,&#160;7.5.6 and&#160;7.6.3).</span></div></body></html>
