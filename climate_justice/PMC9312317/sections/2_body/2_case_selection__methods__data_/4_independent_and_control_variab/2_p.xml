After all, climate politics itself is a multidimensional issue. The FFF protest survey included three items that cover key aspects of debates about how far-reaching climate action should be. Respondents were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the following statements (using a 5-point scale): &#8216;The Government must act on what climate scientists say even if the majority of people are opposed&#8217;, &#8216;Protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs&#8217; and &#8216;Measures to decrease CO<sup>2</sup> emissions cannot be allowed to make social welfare arrangements worse&#8217;. In short, these items measure whether respondents believe climate action should be allowed to trump basic principles of majoritarian democracy, economic growth and social security, respectively. Admittedly, these statements cannot be directly linked to any particular view on transformational adaptation, and it is instead the general support for far-reaching climate action that is implied in transformational approaches that is primarily tapped into. Scores for the latter item were reversed to make sure that higher scores on all items indicate greater support for far-reaching measures. The correlation between these items is moderate (0.41, p 0.000) between the first two items, non-significant between the first and third and weak between the second and third (0.07, p 0.001). It is therefore again preferable to include them separately in the analyses.</p>
