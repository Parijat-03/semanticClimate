<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0065">Despite the links between climate-related disasters and internal, regional, and international migration, the term environmental or climate refugees lacks formal definition, recognition or protection under international law (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Afifi and J&#228;ger, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Atapattu, 2020</xref>). There is also no agreement as to whether <italic>people on the move</italic> should be called &#8216;climate migrants&#8217; or &#8216;climate refugees&#8217;. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) prefers the term &#8216;environmental migrant&#8217; arguing that refugees are driven away from their home country due to fear of persecution resulting from violent conflict, famine, torture, or other cruel or inhuman conditions (<xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">IOM, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0625" ref-type="bibr">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 2018</xref>). The IOM has also flagged the difficulty of pinning migration on climate change. The organization argued that the opening of the 1951 Refugee Convention to include climate change-related reasons could weaken traditional &#8216;refugee status&#8217; and lead to the exclusion of categories of people in dire need of protection (<xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">IOM, 2014</xref>). Recently, the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) recommends the use of &#8216;<italic>climate-displaced persons&#8217;</italic> (CDPs) to underline the involuntary displacement caused by climate-related events (<xref rid="b0565" ref-type="bibr">Robinson, 2017</xref>). While useful, this terminology is yet to be adopted by all UN agencies or member states .</p>
