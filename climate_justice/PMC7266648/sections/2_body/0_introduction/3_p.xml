They no longer need to be consumers and passive spectators. They can become creators and primary subjects. It is in this sense that the Internet democratizes&#8221;. Equally, similar sentiment was echoed in the deliverance of e-democracy as a means to afford previously passive audience a virtual platform to engage with their elected representatives and the state. By combining both the communicative tenements of structural functionalism (which dictates that well-functioning communication system underpins a well-functioning government) and non-discriminatory individualism, Clift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>) asserted that &#8220;e-democracy&#8221; was a contemporary project that should be undertaken by and with liberal democratic governments as a means for citizens to reclaim the power of communication from mass institutions, creating online public spaces for citizens to both express and also develop&#8212;through dialogue&#8212;collective interests.</p>
