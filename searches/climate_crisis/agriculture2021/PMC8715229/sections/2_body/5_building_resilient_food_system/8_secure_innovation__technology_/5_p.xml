<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0525">Feeding a growing and more affluent population will require increases in crop and livestock productivity and diversity. Such productivity increases have been shown necessary to decrease the pressure on land resources (e.g., <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">Stehfest et al., 2009</xref>). In light of the threats of climate change, greater emphasis needs to be placed on genetic and trait diversification, both for plants and livestock. While there needs to be a focus on existing stable crops, further applied research is required for exploring alternative, currently under-utilized varieties (e.g., quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, foxtail millet, finger millet), particularly in terms of their potential to raise agricultural productivity and local food security in marginal environments and facilitate the rehabilitation of degraded lands (<xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
