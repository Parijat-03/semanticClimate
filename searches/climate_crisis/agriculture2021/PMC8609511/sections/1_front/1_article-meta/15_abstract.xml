The food and agriculture sectors have also felt these effects. In many countries, the measures taken to curb the spread of the virus were initiated to hinder the supply of agricultural products to markets and consumers inside and outside the borders. How this impacts the food safety, nutrition, and the livelihoods of farmers, fishermen, and others working in the food supply chain depends mainly on short-, medium-, and long-term policy responses. Epidemics pose severe challenges to the food system in the short term, but they also offer an opportunity to face challenges and accelerate the transformation of the food and agricultural sectors to increase resilience. The aim of the review was to highlight the valuable insight on the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian agricultural system and rural economy, as well as potential strategies for post-pandemic recovery.</p></abstract>
