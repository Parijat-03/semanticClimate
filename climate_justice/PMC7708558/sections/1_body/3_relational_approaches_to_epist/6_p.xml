<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par30">In the field of philosophy, our review shows that relational epistemologies are being developed to help us think transversally across different geo-social scales. Integral approaches to ecology, also known as integral ecology, cross-boundaries between the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences (e.g. Esbj&#246;rn-Hargens and Zimmerman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Mickey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2014</xref>; Mickey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>). O&#8217;Brien and Hochachka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2010</xref>), for example, use integral theory to develop a multi-disciplinary, multi-perspectival understanding of climate change adaptation. Deleuze and Guattari&#8217;s geo-philosophy is another approach to traversing mental, social and environmental ecologies (Bonta and Protevi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>), as is Francois Laruelle&#8217;s non-philosophy, which provides a method for different ways of knowing (e.g. theologically, philosophically, and scientifically) to inform each other without imposing hierarchies (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2013</xref>). These emerging philosophical approaches offer ways to think ecologically; not just to think &#8216;about ecology,&#8217; but rather to think in terms of a &#8216;general ecology&#8217; (H&#246;rl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>). Morton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>) exemplifies work in this mode. He defines ecological awareness as a knowing that loops in on itself, as in a meditation, where one becomes familiar with &#8216;the mesh&#8217; of inter-related happenings and their constitutive relations to oneself.</p>
