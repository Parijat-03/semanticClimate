This channel is for the Hackathon and related materials on semanticClimate.
Summary:
The UN’s IPCC has published a corpus of 7 major reports (10000+ pages 2021-2023) on Climate Change. The hackathon will analyse these using modern informatics tools to add structure, semantics and ontology.
What would you like to do with such a rich set of knowledge objects

Who are we?
semanticClimate has been developed over 3 years driven by a group of scientists and information professionals with special support from 
@Gita
 (Keynote), National Inst for Plant Genomics (NIPGR, New Delhi). The leaders  for this hackathon are @simonWorthington 
@Shweata Hegde
 (fresh from running a real-life hybrid climate hackathon in Delhi)  and 
@Peter Murray-Rust
 . We’ll be joined by several interns and volunteers  from NIPGR.
@yasin (food and agriculture)
@Shiwani (high mountains and the cryosphere)
and 2-3 recently joined interns
We meet virtually (often several times a week) and create tools and output (edited)

Thanks for the info!
(a) I'm a research software engineer in neuroscience, mostly using tools for data analysis and supporting other researchers in my lab
(b) I'm responding based your other comment. I'm on Linux, I'm familiar with python, git, colab, some minimal web experience, static pages (e.g. jekyll). As for text editors, I'm usually use VSCodium and Vim interchangeably. I'm familiar with markdown, CLI, pip and some docker + some CI. (edited)

Wow!
That's great. (Many of the participants have much less experience.
If you have pip here is a 5-minute task (I'll put it in the channel).

@Tuan Pham
 I like your suggestion of virtual environments. We would need to choose one that was easy to install . Would you use venv?

I use both venv (for testing things) and conda (for more long-term projects). venv seems to be the easiest one since it's just 2-3 lines without waiting.
