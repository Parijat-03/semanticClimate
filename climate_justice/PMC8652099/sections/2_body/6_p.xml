In this context, the goal focuses on mobilising finance, suggesting that the developed countries must ensure to keep their promise of organizing USD 100 billion for climate finance per year. In a report by UN (2020) it was stated that the financial counting for 2020 has fallen short and is far from the set target (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/100_billion_climate_finance_report.pdf">https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/100_billion_climate_finance_report.pdf</ext-link>). An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report states that the developed countries are lagging behind by some 20 billion USD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/oecd-climate-finance-projection.htm">https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/oecd-climate-finance-projection.htm</ext-link>). According to Adaptation Gap Report (2020) developing countries still need 70 billion per year to recover the costs for adaptation process and will require USD 140&#8211;300 billion by 2030 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3</ext-link>).</p>
