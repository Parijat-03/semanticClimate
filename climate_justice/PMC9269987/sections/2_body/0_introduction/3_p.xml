<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the context of climate justice, people in industrialized countries can be regarded as the beneficiaries of the detrimental living conditions of people from less developed countries, since the standard of living in industrialized countries is directly connected to the exploitation of natural and human resources in less developed countries (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Dorninger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Hickel et al., 2022</xref>). However, many people may not be completely aware of this fact as the actions that result in driving climate change are probably perceived as an &#8220;unintentional, if unfortunate, side effect&#8221; of goal-directed behavior (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz and Shariff, 2012</xref>). <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz and Shariff (2012)</xref> call this phenomenon the <italic>blamelessness of unintentional action</italic>. Unintentionally caused consequences are judged less harshly than equally severe but intentionally caused consequences (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Guglielmo et al., 2009</xref>). However, the existence or lack of an intention does not change the consequences of an action. Therefore, we hypothesize that people need to identify themselves as responsible to renounce their privileges and act in solidarity with the disadvantaged. Moreover, we assume that this perception is a motivator for pro-environmental behavior change and, therefore, is pivotal to achieving climate justice. Consequently, we focus on justice sensitivity in this article. In the following, we contextualize the role of justice sensitivity on pro-environmental behavior and intention by investigating the joint prediction of pro-environmental behavior and intention with justice sensitivity, emotions, and moral disengagement.</p>
