The lack of policy coherence of China&#8217;s and the EU&#8217;s positioning in different multilateral spaces as well as their motivations to promote foreign aid and sign trade or investment agreements must also be considered. The case of their bilateral relations with Brazil, one of the major global emitters, a very relevant player on international climate negotiations and our comparative variable, is of chief importance to explore contradictions between a pro-climate diplomatic rhetoric and a series of strategic decisions in economic, trade and foreign aid domains. For both China and the EU, Brazil is a strategic partner for commodities, investment and access to a huge domestic market (Saraiva and Gavi&#227;o <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2020</xref>; Cariello <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>); besides, it has historically been in China&#8217;s and EU&#8217;s sphere of economic interests, and analysing both players&#8217; trade profile, investment portfolio and aid programmes in Brazil can be instrumental to understand their controversial local and global impacts&#8212;as demonstrated by deforestation rates resulting from agribusiness expansion whose production is associated with exports and foreign consumption (Kroll and Shogren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>; Themoteo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>).</p>
