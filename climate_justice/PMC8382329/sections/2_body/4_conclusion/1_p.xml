The recognition of adaptation as a global responsibility and adoption of a global goal under the Paris Agreement, though sounds vague, is a step forward. This is an era of increasing GPG issues arising in the global commons, and new conceptualizations, different from neoclassical and national territory-bounded lenses, are needed. Accordingly, with an approach of cognitive flexibility and frame-bridging, we have tried to conceptualize adaptation as a GPG against climate impacts, which are a GPB. The GPB of climate change has its universal but varied effects on countries and populations; these have direct and indirect effects across boundaries and around the globe.</p>
