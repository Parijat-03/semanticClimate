<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Through the Paris Agreement, each country provides a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] &#8211; a plan that outlines their actions to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis. While Tessa is absolutely right about the huge health and debt burdens facing countries in the Global South as the pandemic affects countries in unequal ways, some countries in the Global South are coming forward with stronger plans for mitigation as well as adaptation in their NDCs. In spite of the economic damage from coronavirus &#8211; as global public health measures, value chains, tourism and remittances are disrupted and debt burdens grow &#8211; some countries are increasing the number of activities that they will fund to combat climate change. The revised ambitious NDC from Rwanda is a prime example of that.</p>
