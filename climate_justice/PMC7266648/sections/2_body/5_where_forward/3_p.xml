The contemporary problem is that most civics education is undertaken in bad faith. As Bennett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>) observed, most academic and educational representation of democratic practice bears little resemblance to its actual practice, precisely because this practice in most established democracies falls far short of the underlying idealistic motivations embedded in civics instruction. As &#8220;telling people to participate in bad institutions is mere propaganda&#8221; (Levine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>), there has been a tendency to focus on political spaces that are presented as tabula rasa, be this technological spaces over the last two decades, or an emphasis on social movement participation because ever-renewing social movements maintain the appearance of both democratic because they are inherently participative, and new because they tend to be continuously renamed.</p>
