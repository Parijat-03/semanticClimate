AFSCME.</italic> That will be followed by an analysis of the post-<italic>Janus</italic> tactics of the anti-union forces, including the litigation prompted by the decision, and the impact on unions. The essay will then move to union responses, including increased organizing and legislation enacted at the state level. Finally, the essay will review other developments in labor relations such as the resurgence of the strike and the rise of social movement unionism, concluding with the current divisions in the labor movement relating to police unions. Each of these developments provides hints about the future of labor relations and unions, but much is yet to be written.</p>
