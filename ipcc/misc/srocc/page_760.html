It has &#64258;ourished in recent years due to easily available technical tools for collecting and disseminating information (e.g., cell phone-based apps, cloud-based services, ground sensors, drone imagery, and others), recognition of its free source of labour, and requirements of funding agencies for project-related outreach (Silvertown 2009).

Citizen participation in land-use simulation integrates stakeholders&#8217; preferences through the generation of parameters in analytical and discursive approaches (Hewitt et al. 2014), and thereby supports the translation of narrative scenarios to quantitative outputs (Mallampalli et al. 2016), supports the development of digital tools to be used in co-designing decision-making participatory structures (Bommel et al. 2014), and supports the use of games to understand the preferences of local decision-making when exploring various balanced policies about risks (Adam et al.&#160;2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="92.17" top="255.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 255.56; y1: 265.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="255.56" x1="92.17">There is </span><span style="x0: 94.93; x1: 101.79; y0: 255.56; y1: 265.06; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="94.93" y0="255.56" x1="170.34">medium con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 173.1; x1: 175.91; y0: 255.56; y1: 265.06; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="173.1" y0="255.56" x1="307.59">that citizen science improves SLM through mediating and facilitating landscape conservation decision-making and planning, as well as boosting environmental awareness and advocacy (Lange and Hehl-Lange 2011; Bonsu et al. 2017; Graham et al. 2015; Bonsu et al. 2017; Lange and Hehl-Lange 2011; Sayer et al. 2015; McKinley et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2017, 2014; Gray et al. 2017). One study found limited evidence of direct conservation impact (Ballard et al. 2017) and most of the cases derive from rich industrialised countries (Loos et al. 2015). There are many practical challenges to the concept of citizen science at the local level. These include differing methods and the lack of universal implementation framework (Conrad and Hilchey 2011; Jalbert and Kinchy 2016; Stone et al. 2014). Uncertainty related to citizen science needs to be recognised and managed (Swanson et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2015) and citizen science projects around the world need better coordination to understand signi&#64257;cant issues, such as climate change (Bonney et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="506.86" top="543.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.86; y0: 543.42; y1: 553.42; width: 4.81; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="543.42" x1="506.86">Participation, collective action, and social learning</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="519.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 519.52; y1: 529.02; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="519.52" x1="566.09">As land and climate issues cannot be solved by one individual, a diverse collective action issue exists for land-use policies and planning practices (Moroni 2018) at local, national, and regional levels.

Collective action has resulted in the successful implementation of national-level land transfer policies (Liu and Ravenscroft 2017), rural development and land sparing (Jelsma et al. 2017), and the development of tools to identify shared objectives, trade-offs and barriers to land management (Nieto-Romero et al. 2016; Nikolakis et al. 2016). Collective action can also produce mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, and incentive systems (IPCC 2014c). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="231.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 231.56; y1: 241.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="231.56" x1="566.09">Successful collective action requires understanding and implementation of factors that determine successful participation in climate adaptation and mitigation (Nkoana et al. 2017).

In a UK study, dynamic trust relations among members around speci&#64257;c issues, determined the potential of agri-environmental schemes to offer landscape-scale environmental protection (Riley et al. 2018).

International environmental&#160;agreements are also increasingly including attention to ILK and diverse cultural perspectives, for reasons of social justice and inclusive decision-making (Brondizio and Tourneau 2016). However, the context-speci&#64257;c, and dynamic nature of ILK and its embeddedness in local institutions and power relations needs consideration (Naess 2013). It is also important to take a&#160;gendered approach so as not to further marginalise certain knowledge, as men and women hold different knowledge, expertise and&#160;transmission patterns (D&#237;az- Reviriego et al. 2017).</span></div></body></html>
