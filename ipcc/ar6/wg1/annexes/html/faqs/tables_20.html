      <td>Yes, climate models have improved and continue to do so, becoming better at capturing complex and small-\nscale processes and at simulating present-day mean climate conditions. This improvement can be measured by\ncomparing climate simulations against historical observations. Both the current and previous generations of\nmodels show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming. While past warming is well simulated by\nthe new generation models as a group, some individual models simulate past warming that is either below or\nabove what is observed.

Climate models perform their calculations on a three-dimensional grid made of small bricks\nor &#8216;gridcells&#8217; of about 100 km across. Processes that occur on scales smaller than the model grid cells (such\nas the transformation of cloud moisture into rain) are treated in a simplified way. This simplification is done\ndifferently in different models. Some models include more processes and complexity than others; some represent\nprocesses in finer detail (smaller grid cells) than others. Hence the simulated climate and climate change vary</td>

The models used\nin the IPCC First Assessment Report published in 1990 correctly reproduced many aspects of climate (FAQ 1.1).\nThe actual evolution of the climate since then has confirmed these early projections, when accounting for the\ndifferences between the simulated scenarios and actual emissions. Models continue to improve and get better\nand better at simulating the large variety of important processes that affect climate. For example, many models\nnow simulate complex interactions between different aspects of the Earth system, such as the uptake of carbon\ndioxide by vegetation on land and by the ocean, and the interaction between clouds and air pollutants. While\nsome models are becoming more comprehensive, others are striving to represent processes at higher resolution,\nfor example to better represent the vortices and swirls in currents responsible for much of the transport of heat</td>
