In Timor Leste, MOKATIL&#8217;s peasant organization members such as UNAER train farmers in leadership and agroecology following V&#237;a Campesina/Paolo Freire methodologies. SPI facilitates School of Agroecology and Seeds field days, and in 2016, hosted an exchange with the Korean Women Peasants Association (KWPA) in Indonesia for cross-cultural knowledge sharing of agroecology, and the struggle for the right to peasants&#8217; seeds. At the Amritabhoomi Centre in the southern State of Karnataka, India, La V&#237;a Campesina hosts agroecology schools to support the growth of young farmers, and in Australia, AFSA commenced Agroecology Workshops hosted by farms in diverse geographical settings across the country in 2021.</p>
