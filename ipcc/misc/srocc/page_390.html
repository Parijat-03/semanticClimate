Climate change is considered to exacerbate land degradation and potentially accelerate it due to heat stress, drought, changes to evapotranspiration rates and biodiversity, as well as a&#160;result of changes to environmental conditions that allow new pests and diseases to thrive (Reed and Stringer 2016). In general terms, the climate (and climate change) can increase human and ecological communities&#8217; sensitivity to land degradation.

If human and ecological communities exposed to climate change and land degradation are sensitive and cannot adapt, they can be considered vulnerable to it; if they are sensitive and can adapt, they can be considered resilient (Reed and Stringer 2016). The impacts of land degradation will vary under a&#160;changing climate, both spatially and temporally, leading some communities and ecosystems to be more vulnerable or more resilient than others under different scenarios. Even within communities, groups such as women and youth are often more vulnerable than others. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="273.85" top="435.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 435.42; y1: 445.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="59.53" y0="435.42" x1="273.85">1.7.1 Relationships between land degradation, climate&#160;change and poverty </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="399.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 399.52; y1: 409.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="399.52" x1="307.59">This section sets out the relationships between land degradation and poverty, and climate change and poverty, leading to inferences about the three-way links between them.

However, studies have not provided robust quantitative assessments of the extent and incidence of poverty within populations affected by land degradation (Barbier and Hochard 2016). Some researchers, for example, Nachtergaele et al. (2011) estimate that&#160;1.5&#160;billion people were dependent upon degraded land to support their livelihoods in 2007, while &gt;42% of the world&#8217;s poor population inhabit degraded areas.

Recent work by Barbier and Hochard (2018) points to biophysical constraints such as poor soils and limited rainfall, which interact to limit land productivity, suggesting that those farming in climatically less-favourable agricultural areas are challenged by poverty. Studies such as those by Coomes et al. (2011), focusing on an area in the Amazon, highlight the importance of the initial conditions of land holding in the dominant (shifting) cultivation system in terms of long-term effects on household poverty and future forest cover, showing that initial land tenure and socio-economic aspects can make some areas less favourable too. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.58" x1="566.11">Much of the qualitative literature is focused on understanding the livelihood and poverty impacts of degradation through a&#160;focus on subsistence agriculture, where farms are small, under traditional or informal tenure and where exposure to environmental (including climate) risks is high (Morton 2007). In these situations, poorer people lack access to assets (&#64257;nancial, social, human, natural and physical) and in the absence of appropriate institutional supports and social protection, this leaves them sensitive and unable to adapt, so a&#160;vicious cycle of poverty and degradation can ensue. To further illustrate the complexity, livelihood assessments often focus on a&#160;single snapshot in time. Livelihoods are dynamic and people alter their livelihood activities and strategies depending on the internal and external stressors to which they are responding (O&#8217;Brien et al. 2004). When certain livelihood activities and strategies are no longer tenable as a&#160;result of land degradation (and may push people into poverty), land degradation can have further effects on issues such as migration (Lee 2009), as people adapt by moving (Section&#160;4.7.3); and may result in con&#64258;ict (Section&#160;4.7.3), as different groups within society compete for scarce resources, sometimes through non-peaceful actions. Both migration and con&#64258;ict can lead to land-use changes elsewhere that further fuel climate change through increased emissions. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="471.61"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 471.61; y1: 481.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="471.61" x1="566.1">Similar challenges as for understanding land degradation&#8211;poverty linkages are experienced in unravelling the relationship between climate change and poverty. A&#160;particular issue in examining climate change&#8211;poverty links relates to the common use of aggregate economic statistics like GDP, as the assets and income of the poor constitute a&#160;minor proportion of national wealth (Hallegatte et al. 2018). Aggregate quantitative measures also fail to capture the distributions of costs and bene&#64257;ts from climate change. Furthermore, people fall into and out of poverty, with climate change being one of many factors affecting these dynamics, through its impacts on livelihoods. Much of the literature on climate change and poverty tends to look backward rather than forward (Skou&#64257;as et al. 2011), providing a&#160;snapshot of current or past relationships (for example, Dell et al. (2009) who examine the relationship between temperature and income (GDP) using cross-sectional data from countries in the Americas). Yet, simulations of future climate change impacts on income or poverty are largely lacking. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="358.87" top="255.63"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.87; y0: 255.63; y1: 265.13; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="255.63" x1="358.87">Noting the </span><span style="x0: 359.06; x1: 361.17; y0: 255.63; y1: 265.13; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="359.06" y0="255.63" x1="420.25">limited evidence </span><span style="x0: 420.44; x1: 423.26; y0: 255.63; y1: 265.13; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="420.44" y0="255.63" x1="566.13">that exists that explicitly focuses on the relationship between land degradation, climate change and poverty, Barbier and Hochard (2018b) suggest that those people living in less-favoured agricultural areas face a&#160;poverty&#8211;environment trap that can result in increased land degradation under climate change conditions.
