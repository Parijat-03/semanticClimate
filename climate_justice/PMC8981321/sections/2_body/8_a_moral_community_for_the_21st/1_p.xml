<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The UK General Medical Council publishes a guiding document called the Duties of a Doctor, widely taken as the gold standard on good clinical care.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It states that &#8216;patients must be able to trust doctors with their lives and health&#8217; and that we must &#8216;take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised&#8217;. How do we reconcile these duties with the scientific consensus that our climate is rapidly approaching a threshold beyond which there will be major and irreversible changes, some of which are already playing out as catastrophic health outcomes globally?</p>
