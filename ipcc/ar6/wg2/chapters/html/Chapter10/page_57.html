A study of climate adaptation in the health sector in Southeast Asia (Gilfillan, 2018) highlights the growing role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Asia-Pacific Regional Forum on Health and Environment, and shows that their mandates and goals could mutually benefit from the institutionalisation of coordination mechanism. An example from the Maldives shows that the 2014 Tsunami, climate change and the risk of extreme weather events have led to the legitimisation of state-led population resettlement programmes. In China, this has occurred through the renaming of previously existing resettlement initiatives as climate adaptation initiatives; however, the efficacy of resettlement as a CCA measure requires further scrutiny (Arnall, 2019). In India, the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change has been instituted in order to enable states to implement adaptation programmes; however, this does not address the question of mainstreaming CCA into designs for development (Prasad and Sud, 2019). This is closely related to the development of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) where the mainstreaming of adaptation within countries has been an important concern. Insights from developing countries indicate </span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.79" top="390.64"><span x0="318.18" y0="390.64" x1="571.79" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 321.0; y0: 390.64; y1: 400.14; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">that there is still much ground to cover. The NAPA of the Maldives prioritises food security, coastal resources and public health, while Nepal has prioritised ecosystem management and public health, and food security, among other concerns (Saito, 2013). Importantly, Bangladesh&#8217;s NAPA has shown that there is potential for &#8216;reflexivity&#8217; in the integration of adaptation objectives with sectoral objectives (Vij et&#160;al., 2018). Conspicuous by their absence are the transboundary- scale adaptation policies in South Asia (Vij et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="569.5" top="282.65"><span x0="318.18" y0="282.65" x1="569.5" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 323.64; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">A distinguishing feature of the case of Japanese apple growers is the co-existence of both top-down and bottom-up adaptation practices. The former pertains to farmers who rely on the support of the cooperative for agricultural support and follow institutional mechanisms. The latter pertains to non-co-op farmers who have been responsible for innovative practices of cultivation such as the shift to peaches and the sale in the market of apples without leaf-picking. Importantly, the non-co-op group also have access to sales channels that may not be accessible to the former owing to their direct interactions with customers, among other factors (Fujisawa and Kobayashi, 2011; Fujisawa et&#160;al., 2015). The significance of this combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches to agricultural adaptation practices may be further sharpened by formulating approaches for Asia and the Pacific region in ways that contribute to the fortification of food security objectives and the idea of co-benefits. This may be carried out by enhancing the ability of farmers to better manage cultivation practices in the context of climatic variability (FAO, 2018d).</span></div><div left="318.18" right="571.76" top="66.68"><span x0="318.18" y0="66.68" x1="571.76" style="x0: 318.18; x1: 322.4; y0: 66.68; y1: 76.18; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There exist numerous barriers to the mainstreaming of CCA measures across Asia.

The government approved BDP 2100 in 2018. Achievement of a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous delta is the aspiration of the delta plan. Ensuring water and food security with economic growth, environmental sustainability, climate resilience, vulnerability reduction to natural hazards and minimising different challenges of the delta through robust, adaptive and integrated strategies, and equitable water governance, are the mission of this mega plan. Under this mission, three higher-level goals and six specific goals have been determined. Three higher-level goals include elimination of extreme poverty by 2030, achievement of upper middle-income status by 2030 and becoming a prosperous country beyond 2041. Six specific goals of BDP 2100 are fully linked with SDG Goals 2, 6, 13 and 14 and partially linked with Goals 1, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15. These specific goals comprise a wide range of issues, including land and water resources, climate change, disaster, wetlands and ecosystems, river systems and estuaries. The vision, mission and goals of BDP 2100 reveal that this mega plan is a holistic and integrated approach considering diversified themes and sectors for the whole country. The implementation of the BDP 2100 requires total spending of an amount of about 2.5% of the GDP per annum. A series of strategies have been formulated for better implementation of the mega plan.</span></div><div left="68.05" right="557.62" top="498.63"><span x0="68.05" y0="498.63" x1="557.62" style="x0: 68.05; x1: 75.62; y0: 498.63; y1: 508.13; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Water is the key and complicated resource of Bangladesh, and therefore BDP 2100 has kept water at the centre of the plan. It aims to promote wise and integrated use of water and other resources through development of effective institutions and equitable governance for in-country and transboundary water resource management.</span></div><div left="68.05" right="557.65" top="450.63"><span x0="68.05" y0="450.63" x1="557.65" style="x0: 68.05; x1: 73.51; y0: 450.63; y1: 460.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Along with water, for the first time in any development planning, BDP 2100 has taken the climate-change issue as an exogenous variable in developing the macroeconomic framework of the plan. In a brief, it is stated that the principle of BDP 2100 is &#8216;Living with Nature&#8217;.</span></div></body></html>
