In the case of Djobel, the main dike structure started to break in a way that made reconstruction impossible. Thus, Djobel's resilience to socio-environmental change and its ability to adapt to and mitigate against extreme weather events started to show major weaknesses. This can be observed in the land cover map of 2007, where large areas of Djobel's previous rice fields are shown flooded and covered in mud (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In 2009, 2014, 2015, and 2016 extremely high and strong tides further destroyed the village contour dike. Despite these events, in 2007 and 2015 there was a small decrease in the mangrove area due to attempts to open some new rice fields, but in 2019, the cultivation area contracted again (see also Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Meanwhile, flooded areas have been progressively covered by mangroves (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>&#160;and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p>
