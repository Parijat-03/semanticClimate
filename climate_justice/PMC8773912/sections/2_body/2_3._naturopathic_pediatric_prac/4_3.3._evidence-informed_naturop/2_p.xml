<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Naturopathic doctors consider each intervention in terms of the available evidence for its safety and efficacy for a particular scenario (<xref rid="children-09-00008-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B32-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A dearth of high-quality evidence is a challenge that affects both naturopathic and pediatric care independently, made worse by the combination. Application to children may need to be extrapolated from literature relevant to adults, and from pediatric studies focusing on safe and effective management of other related conditions if available. During a review of the available literature, clinicians are trained to look for reported adverse events and evidence of tolerability. Since physiologically, metabolically, and behaviorally, children are not just small adults [<xref rid="B33-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], caution should be taken to minimize the risk of harm. NDs are trained to adjust dosing of natural health products to the age and weight of the child [<xref rid="B34-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Leaning toward less invasive or toxic interventions in general minimizes risk. </p>
