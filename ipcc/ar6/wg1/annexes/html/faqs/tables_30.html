As\nthe Arctic warms and soils thaw, the organic matter in these soils begins to decompose rapidly and return to the\natmosphere as either carbon dioxide or methane, which are both important greenhouse gases. Permafrost can\nalso thaw abruptly in a given place, due to melting ice in the ground reshaping Arctic landscapes, lakes growing\nand draining, and fires burning away insulating surface soil layers.

The projections from these permafrost carbon models show\na wide range in the estimated strength of a carbon&#8211;climate vicious circle, from both carbon dioxide and methane,\nequivalent to 14&#8211;175 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide released per 1&#176;C of global warming. By comparison, in\n2019, human activities have released about 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has two\nimplications. First, the extra warming caused by permafrost thawing is strong enough that it must be considered\nwhen estimating the total amount of remaining emissions permitted to stabilize the climate at a given level of\nglobal warming (i.e., the remaining carbon budget, see FAQ 5.4). Second, the models do not identify any one\namount of warming at which permafrost thaw becomes a &#8216;tipping point&#8217; or threshold in the climate system\nthat would lead to a runaway global warming.

      <td>carbon than in the Arctic. For instance, the Tibetan plateau contains about 3% as much carbon as is stored in\nthe Arctic. There is also concern about carbon frozen in shallow ocean sediments. These deposits are known as\nmethane hydrates or clathrates, which are methane molecules locked within a cage of ice molecules. They formed\nas frozen soils that were flooded when sea levels rose after the last ice age. If these hydrates thaw, they may\nrelease methane that can bubble up to the surface. The total amount of carbon in permafrost-associated\nmethane hydrates is much less than the carbon in permafrost soils. Global warming takes millennia to penetrate\ninto the sediments beneath the ocean, which is why these hydrates are still responding to the last deglaciation.\nAs a result, only a small fraction of the existing hydrates could be destabilised during the coming century. Even\nwhen methane is released from hydrates, most of it is expected to be consumed and oxidised into carbon dioxide\nin the ocean before reaching the atmosphere.
