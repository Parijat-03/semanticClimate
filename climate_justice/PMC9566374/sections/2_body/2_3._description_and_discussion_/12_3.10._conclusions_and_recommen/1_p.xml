<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The proposed conceptual framework attempts to explain the relationship between climate change, its causes and consequences and its impact on human health in urban contexts with a Mediterranean climate. The main contribution is the in-depth description of the relationship between climate change and social inequalities in health, attempting to highlight common structural determinants and differential impacts on health by social group. The framework also includes the role of mitigation and adaptation policies and interventions against climate change, highlighting the need to act from the perspective of climate justice and the importance of co-benefits in health that can be provided by such actions. The fight against climate change and its impacts on health must both drive actions, as their combination is essential to provide an immediate response to the public health impacts we are already suffering, as well as avoid or reduce the impacts that are expected in the future.</p>
