The deployment of renewable energy is widely recognised as a crucial measure for enhancing energy access and diversity. There remains huge potential for renewable sources in Asia (i.e., India has massive solar power potential) (Shukla et&#160;al., 2017). Many renewable technologies (i.e., hydro- and wind power as well as solar photovoltaics) are becoming competitive, and their life-cycle costs may fall below those of coal and natural gas in the near term. Great progress has been made in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and in the conventional and unconventional fusion power that China is promoting. Conventional and underground pumped hydropower will level out supplies for intermittent renewable energy generation.</span></div><div left="42.38" right="296.1" top="534.63"><span x0="42.38" y0="534.63" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.38; x1: 46.6; y0: 534.63; y1: 544.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Substantial progress may be fulfilled by increasing the share of renewable energy in the overall energy consumption of Asia (ADB, 2017a). Access to energy, particularly in rural areas, can reduce climate vulnerability of developing Asia. Due to the high cost of extending the electricity network to rural regions, an alternative way is to develop the off-grid renewable energy systems in these areas. The distributed, instead of centralised, energy systems can increase energy access and resilience (EUEI-PDF, 2017).</span></div><div left="42.38" right="296.08" top="426.64"><span x0="42.38" y0="426.64" x1="296.08" style="x0: 42.38; x1: 46.6; y0: 426.64; y1: 436.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Some countries in the Arabian Peninsula, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are adopting an array of approaches to enhance the adaptive capacity of the energy infrastructure and diffuse the risk of climate change over a larger area (e.g., energy efficiency, demand management, storm planning for power plants). In Al Mashrek, building institutional capacity in the energy sector is a necessary first step to mainstream climate-change adaptation (CCA). Countries such as Lebanon and Jordan have already made progress in mainstreaming CCA into electricity infrastructure. In the UAE, buildings account for more than 80% of the total electricity consumption. There are currently a set of measures and regulations on building conditions and specifications that are being applied to increase energy efficiency in buildings, but the rehabilitation and upgrading of old buildings still require further efforts (Environment, 2015). In Kuwait, one adaptation measure to dust storms is through the reduction of the proportion of open-desert land from 75 to 51%, the increase in protected areas from 8 to 18% and greenbelt projects in desert areas (Kuwait, 2015). Addressing climate-change impact on energy systems in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Palestine needs to simultaneously consider other interlinked challenges of population growth, rapid urbanisation, refugee influx, conflict and geopolitical location. To address these challenges and provide solutions for CCA, the promotion of multi- stakeholder partnerships is key to breaking the silo approach.</span></div><div left="42.38" right="296.07" top="138.67"><span x0="42.38" y0="138.67" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.38; x1: 46.6; y0: 138.67; y1: 148.17; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">These CCA measures need to be broadened to fit the scope and depth of mitigation efforts by each country. Risk assessments and vulnerability assessments are in their early stages in the energy and industrial sectors, and are not currently based on a comprehensive plan of action. The first step is to undertake comprehensive national assessments of the risks associated with climate change based on existing studies on climate impacts and risks, and by making evidence- based decisions on adaptation actions.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.27" top="702.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="702.6" x1="560.27" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Sub-regional diversity of ecosystems is high in Asia (Section&#160;10.2.2). Climate-impact drivers of Asian terrestrial ecosystems (ATS) change are global warming, precipitation and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing and extreme events like dust storms. Observed and projected changes in ATS are affected by several interacting factors. Non-climatic human-related drivers are change of land use, change of human use of natural resources, including species and ecosystems overexploitation as well as other non-sustainable use, socioeconomic changes and direct impacts of rising greenhouse gases (GHGs). Ecosystem vulnerability has resulted from complex interactions of CIDs and non-climate drivers. Species interaction and natural variability of organisms, species and ecosystems is currently poorly understood, and much more work still needs to be done to unravel these multiple stressors (i.e., Berner et&#160;al., 2013; Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="413.83" top="522.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="522.48" x1="413.83" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 522.48; y1: 532.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.2.1 Observed Impacts</span></div><div left="306.57" right="454.42" top="498.6"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.13; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.343]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="306.57" y0="498.6" x1="454.42">10.4.2.1.1 Biomes and mountain treeline</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.28" top="474.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="474.6" x1="560.28" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.67; y0: 474.6; y1: 484.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Changes in biomes in Asia are compatible with a response to regional surface air temperature increase (Arias et&#160;al., 2021) (</span><span style="x0: 528.79; x1: 535.65; y0: 462.61; y1: 472.11; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="528.79" y0="462.61" x1="560.27">medium agreement, medium evidence</span><span x0="416.27" y0="450.61" x1="560.27" style="x0: 416.27; x1: 418.91; y0: 450.61; y1: 460.11; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">). Expansion of the boreal forest and reduction of the tundra area is observed for about 60% of latitudinal and altitudinal sites in Siberia (Rees et&#160;al., 2020). In Central Siberia, the changes in climate and disturbance regimes are shifting the southern taiga ecotone northward (Brazhnik et&#160;al., 2017). In Taimyr, no significant changes in the forest boundary have been observed during the past three decades (Pospelova et&#160;al., 2017). For the Japanese archipelago, it is suggested that the change in tree community composition along the temperature gradient is a response to past and/or current climate changes (Suzuki et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.3" top="318.62"><span x0="306.57" y0="318.62" x1="560.3" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.02; y0: 318.62; y1: 328.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Alpine treeline position in Asian mountains in recent decades either moves upwards in North Asia or demonstrates multi-directional shifts in Himalaya (</span><span style="x0: 354.47; x1: 359.04; y0: 294.63; y1: 304.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: CICZFZ+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="354.47" y0="294.63" x1="411.67">high confidence</span><span x0="411.67" y0="294.63" x1="560.31" style="x0: 411.67; x1: 414.32; y0: 294.63; y1: 304.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">).
