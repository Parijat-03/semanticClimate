For example, in 2007&#8211;2009, 46% of OECD support for agriculture was based on measures of output (price support or payments based on yields), 37% of support was based on the current or historical area planted, herd size (or correlated measures of the notional costs of farming), and 13% was payments linked to input prices. In a&#160;similar vein, non-OECD countries have promoted productivity growth for their agricultural sectors. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="349.49" top="423.12"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.29; y0: 423.12; y1: 432.62; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="323.72" y0="423.12" x1="349.49">Trade. </span><span style="x0: 352.6; x1: 358.05; y0: 423.12; y1: 432.62; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="352.6" y0="423.12" x1="571.77">Along with agricultural policy to grow productivity, the development of frameworks to liberalise trade (such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&#160;&#8211; GATT&#160;&#8211; Uruguay Round, now incorporated into the World Trade Organization) have been essential in stimulating the growth of a&#160;globalised food system. Almost every country has a&#160;reliance on trade to fulfil some or all of its local food needs, and trade networks have grown to be highly complex (Puma et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2015; Fader et al. 2013 and Ercsey-Ravasz et al. 2012). This is because many countries lack the capacity to produce sufficient food due to climatic conditions, soil quality, water constraints, and availability of farmland (FAO 2015b). In a&#160;world of liberalised trade, using comparative advantage to maximise production in high-yielding commodities, exporting excess production, and importing supplies of other goods supports economic growth. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.72" top="243.14"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 243.14; y1: 252.64; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="243.14" x1="571.72">City states as well as many small island states, do not have adequate farmland to feed their populations, while Sub-Saharan African countries are projected to experience high population growth as well as to be negatively impacted by climate change, and thus will likely find it difficult to produce all of their own food supplies (Agarwal et al. 2002). One study estimates that some 66 countries are currently incapable of being self-sufficient in food (Pradhan et al. 2014). Estimates of the proportion of people relying on trade for basic food security vary from about 16% to about 22% (Fader et al. 2013; Pradhan et al. 2014), with this figure rising to between&#160;1.5 and 6&#160;billion people by 2050, depending on dietary shifts, agricultural gains, and climate impacts (Pradhan et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="87.16"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.53; y0: 87.16; y1: 96.66; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="87.16" x1="571.76">Global trade is therefore essential for achieving food and nutrition security under climate change because it provides a&#160;mechanism for enhancing the efficiency of supply chains, reducing the vulnerability of </span></div></body></html>
