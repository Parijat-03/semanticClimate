Thus, GHG emissions from agriculture result, in large part, from &#8216;pull&#8217; from the demand side.

In addition to undernourishment in the sense of insuf&#64257;cient calories&#160;(&#8216;hunger&#8217;), undernourishment occurs in terms of nutritional de&#64257;ciencies in vitamins (e.g.,&#160;vitamin&#160;A) and minerals </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.69; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.58" x1="566.1">(e.g.,&#160;iron, zinc, iodine), so-called &#8216;hidden hunger&#8217;. Hidden hunger tends to be present in countries with high levels of undernourishment (Muthayya et al. 2013), but micronutrient de&#64257;ciency can occur in societies with low prevalence of undernourishment. For example, in many parts of the world teenage girls suffer from iron de&#64257;ciency (Whit&#64257;eld et al. 2015) and calcium de&#64257;ciency is common in Western-style diets (Aslam and Varani 2016). Food security is related to nutrition, and conversely food insecurity is related to malnutrition. Not all malnourishment arises from food insecurity, as households may have access to healthy diets but choose to eat unhealthily, or it may arise from illness. However, in many parts of the world, poverty is linked to poor diets (FAO et al. 2018). This may be through lack of resources to produce or access food in general, or healthy food, in particular, as healthier diets are more expensive than diets rich in calories but poor in nutrition </span><span style="x0: 422.52; x1: 425.17; y0: 567.6; y1: 577.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="422.52" y0="567.6" x1="482.06">(high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 482.06; x1: 484.7; y0: 567.6; y1: 577.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="482.06" y0="567.6" x1="566.12">) (see meta-analysis by Darmon and Drewnowski 2015).

For example, the FAO has developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), a&#160;survey-based tool to measure the severity of overall households&#8217; inability to access food. While it provides reliable estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity in a&#160;population, it does not reveal whether actual diets are adequate or not with respect to all aspects of nutrition (Section&#160;5.1.2.1).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="518.24" top="351.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 351.42; y1: 361.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="351.42" x1="518.24">1.1.1.2 Effects of climate change on food security </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="327.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 327.52; y1: 337.02; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="327.52" x1="566.07">Climate change is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of food security&#160;&#8211; availability, access, utilisation and stability&#160;&#8211; and their interactions (FAO et al. 2018) (</span><span style="x0: 425.7; x1: 430.28; y0: 303.53; y1: 313.03; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="425.7" y0="303.53" x1="482.37">high con&#64257;dence</span><span style="x0: 482.37; x1: 485.01; y0: 303.53; y1: 313.03; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="482.37" y0="303.53" x1="566.09">).
