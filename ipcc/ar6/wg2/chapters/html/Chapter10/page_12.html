Beyond monetary measures, indicators of multi-dimensional aspects of poverty, most notably in Southern Asia, indicate that a large share of the population still lacks access to basic infrastructure and services (Bank, 2017b).</span></div><div left="42.37" right="296.08" top="546.61"><span x0="42.37" y0="546.61" x1="296.08" style="x0: 42.37; x1: 46.42; y0: 546.61; y1: 556.11; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">For instance, South Asia illustrates that on average it could lose nearly 2% of its GDP by 2050, rising to a loss of nearly 9% by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014). The relationship between economic outcomes and cross-sectional climate variation is confounded by regional heterogeneity, including historical effects of settlement and colonisation (Dell et&#160;al., 2014; Newell et&#160;al., 2018). Climate change vulnerability may also depend on sufficient employment opportunities in the risk-prone areas, land-holding size, gender, education level, and family and community size, as observed in Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam (Baul and McDonald, 2015; Lebel L., 2015; Phuong et&#160;al., 2018a).</span></div><div left="42.37" right="296.07" top="402.63"><span x0="42.37" y0="402.63" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.37; x1: 47.83; y0: 402.63; y1: 412.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">As poor households are constrained in their ability to receive nutrition, schooling and health care for their children, this is greatly dampening progress in human capital development and productivity growth, both of which are critical imperatives for sustainable development (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Schlenker and Auffhammer, 2018). Studies also have shown negative impacts of climate change on several essential components of people&#8217;s livelihoods and well-being, such as water supply, food production, human health, availability of land and ecosystems (Alauddin and Rahman, 2013; Arnell et&#160;al., 2016; Roy and Haider, 2019).</span></div><div left="42.37" right="296.09" top="270.65"><span x0="42.37" y0="270.65" x1="296.09" style="x0: 42.37; x1: 49.76; y0: 270.65; y1: 280.15; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Major population trends of urbanisation and urban area expansion are forecast to take place in Asia. It has been mentioned that demographic change will make humanity more vulnerable to climate change, particularly in places with high poverty rates and potentially prone to systemic disruptions in the food system (Puma et&#160;al., 2015; d&#8217;Amour et&#160;al., 2016; d&#8217;Amour et&#160;al., 2017).</span></div><div left="42.37" right="296.1" top="186.66"><span x0="42.37" y0="186.66" x1="296.1" style="x0: 42.37; x1: 46.59; y0: 186.66; y1: 196.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">The urban population of the world has grown rapidly from 751&#160;million in 1950 to 4.2&#160;billion in 2018. Asia, despite its relatively lower level of urbanisation, is home to 54% of the world&#8217;s urban population (United Nations, 2019). Some cities have experienced population decline in recent years. Most of these cities are located in the low-fertility countries of Asia, where overall population sizes are stagnant or declining, as observed in a few cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea (e.g., Nagasaki and Busan), which experienced a population decline between 2000 and 2018 (United Nations, 2019).&#160;By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10&#160;million inhabitants, most of them in developing regions.

Challenges with water supply, in many cases, have existed for decades (Dasgupta, 2015). Climate change increases these challenges (Hoque et&#160;al., 2016).

Women are required to acquire new capacities to manage new challenges, including risks from climate change, through capacity-building interventions to strengthen autonomous-adaptation measures (Banerjee et&#160;al., 2019; James, 2019; Mishra, 2019). However, the overlapping crises of climate change and the global public health crisis of COVID-19 represent a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development (Katherine Brickell, 2020; Sultana, 2021).</span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.3" top="402.72"><span x0="306.56" y0="402.72" x1="560.3" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 310.61; y0: 402.72; y1: 412.22; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">For vulnerable populations, such as Indigenous Peoples, older and low-income groups, women, children, people with disabilities and minorities, the health effects of climate-change-related extreme weather events can be especially devastating (McGill, 2016). Such populations may be more susceptible to disease, have pre-existing health conditions or live in areas that do not promote good health or well-being; for instance, loss of income and food supply shortages could lead children in rural households to nutritional deprivations that can have both immediate and lifelong impacts (Gleick, 2014; UNICEF, 2015). Children, already susceptible to age-related insecurities, face additional destabilising insecurities from questions about how they will cope with future climate change (Hansen et&#160;al., 2013).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="534.76" top="233.98"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.81; y0: 233.98; y1: 245.98; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="306.57" y0="233.98" x1="534.76">10.4 Key Systems and Associated Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerabilities</span></div><div left="306.57" right="411.54" top="198.48"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.77; y0: 198.48; y1: 208.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="306.57" y0="198.48" x1="411.54">10.4.1 Energy Systems</span></div><div left="306.57" right="414.38" top="174.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="174.48" x1="414.38" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 174.48; y1: 184.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.4.1.1 Regional Diversity</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.29" top="150.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="150.6" x1="560.29" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.97; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Energy consumption of Asia accounts for 36% of the global total at present. China, India and the ASEAN countries have largely contributed to the ever-growing global energy consumption. Asia is predicted to account for 80% of coal, 26% of natural gas and 52% of electricity consumption of the world by 2040 (IEA, 2018). The share of Asia in the global primary energy consumption will increase to 48% by 2050. China continues to be the world&#8217;s largest energy consumer, and the combined consumption of India and ASEAN will be similar to that of China by that time (IEEJ, 2018).</span></div></body></html>
