Santal norms generally hamper women from inheriting land and they face other normative restrictions as noted by Priyadarshini (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) above. Santal and Muslim women are responsible for house and care work, though, unlike Muslim men, Santal men help their wives from time to time in all tasks except childcare. Women from both communities also farm vegetables around the house, raise cattle and goats, and conduct post-harvest processing of field crops like rice and maize.</p>
