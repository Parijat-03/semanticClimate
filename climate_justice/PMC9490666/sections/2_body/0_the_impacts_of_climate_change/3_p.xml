Children and adolescents are at particular risk of increased anxiety, depression, acute stress, and PTSD associated with climate change.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Communities most at risk of negative health impacts caused by air pollution are those living or working closest to congested roads, fossil fuel industrial sites, and incinerators. In the United States, African Americans, people of Latin American heritage, and young people are disproportionately exposed to poor air quality.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In low and middle income countries (LMICs) people&#8217;s health is also often at risk from burning fuels indoors. Economic hardship exacerbated by climate change is most likely to affect people who are already poor and marginalized or who rely on economies that are threatened, such as smallholder farmers. Disruptions in the aftermath of extreme weather events are associated with increased violence against women, girls, and other vulnerable people.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Additionally, climate change disproportionately disadvantages young people; it has been predicted that children born in 2020 will experience 2- to 7-fold more extreme weather events than those born in 1960.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
