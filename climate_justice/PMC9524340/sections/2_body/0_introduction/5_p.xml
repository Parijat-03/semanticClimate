We conduct a content analysis of the most recent climate mitigation plans developed by the 100 largest cities in the US and provide a comprehensive assessment of the degree to which cities are attentive to justice in climate action planning. We find that the recognition of cities&#8217;&#160;historical patterns of racial segregation, disinvestment, environmental injustice, and exclusion is becoming more common in recent plans, although attention to justice is not equally distributed across mitigation sectors. We highlight local factors that may influence cities&#8217; level of engagement with justice in their climate action plans and uncover four concrete policy tools cities are using to implement and evaluate work toward &#8220;just urban transitions&#8221;.</p>
