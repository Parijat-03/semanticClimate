<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The schools analysed here are not one institution, but rather an assemblage of
diverse pedagogic experiences. They are run by HIC members, friends and allies in
Latin America, and each school has a high degree of autonomy. Their pedagogic
practices are encapsulated in formative processes: in the building of cooperative
housing movements in Uruguay, and the capacity-building of Colombian taxi driver
associations to become inclusive in their work with people with disabilities; in the
learning encounters between Indigenous populations and low-income communities in San
Mart&#237;n de los Andes in Argentina, and the reclaiming of bodies and public spaces
from a feminist perspective in C&#243;rdoba, Argentina, to name a few. Despite their
diversity, the schools have in common the political parity of learners and
pedagogues (who include community leaders, cooperative members, youth, women&#8217;s
groups and local government officials, among others), as well as a commitment to
horizontal, counter-hegemonic learning to act in advancing struggles through popular
urbanism.<sup>(<xref rid="fn3-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">3</xref>)</sup></p>
