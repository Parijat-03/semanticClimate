<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0045">Typically, with most tropical and temperate mosquito species, elevated temperatures allow vector populations to increase their growth and reproduction rates, which in turn decreases blood meals intervals, accelerating transmission and virus evolution rates <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, increasingly warmer winters allow mosquito vectors to expand their breeding seasons and survive during winter, either as eggs or as overwintering female mosquitoes. Weather conditions and climatic factors can also affect vector competence <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Viral replication rates and transmission of WNV are modulated by ambient temperature, affecting the length of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), seasonal phenology of mosquito host populations and also times at which humans and mosquitoes come into contact <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Generally, higher rainfall in warmer weather can lead to higher mosquito abundance and disease transmission by increasing the potential habitat suitable for mosquito reproduction, e.g. standing water <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Conversely, sometimes drought and shrinking water resources can also bring some species into closer contact, facilitating transmission and amplification of WNV within these locations <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To represent these points in our data-set/model, we selected mean winter temperature, mean summer temperature, number of days of rainfall in summer and summer surface water extent (a count of the number of satellite surface water observations per region represented as pixels in a geographic raster layer).</p>
