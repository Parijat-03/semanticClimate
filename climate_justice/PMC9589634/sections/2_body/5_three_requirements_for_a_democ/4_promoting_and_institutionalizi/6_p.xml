In the climate crisis, mini-publics could still have anticipatory functions. Although a majority of the population regards climate change as a pressing problem, opinions on strategies to combat it so far seem insufficiently formed. Given that the group of those willing to take the necessary radical steps to limit emissions still constitutes a minority position, contestatory uses of mini-publics in public discourses will also be important. If growing support for radical measures is not met with respective policies and congruence between public opinion and climate policy-making is lost, mini-publics may also become vigilant. If and when mini-publics become vigilant and receive resonance from a broader public sphere, they also highlight biases and shortcomings of the political system as such and indicate where decision-making is insufficiently responsive to at least some relevant concerns&#8212;such as climate change. From here, they can also spark larger-scale meta-deliberative discourses on institutional reforms that could improve democracies&#8217; capacity to address pressing problems without neglecting its promise of egalitarian self-government.</p>
