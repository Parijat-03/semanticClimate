[<xref rid="B39-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] also demonstrated the possibility of generating remotely sensed data over an agricultural field, using a UAV that had a relatively cheap narrowband and thermal multispectral imaging sensors of 20 cm and 40 cm resolutions, respectively. The system gave rise to surface reflectance and temperature data, after adapting MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction. Biophysical parameter estimation was carried out using a number of vegetation indices, leading to the production and validation of chlorophyll content, detection of water stress from PRI index, as well as the temperature of the canopy. These results showed that the system yielded the same results as the conventional, expensive, and risky manned airborne sensors. </p>
