In the run-up to Paris, China launched a series of intensive bilateral diplomacy with major players from the South and North as well as multilateral diplomacy within the BASIC group, the G77/China and the Like-Minded developing countries group to push different sides to converge on the common ground in specific issues such as climate finance and the differentiation framework (Wu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>). In particular, it was China and the USA that played a pivotal role in securing the Paris Agreement (Kastner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>; Schreurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>; Tiberghien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2018</xref>). An EU high-level climate advisor argues that &#8216;China is kind of a bridge between several worlds&#8217; and &#8216;also playing a big role as a strong link with many parts of the world either through negotiating groups or loose alliances&#8217; (Interview 2018). In addition, China also proactively promoted climate change into other international multilateral institutions such as G20&#8217;s Hangzhou Summit in 2016, where China and the USA announced the plans to ratify the Paris Agreement.</p>
