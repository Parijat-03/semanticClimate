It appears in the moving ships, their routes, and the terminals that serve them. However, infrastructures also affect cognitive and physical perceptions, which form a&#160;substantial part of everyday organization and routine (Star <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1999</xref>: 380). Therefore, while cruise infrastructures make people move, they also interact with infrastructures of the everyday and with symbolic places of the city, like the <italic>Stazione Marittima, </italic>the former commercial heart of the island. There, the Venice Passenger Terminal (VTP) was founded by the Port of Venice in 1997, whose expansion has been planned ever since. Seven former warehouses were restructured and a&#160;number of terminals were newly constructed. The <italic>Marittima</italic> can accommodate up to nine vessels at a&#160;time, and the cruise season has been steadily expanding. The Covid-19 pandemic and specifically the political ban on large ships in August 2021 put an end to this development, and the terminals remain mostly inactive up to now.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn17">17</xref> Since the area is completely fenced off, the cruise terminals are literally isolated from their urban surroundings and not accessible for anyone. During the years in use, the terminals created the link between the ship and the place it visited. At the same time, the ship remained isolated. This situation created both a&#160;visual and material detachment of business from city (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>One of the terminals of the <italic>Stazione Marittima</italic>, former central cruise terminal, 2020 ( photo by Janine Schemmer)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="48_2022_340_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e769"/></fig></p>
