Moreover, these phenomena can lead to higher pollen counts and longer pollen seasons, increasing its allergenicity [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Air quality is also affected by two more phenomena. On the one hand, most sources of GHG emissions also emit air contaminants, not only NO<sub>2</sub>, but also inhalable particulate matter (PM). Many cities with Mediterranean climates, such as Barcelona or Rome, already have high levels of air pollution, mainly due to road traffic [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. On the other hand, in the Mediterranean basin, some areas intermittently receive intrusions of Saharan dust, which in periods of anticyclones and without rainfall can markedly increase the PM pollution already generated by human activity [<xref rid="B66-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
