Chinese stimulus spending has been conservatively estimated at $731 billion (Vivid Economics/F4B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021b</xref>, 38). Much of the funding has gone to the carbon-intensive industrial sector, while car subsidies have generally not been conditioned on environmental performance (Ibid, 38&#8211;39). More positively, stimulus plans have included focus on investment in &#8216;new infrastructure&#8217;, such as 5G (Xu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020</xref>). However, in June 2020, it was reported that over 40GW of new coal capacity had been approved in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">China</xref> in the year-to-date&#8212;a greater amount than was approved in 2018 and 2019 combined (Hale and Hook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>).</p>
