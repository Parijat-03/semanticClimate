The NAP (National Adaptation Plan) is a government-led process, established in Nepal after the COP 2010 in Cancun, to facilitate the planning and implementation of sustainable medium- and long-term adaptation programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In 2016, Nepal ratified the Paris Climate agreement and its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and implemented the H-NAP, the health component of the NAP, guided by the &#8220;WHO operational framework for building climate resilient health systems&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, by signing the Male Declaration at the 70th WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia in 2017, along with the other 10 member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region, Nepal made a regional commitment to building a climate change resilient health system. Nepal is involved in regional projects such as &#8220;Delivering climate-resilient water and sanitation in Africa and Asia&#8221;, and &#8220;Building resilience of health systems in Asian LDCs (least-developed countries) to climate change&#8221;. National capacity building is key for adaptation and developing resilience to climate change through implementation of climate resilient health systems and increasing capacity for disaster preparedness and response.</p>
