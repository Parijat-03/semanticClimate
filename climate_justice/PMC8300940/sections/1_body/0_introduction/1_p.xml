Since then, countries have implemented strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and allocated funds and resources to combating climate change (<xref rid="icab025-B43" ref-type="bibr">Eskander and Fankhauser 2020</xref>). However, the burden to act does not fall solely on federal, state, and provincial governments. As scientists, we can advance the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goals in our own scientific and applied fields by examining how we may lessen the current impact of our study population on the climate (&#8220;mitigation strategies&#8221;) and how we may lessen the harmful effects of impending climate outcomes on our study population (&#8220;adaptation strategies&#8221;; <xref rid="icab025-B53" ref-type="bibr">Grafakos et al. 2019</xref>). The intersection of global climate change and companion animal&#8211;human interaction, and its application, has yet to be seriously addressed (<xref rid="icab025-B139" ref-type="bibr">Stephen et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
