They developed a series of concepts to aid understanding of uneven mobilities, such as &#8216;motility&#8217;, or the capacity to become mobile (<xref rid="bb1000" ref-type="bibr">Kaufmann, 2002</xref>), and analysed the multiple ways in which discourses legitimise and normalise uneven mobilities (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Sheller, 2018a</xref>). They proposed to consider such mobilities in terms of uneven experiences; access to infrastructure; materialities; subject formation; and events and processes of moving, passing, stopping, pausing and waiting (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Sheller, 2018a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Adey et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
