<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0020">We start from the belief that the arrogance of ignorance is ubiquitous. Greed, anti-intellectualism, and anti-science sentiment continue to fuel this ignorance. Poor policy decisions, not based on science but on political or economic expediency, result from this ignorance. It can be traced to many countries and many situations. It is redolent of our experience with&#160;the COVID-19 crisis and of our approach&#8212;so far&#8212;to climate shocks.</p>
