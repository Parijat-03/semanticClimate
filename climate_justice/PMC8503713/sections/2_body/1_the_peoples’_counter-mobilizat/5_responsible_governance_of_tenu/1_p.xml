The President of the Republic of Indonesia then directed his government to accelerate the resolution of agrarian conflicts.

In Timor Leste, UNAER has one of the strongest political voices for farmers and is an active participant in MOKATIL (Timor Leste&#8217;s La V&#237;a Campesina representative).
