From the standpoint of &#8220;energy democracy&#8221; (Greenberg &amp; McKendry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>), public power is clearly preferable. However, when it comes to renewable portfolios, public power&#8217;s track record is less clear (Romankiewicz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>). Although more research is needed to further specify conditions for utilities&#8217; <italic>support</italic> of effective climate policies, it is clear that utilities are a powerful source of obstruction in many cases. For example, at the enforcement and implementation stages, utilities often dominate public utility/service commission rulings (e.g., Stokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2020</xref>).</p>
