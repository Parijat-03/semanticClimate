The EU has developed a broad range of financial tools, e.g. pioneering both emissions trading and green bonds. China, with its bank-dominated financial system (Walter and Howie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>, 27ff), has long been more reliant on green credit. However, since the introduction of the &#8216;Green Financial System&#8217; framework, China has been expanding its toolkit to include instruments such as carbon trading and green bonds. Both jurisdictions are deepening the procedural justice element transparency through reporting and disclosure requirements. Both the ECB and PBoC are planning to further integrate climate considerations into their macroprudential regulation. China and the EU are also working to identify common green finance standards, with the Chinese side expecting these to be finalised by the end of 2021 (Wang and Luo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2021</xref>). While it is unrealistic to expect full convergence between such different systems, these developments indicate the potential for China and the EU to both further bilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of transnational standards aligned to the Article 2.1c goal.</p>
