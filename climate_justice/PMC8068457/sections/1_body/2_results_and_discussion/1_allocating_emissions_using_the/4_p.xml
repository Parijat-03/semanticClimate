Responsibilities from Annex I and non-Annex I countries are clearly differentiated. In the historical period considered, Mediterranean Annex I countries, in which 56% of the region&#8217;s population is concentrated, have been responsible for 70% of the emissions. In contrast, the non-Annex I group, with 44% of the population, has been responsible for 30% of the emissions. This confirms that the historical distribution of the Mediterranean emissions has not been egalitarian. For this reason, when the MCJ is used to calculate the distribution of future emissions, this situation is reversed. It should also be taken into account that according to the UNDESA prospects, in 2100, the population of non-Annex I countries will increase by 81% while the population of Annex I countries will decrease by 13% with respect to 2017. This significantly changes the population distribution between these two groups, with non-Annex I countries hosting 57% of the Mediterranean population (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and this affects the distribution of emissions made by the MCJ when it applies the principle of equality.
