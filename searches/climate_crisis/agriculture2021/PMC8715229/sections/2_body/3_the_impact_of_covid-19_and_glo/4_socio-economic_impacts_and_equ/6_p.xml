<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0285">The pandemic underlines the importance of having secure access to basic services. A large proportion of the global population still lacks access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and this is known to exacerbate food security challenges (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2019</xref>). Chronic dehydration or exposure to water-borne pathogens exacerbate undernutrition and childhood stunting. Lack of water and sanitation access in crowded and unsanitary environments also facilitates the spread of the COVID-19 among poor and vulnerable people.</p>
