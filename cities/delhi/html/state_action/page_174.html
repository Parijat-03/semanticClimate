Another two plants for generation of energy from municipal waste have been set up at Gazipur &amp; Bawana. Both the plants are under trail run. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.19" top="714.63"><span x0="72.02" y0="714.63" x1="526.19" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.69; y0: 714.63; y1: 726.63; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Open 'dhalao' (masonry built dust bin) is still the major receptacle for municipal solid waste in Delhi. These lead to two-fold problems &#8211; exposure of the waste to the environment and multiple handling (from depositing of the garbage to its loading on to the waiting collection vehicle &#8211; whether manually or by a frontend loader and again un-loading at the landfill unless the transporting vehicle is tipping type). </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.42" top="625.35"><span x0="72.02" y0="625.35" x1="526.42" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 625.35; y1: 637.35; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">The private operators are using smaller bins with lids (plastics or FRP made) and dumper placer containers, where the above mentioned problems are under control. However most of the dumper containers are not covered, leading to environmental pollution. Open vehicles are being used for transporting the waste across busy roads in majority of the cases, which needs to be controlled in a planned way. Putting a dangling tarpaulin over the open truck of garbage is no solution. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.03" top="520.08"><span x0="72.02" y0="520.08" x1="526.03" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 78.7; y0: 520.08; y1: 532.08; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Processing and disposal of municipal garbage is the most crucial issue. The existing landfills (dump-sites) are almost full. They need to be closed immediately in a scientific manner to the extent possible and new sanitary landfill (SLF) sites need to be developed and commissioned at the earliest possible. The major constraints in this are: </span></div><div left="90.02" right="95.54" top="445.8"><span x0="90.02" y0="445.8" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 445.8; y1: 457.8; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="445.8" x1="405.67" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 114.69; y0: 445.8; y1: 457.8; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Provision of adequate land for building new sanitary landfills </span></div><div left="90.02" right="95.54" top="428.98"><span x0="90.02" y0="428.98" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 428.98; y1: 440.98; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="428.98" x1="526.17" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 115.35; y0: 428.98; y1: 440.98; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">To make arrangement for disposal of the waste in the intervening period before the new SLFs can receive waste </span><span x0="90.02" y0="396.46" x1="95.54" style="x0: 90.02; x1: 95.54; y0: 396.46; y1: 408.46; width: 5.52; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Symbol;">&#61623;</span><span x0="108.02" y0="396.46" x1="526.31" style="x0: 108.02; x1: 116.68; y0: 396.46; y1: 408.46; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">UD Department is in the process of finalizing the bye-laws and Solid Waste Management Action Plan for Delhi. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="182.3" top="348.82"><span x0="72.02" y0="348.82" x1="182.3" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 348.82; y1: 360.82; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Bio Medical Waste: </span><span x0="185.66" y0="348.82" x1="526.19" style="x0: 185.66; x1: 193.66; y0: 348.82; y1: 360.82; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Bio-medical waste means any waste, which generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human being or animals or in research activities and is governed by the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. The prescribed authority for implementation of these rules is DPCC. Department of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Department of Animal Husbandary and the Urban Local Bodies as per schedule III of the rules.  GNCTD in its notification dated 6th July, 1999 has authorized Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to grant authorization for collection, reception, storage, treatment and disposal of bio medical waste. To implement the Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 1998, GNCTD has also constituted an Advisory Committee and an Appellate Authority, in exercise of powers conferred under Bio Medical Rules. With the increase in the number of hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi, hospital waste has become another area of concern. In-house waste treatment facilities in terms of autoclave/ incinerators / shredders are available in major hospitals. While in small nursing homes, clinics and dispensaries are disposing off the waste through 'Operator of facility' who collects, treat, transport and dispose of the waste.  </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.41" top="110.71"><span x0="72.02" y0="110.71" x1="526.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 110.71; y1: 122.71; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are about 2,070 Health Care establishment in Delhi as of March, 2018.
