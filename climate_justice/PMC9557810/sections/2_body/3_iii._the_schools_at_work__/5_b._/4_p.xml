multiple and most deeply realized through the way it advances epistemic justice
&#8211; not just by including typically marginalized <italic toggle="yes">saberes</italic> but,
more deeply, by awakening new ways of making sense of the world from our senses,
affections and positionalities. This critical pedagogy practice adopts feminist
and decolonial thought, insisting on the plurality of knowledges, to acknowledge
the diverse points of departure and inequalities that, as argued by De Jong and
colleagues: <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;emerge from the intersections of race/ethnicity, class,
gender, sexual orientation, age, body ableness and so

importance of situating the present in historical perspective in order to unveil
the roots of different forms of oppression.</p>
