Using human-centered artificial intelligence and citizen science, the platform improves engagement continuously by refining the app based on citizen input. As engagement will depend on behaviors, emotions, expectations, and perceptions of the citizens, human-centered artificial intelligence will develop solutions that will capture the context and intention of these factors to further human-machine (app) interactions. For example, if a particular citizen is engaging more during the early morning due to their work schedule, the platform will develop algorithms to engage that citizen in the morning. This approach will enhance evidence-based engagement, improve the reliability and validity of artificial intelligence algorithms, and continuously refine the product codeveloped with citizens.</p>
