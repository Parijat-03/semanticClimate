<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Crude models showed that the associations between COVID-19 incidence rate and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were statistically significant. Multivariate models confirmed these associations even after adjusting by confounders. For each microgram per cubic meter, the incidence rate increased by 1.2% regarding PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 0.9% regarding PM<sub>10</sub>. Other variables were also associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate. For example, the percentage of houses with moderate overcrowding and relative humidity were directly associated with incidence, whereas the elderly index was inversely associated with this outcome (<xref rid="ijerph-18-07409-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
