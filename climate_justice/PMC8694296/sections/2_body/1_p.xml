<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report detailed the harsh differences in climate change likely to result from moving above 1.5&#176;C, including increases in mean temperature in most land and sea regions, hot extremes in most inhabited regions, heavy precipitation, and probably droughts in other regions.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It also outlined the detrimental impacts on low-lying cities and coastal areas, on food production, and on most essential systems, including health systems, of a 2.0&#176;C (compared to 1.5&#176;C) increase. Further, it demonstrated the extra hardship that the added 0.5&#176;C would mean for vulnerable and poor communities. But still, COP26 was unable to convince its member parties to transition away from fossil fuels quickly enough to save lives, livelihoods, and, in the case of small island states, entire nations. India and China both fought against &#8220;cutting out&#8221; the use of fossil fuels. Instead, they opted for the soft language of &#8220;phasing down&#8221; coal-fired power plants.</p>
