By definition this contribution depends on the lifetime, the\nwarming/cooling potential (radiative efficiency), and the emissions of each compound in the atmosphere. Blue indicates cooling and orange indicates warming.\nNote that, between 1750 and 2019, the cooling contribution from aerosols (blue diamonds and globe) was approximately half the warming contribution from\ncarbon dioxide.</td>
