<h1 id="management-session">management session</h1>
<p>PMR:Captions beautiful transcript.</p>
<p>PMR:And off we go. So.</p>
<h2 id="extension-for-submission">extension for submission</h2>
<p>PMR:It’s possible that Shweata might join us today as well. we’ll see.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. Right. Okay. So, we are going to find it very difficult to meet the deadline for the end of tomorrow, Thursday.</p>
<p>PMR:So I’ve written to Gita and Usha</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:04:30 So you got the email also. You got the answer response from the Usha.</p>
<p>PMR:Have I? What?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:04:37 Yes, she said you can go ahead with the one week extension I think.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, that’s magnificent. Okay. So, So we’ve been very ambitious.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:04:45 Yes.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:04:54 Yeah, it’s say it is saying that you may take a week and submit the final version by 27th with references as per, Yeah.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. Okay, that’s absolutely great. Okay, well, I will need everybody’s help.</p>
<p>PMR:And is everybody, prepared to work? Very hard over the next week to make this happen.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:05:21 Hmm, yes.</p>
<h2 id="tidy-material">tidy material</h2>
<p>PMR:What we’re going to, what we’re going to do is we’re going to need to tidy a lot of things.</p>
<p>PMR:So We’ve got the material here. And, What we need to do is to make it, read well, and then package it all together.</p>
<h2 id="volunteers">volunteers</h2>
<p>PMR:So I’m going to need people who will edit. Various parts of this. I’ll explain what we want to do.</p>
<h2 id="mission">mission</h2>
<p>PMR:And then, I will come back and ask for volunteers. Right, okay. So basically the.</p>
<p>PMR:Scheme of this is that we are going to show the creation of semantic documents. That’s the key.</p>
<p>PMR:Theme here. And we’re going to start off with. 1st of all, why? So we’ve done a lot of that.</p>
<p>PMR:And that’s mainly, as, sessions about ranganathan about state of scholarly publishing and things like that.</p>
<p>[Parijat Bhadra] 09:06:29 Thanks.</p>
<h2 id="documents">documents</h2>
<p>PMR:And so that will be the introduction. Then we are going to talk about our documents. And, we’re going to concentrate on the, IPCC material.</p>
<p>PMR:That’s, the chapters. The. And the chapters the.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, sorry. And mentioned the UN FCC. But what we’re going to need to do is to put in.</p>
<p>PMR:Hi, per links to all of this so people can see it and snapshots of screens and things like that.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so we’ve got a huge amount. What we’re really doing is we’re writing.</p>
<p>PMR:The documentation of the system. Does that make sense to everybody?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:07:29 Yes, we do.</p>
<p>PMR:Good. Okay, so. So.</p>
<p>PMR:Think of it that way.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s going to be for most people finding some pages which we will point you out possibly taking a snapshot and writing a short bit of text about what it means, that sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">tasks</h2>
<p>PMR:Okay, we’re then going to talk about our communication tools and here I’m going to, hand out various tasks.</p>
<p>PMR:So for example, what does slack look like? What does zoom look like? What does GitHub look like.</p>
<p>PMR:And here I think, doing some screenshots. Will be a valuable thing to do so so we’ll think about that.</p>
<p>PMR:And we’ve already talked about those. Then, we’ll have a short this is not necessarily in the right order but we’ll have a short session on narratives and how we do the narratives and in particular how we turn them into marked down.</p>
<p>PMR:Then we will talk about, How code repository. So we will talk, and this is Just Amy Lib and Amy climate right so So.</p>
<p>PMR:I thought I would probably. Do some of that today. And then we’ve got to do some figures for this.</p>
<p>PMR:And, I’m going to make a list of figures. That we should do.</p>
<p>PMR:Have you all cloned the report, the sub repository, A list 2 0 2 4.</p>
<p>PMR:From GitHub.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:09:54 Yeah.</p>
<p>PMR:The order I’ve got on the screen at the moment is, so.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:10:05 Bye.</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 09:10:07 Yes.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, Oh, we’ve got lots of people. I need to put it. I need to put it on gallery.</p>
<p>PMR:By the way, it is absolutely fantastic having you all here. And it’s Just such a major resource.</p>
<p>PMR:So. So I want, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 yeses from people.</p>
<p>PMR:Has everybody cloned the alis2024.</p>
<p>PMR:Directory from. From the ptrmar semantic climate</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:10:50 You can show the directory and then, we can go there.</p>
<h2 id="directory">directory</h2>
<p>PMR:I good point right absolutely So, right. So here we’ve got it. Can you see?</p>
<p>PMR:Can everybody see the screen?</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 09:11:03 Yes, Peter.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. This is where we’re putting our material together. So it’s under my repository semantic climate peter MR semantic climate Sub directory and is to to form.</p>
<p>PMR:And then these are, Some of the things here we’ve got a repository for figures.</p>
<p>PMR:Don’t worry about this. We’ve got a zoom repository of, here.</p>
<p>PMR:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1011 sessions.</p>
<p>PMR:And these are archetypal sessions. That, that we’ve done.</p>
<p>PMR:Now some of these maybe, what we will need from some of these is the,</p>
<p>PMR:It’s the video as well because although we’ve got the audio and it’s looking good, we need the video, for this.</p>
<h2 id="video-storage">video storage</h2>
<p>PMR:So, We’re going to need to convert this video. Has anybody used hand brake?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:12:18 No, for words, for what it can be used.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay. It’s for a compressing videos. So let me show you. And break.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s a very strange name. It has a pineapple. And what it is is it takes videos and it’s reduces the size of them.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:12:49 Hmm.</p>
<p>PMR:So. The MP 4 that we get off GitHub. Much larger than they need to be.</p>
<p>PMR:And, what handbreak does, is goes through and compresses them without loss.</p>
<p>PMR:So, it’s just cleverer than, the MP 4. At the moment is anybody who’s particularly interested in videos.</p>
<p>PMR:You see, last time we had. last time we had Shubham, didn’t we?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:13:40 So, Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:So, has anybody edited a video?</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:13:51 So I think that, Windows has Microsoft Click Ch which is an in-house tool to edit videos.</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:14:00 So I probably think that. We could use that as well too. Compress videos if it is needed.</p>
<p>PMR:That’s, that sounds, that sounds a great idea. Now, So have you used it or not?</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:14:18 Yeah, I have used it, but not specifically to, sorry, compress videos. I’ve used it.</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:14:25 To edit videos and subtitles and stuff. Yes.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. So what I want to do, is to show how we work as a team. And so here, for example, some of what we’ve got on the, screen is valuable.</p>
<p>PMR:We’ve got ourselves and then we’ve got a picture of handbreak so this particular bit could be a clip on this sort of thing And the main problem I have is that The videos are too large at the moment to, upload to GitHub.</p>
<p>PMR:Let me just see how big they are.</p>
<p>PMR:Typical.</p>
<p>PMR:Video here.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:15:27 If someone, if someone can flip it in the sections of the different different sessions of the different different sessions so I can convert into the and then we can show the link to there.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:15:40 Hello.</p>
<p>PMR:So, so this is a hundred 64. Let, let me just see how big these ones are.</p>
<h1 id="video-sizes">video sizes</h1>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:15:51 And.</p>
<p>PMR:2 50.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:15:57 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:1 43.</p>
<p>PMR:1 90.</p>
<p>PMR:106 they’re not actually as big as i thought because a lot of them 2 40.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:16:15 But it’s in the MD,</p>
<p>PMR:4</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:16:19 Yeah. Bye. If that’s the case, then we could. We might as well upload these on YouTube instead.</p>
<p>PMR:No.</p>
<p>PMR:Let’s, let’s put, let’s put it, so the point is they’re on my machine at the moment, right?</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:16:41 Yeah.</p>
<h1 id="posting-videos">posting videos</h1>
<p>PMR:Now is there a way to get them Easily to you.</p>
<p>PMR:I’m, yes, these are not too bad.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:17:00 Peter Sweta is here.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:17:10 Okay. Good morning.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, okay, well, thanks very much indeed. The good news is we’ve got an extension of a week, right, okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:17:15 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:And what we’re doing now is we are, pulling together the.</p>
<p>PMR:The theme for this. And article. And we’re also trying to look for volunteers to come up with, different subtasks.</p>
<p>PMR:That they can manage. Right, okay. And one of the things that we’re talking about at the moment is how do we get, the videos of our sessions.</p>
<p>PMR:To people so they can edit them and make clips of them, and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:And And</p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google drive</h3>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:18:13 You can upload it to Google Drive, Peter, should be straightforward.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, okay. We’ve got 11 here, upload them to Google Drive. That’s, and can everybody see them on Google Drive?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:18:19 Yeah.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:18:26 Yeah, I mean you have to give the access to people but if you make it just like it’s Similar to how Google Docs would work, you just have to say anyone with the link in mu, edit.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:18:38 I’ll call me</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, that is brilliant. You see, this is why we’re a team, right? Because different people have got different solutions.</p>
<p>PMR:So that’s really good. What I want to do, and what we want to do is to compress these videos right so i’ve been using an open source tool called handbreak nitika has said that she can use Microsoft click did you say</p>
<p>PMR:Hi, Microsoft something anyway. So if we can get them to Nitika, that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, so, let’s. See if we can get these 11. Directories.</p>
<p>PMR:And onto Google Drive. So.</p>
<p>PMR:Huh.</p>
<p>PMR:So I go to drive, is that right? Hi. The files are not so what do I do do can I make a folder</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:19:51 So you have to click on new and then say you would want to make a new folder.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes, and we will call this. ALS, 24 video. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, create.</p>
<p>PMR:Where is it?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:20:21 Okay. It’s the last one about Nimr. It</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, there it is. Okay. And now I do that. And presumably it’s a way.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:20:31 Just just double click on it and you get into the folder.</p>
<p>PMR:Right and I could have spent. Weeks doing this, okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:20:39 And now you drag all the videos into this particular folder.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:01 I’m guessing it will take up a substantial amount of your storage because Google Drive allows you to have 15 GB.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:09 Maximum.</p>
<p>PMR:I think I pay for extra.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:14 Okay, then we don’t have to worry.</p>
<p>PMR:Anyway, that’s absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:20 And now what you do is, you can immediately share the Google Drive link. So if you click on areas 2024 video.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:28 On top.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:31 Yeah, just click on share, make sure it’s</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:36 Yeah, click on share again, on towards your left side.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:42 Yeah. Just give it. Yeah, change the access. Yeah.</p>
<p>PMR:People, I, I, anyone with the link, okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:21:50 Copy the link.</p>
<p>PMR:Copy the link. Okay, yes. Then copy it down. Right, so I’ll put that back in.</p>
<p>PMR:So this is.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s a n.</p>
<p>PMR:Good. Oh, excellent. And, so Nitika, if you can look after that, what we want, I think is probably a good idea to, compress them all, at the following time because that will make it, easier for everybody and it doesn’t lose any information.</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:23:19 Hi.</p>
<p>PMR:So, so, Unitica. In charge of, the videos, right? I mean, you can get help from people and so on, but, you are the, the manager for the videos that’s tremendous okay Right.</p>
<p>PMR:What we will need from the videos is we’ll probably need clips. so let me go back and explain what we’ve got in the directory.</p>
<p>PMR:A directory has been put up to github apart from the videos. So.</p>
<p>PMR:So I have We’ve got literally You know, we probably got a hundred recorded sessions. Even just this year i mean there’s a huge amount of recorded stuff on you know on my machine but I’ve picked out.</p>
<p>PMR:About</p>
<h2 id="allocating-tasks">allocating tasks</h2>
<p>PMR:I’ve got 9 this has got slightly more not quite sure what the 1st 3 are. And this is doing a little bit from memory and this is in this is in,</p>
<p>PMR:Date order. So, this one climate is talking about the climate crisis. And there’s also at the end of it, a mention of tools, something of that sort.</p>
<p>PMR:That was, whatever it was, oh, 2 weeks ago, okay. The next one here open note and semantic talks about the idea of open notebook and I should say that open notebook is going to be a very considerable theme.</p>
<h2 id="open-notebook">open notebook</h2>
<p>PMR:Of this. And, it’s an opportunity for us to try and get across this idea of capturing things immediately.</p>
<p>PMR:And our goal is that we want to make everything available to the world. But that, the technology is.</p>
<p>PMR:Has got a lot of friction in it. So what we’re doing here is we are. Trying to show how this would work in a frictionless system.</p>
<p>PMR:So, you know, we’ve overcome a little bit of friction here if we use Google Drive, it becomes easier to share.</p>
<p>PMR:Material here. Probably easier than GitHub, but we’re using GitHub because we’ve started with it.</p>
<p>PMR:And the other thing is that GitHub is, if you like in the real world, it’s on a site you can download it and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:Whereas Google Drive is in the cloud. And that makes it at least psychologically harder to get at.</p>
<p>PMR:I mean, I, I don’t like, these cloud drives because it’s harder to find out what’s there.</p>
<p>PMR:And they often don’t have a very clear. Directory structure whereas GitHub has a very clear, directory structure and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:There’s a lot of And. There’s lots of psychology if you like in what is the best way.</p>
<p>PMR:Of doing this and it differs for different people. So, then, we had so that’s open notebook and then we go on to talk about semantics.</p>
<p>PMR:Then we’ve got the day when we went through. An overview of what we had.</p>
<p>PMR:We had 2 large sessions of about an hour each. And they’re called part one and part 2.</p>
<p>PMR:And what they need is, documenting then we’ve got, a session here which talked about Ranganathan.</p>
<p>PMR:We’ve got one here which talks about. How we use GitHub, and how we create documents, particularly, from IPCC.</p>
<p>PMR:One here which, Concentrates on. Summarization. So I think that’s when, Harshall joined us.</p>
<p>PMR:And then, Yeah, we had a session on the overview of what we’re going to say for the top level narrative.</p>
<p>PMR:So does that make sense to people at the moment at the moment?</p>
<p>PMR:And what I’d like to do is to get a brief. Top level. Description of what’s in each of these.</p>
<p>PMR:I don’t know whether a summarizer can do it. I think, it’s probably a good idea.</p>
<p>PMR:That we go through, individually, market up and write, a paragraph, a list of what’s in it.</p>
<p>PMR:So that when we come back to it, we’re able to say, okay, this is the, minute at which we go into the video and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:Does that make sense to everybody?</p>
<p>[Parijat Bhadra] 09:29:30 Yes, it does.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-1">tasks</h2>
<p>PMR:Good. Okay. So, What I’m going to suggest is that we actually ask each person to take one of these.</p>
<p>PMR:We got 1, 2, we’re omitting, sorry, we’re meeting Renu.</p>
<p>PMR:So we got Savia, Richie, Animal, Niche. That’s 5.</p>
<p>PMR:Do you want to be? Involved in this or not. You probably got there’s probably more important things.</p>
<p>PMR:No more important is wrong. Hi, a level things to do.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:30:11 No, I think I can manage one of the recordings.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so, shall we, shall we ask people to volunteer here? So.</p>
<p>PMR:Who would, will miss summarization now? Cause that’s probably, harsh and we’ll miss, overview out.</p>
<p>PMR:So who would like to take climate?</p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</h3>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:30:40 Hey, could you or Dr. Dino could you quickly set up a spreadsheet for this so that we keep track of what these recordings are and who’s doing who’s taking the responsibility for it.</p>
<p>PMR:That’s a great idea. And all of these things like the spreadsheet, can be, and all of these things like the spreadsheet, can be, linked to from the final, from the final presentation so we will link to this management session what we’re doing here is management.</p>
<p>PMR:And so how we set up a spreadsheet would be really valuable.</p>
<p>PMR:This is quite a, this should be a fairly simple spreadsheet. It’s, you know, got 6 or 7, slots and a task for each person.</p>
<p>PMR:So, Renault, can you, do a simple spreadsheet?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:31:39 Yes, and I’m doing that I’m sharing well.</p>
<p>PMR:Good, okay. So, So let’s go through and. I think.</p>
<p>PMR:If I can point you at Ranganathan and that would probably be. You know a good thing to do because you probably got slightly and experience than other people of various things, right?</p>
<p>PMR:Does that make sense?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:32:12 Hmm, sure, I can give it a shot.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, okay. Who would like to do climate?</p>
<p>[smriti] 09:32:24 Okay, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>PMR:Well done. This is not very onerous, right? Who would like to talk about Open Notebook and Semantics.</p>
<p>[Parijat Bhadra] 09:32:36 I’ll do that.</p>
<p>PMR:Thank you. Who would like to talk about? Github.</p>
<p>PMR:Documentation.</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:32:49 Hi, I can take that.</p>
<p>PMR:Well, you’ve, you’ve taken one already. I think, and more, you haven’t said anything.</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 09:33:02 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Can you take that?</p>
<p>PMR:Right, okay. And we’ll come back to part one and part 2 in a minute.</p>
<p>PMR:So that’s That’s absolutely brilliant. Right. I think when they see people working together like this, they will be so impressed.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. Okay. We have.</p>
<p>PMR:A session on Pools, I’m not sure which one, I think the sooner that we can get top level,</p>
<p>PMR:Things for this, the better. Right.</p>
<p>[Sravya] 09:33:53 Hey, there is anything else that I can take?</p>
<p>PMR:I’m just thinking how this fits together. Well, why don’t you take part one and Nitica?</p>
<p>PMR:Volunteer take part 2, right? So this is a question of. Doing some very simple editing on the transcript and coming up with a summary.</p>
<p>PMR:The point about this is that this is a really, new and exciting way of doing things. Because It’s only just been possible since.</p>
<p>PMR:We had this, transcript from Zoom. I don’t know how long it’s been there but I would think a few months something like that and so this is a really What?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:34:49 Oh no, I’ve been using it for 3 years or something like that. Zoom has always had transcripts.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, okay, right. Well, even so, it still needs editing, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:35:05 Oh yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>PMR:Yeah, okay. What I found myself is that if I listen to this at doubles feed with the transcript in front of me, then, you know, I can.</p>
<p>PMR:Come come to the stage where I’ve got something that doesn’t make sense in the transcript.</p>
<p>PMR:And it can be briefly edited. By the way, we we’re not turning the transcript into, perfect, English.</p>
<p>PMR:What we’re doing is simply correcting, you know, mistakes like Reno and, You know, whatever names, the system gives you.</p>
<p>PMR:And also cutting out. The material, which is irrelevant, to the readers.</p>
<p>PMR:In other words, they don’t want to, What that they don’t want to see this?</p>
<p>PMR:What we want to do is to be able to convince people that this is a really good way of.</p>
<p>PMR:Of managing these team sessions. And that it’s relatively painless. Good. Okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:36:18 Can you also put out a deadline for this speaker?</p>
<p>PMR:And the deadline for this, I would say, we’re now Wednesday. Let’s say the deadline for tha Friday</p>
<p>PMR:I would say if we can have. So. Can we, I. Let’s find all the tasks and then prioritize them, okay?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:36:41 Yeah. I think it will be great if we can look at a spreadsheet right away. Dr.</p>
<p>PMR:Right.</p>
<h2 id="spreadsheet-1">spreadsheet</h2>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:36:48 Ranu, maybe if you have it, share it right away or I’ll set it up.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:36:52 Yeah, making it and I’ll share the link. I.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:36:54 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, so come back and when you’ve got it, will ask you to share the screen. So.</p>
<p>PMR:We have a session. On documents. Most of these things, now, so the top level headings I’ve got are roughly the following.</p>
<p>PMR:Why we’re doing this. What do documents we’re making semantic? communication tools that probably goes towards at the end we need, a considerable session on, our code, how it works and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:And then, we need</p>
<p>PMR:A discussion on how we manage these narratives. And then we need a separate.</p>
<h2 id="figures">figures</h2>
<p>Section on figures because I think we are going to have to make one or 2 figures, I’d like to make these figures where possible with, graph.</p>
<p>PMR:Because a lot of the ones that I’ve already from the past are in dotty.</p>
<p>PMR:We will have a session here on history, which I think is, I’m undoubtedly mine.</p>
<p>PMR:So that, Yes.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:38:40 To Peter this minute. Yeah, I’ll share the link in the chat. So I have to, name the people and then, write down the videos also or they will do it.</p>
<p>PMR:They will do it themselves. Yes.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:38:56 To assign which video. Yeah, they can do because it can be accessed by everyone. Hmm.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:38:59 I think we’ll do it right away because things slip. I can quickly screen share and, write it out if that helps.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:39:07 Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes, so I’m going to stop sharing.</p>
<h2 id="shweata-shows-spreadsheet">Shweata shows spreadsheet</h2>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:39:11 Okay. Yes, screen.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:39:18 Alright,</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:39:22 Hmm.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:39:26 Though we don’t need this.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:39:41 Okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:40:04 Okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:40:12 Okay. You have the name video and then</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:40:41 I’m Peter, can you repeat what you But the titles of each of the videos worth.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes, the titles at the moment, on</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:40:52 I could just perhaps.</p>
<p>PMR:And, I’ll give the date first.st There, they’re all, 2,000 and, 24 0 6 so on.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:40:58 Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, And o 5 Wait a minute. Yeah, sorry. On oh 5 10 o’clock by Mitch</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:41:22 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:O 5. Is 11 open note underscore semantic.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:41:30 Well, Sake.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:41:36 So this is open notebook plus.</p>
<p>PMR:So. That’s, when we come to look at the, summary of this then it may be that there are other things in it but this is i will label it in the system</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:41:51 Okay. Right.</p>
<p>PMR:The next one is 11. O 9. One</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:42:04 Oh wait, 11 0 9.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s, June 11, th 9 o’clock part one.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:42:11 Okay. Okay. What is it part one for?</p>
<p>PMR:It’s part one or an overview of the whole lot, right? So. I went through in a sort of.</p>
<p>PMR:I took to 1 h sessions and went through. Everything in this, everything that I wanted to say, but it probably wasn’t everything.</p>
<p>PMR:But it’s, it detailed much of what we wanted to do. So I saw these things called part one and part 2.</p>
<p>PMR:You know of the of the table of contents if you like, something like that.</p>
<p>PMR:And we have. The next one is 1110 part 2 which carries on from it</p>
<p>PMR:The next one is 13 0 9. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:43:20 Yep, I’m on it. So we have GitHub. Dot.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes. We have 1310 GitHub. Dot creation. And 0 6 i’m sorry.</p>
<p>PMR:14 0 9 summarization. And then yesterday we had one which we’ve called, 18 0 9 overview.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:43:39 Okay.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:43:52 So this is part 3 of you.</p>
<p>PMR:It probably, it’s actually over. Overview is probably not the best name.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s probably, if you like the,</p>
<p>PMR:It’s the abstract of the talk. If you see what I mean.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:44:14 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Well find out in more detail what it is and how much it overlaps with part one and part 2.</p>
<p>PMR:And, and this one, when I put it up, it’ll be called, at 19 0 9 management.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:44:22 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:This is a really important session. And I think that, I think that people who want to do this, if they can get a.</p>
<p>PMR:And. A clear idea of how we work. That could be extremely valuable. Hello, HARCHOT!</p>
<p>[Harshul Surana] 09:44:59 Peter, sorry for the dealer. I was I was outside and I took more time than I. And disability.</p>
<p>PMR:Oshaw, how are you?</p>
<p>PMR:Don’t worry. What we have done is we’ve asked. Everybody to take one of the sessions.</p>
<p>PMR:That we are that we’ve already recorded and to write a brief Call it one paragraph, summary of what’s in it.</p>
<h2 id="summarization">summarization</h2>
<p>PMR:And because we’re then going to reference it from our main. Narrative. So Did we do 14 0 9 summarization or did we leave that?</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:45:39 No, no, I’ve added it in here.</p>
<p>PMR:So, can Hartle do that?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:45:50 First, st Tell him what we are doing like summarization of the videos.</p>
<p>PMR:Well, it would be valuable to have summarization. We talked, it was a video talking about summarization, right?</p>
<p>PMR:But it will also be incredibly valuable. if actually, we’re able to do some video, summarization.</p>
<p>PMR:But we’ll come to that later. So, HAS, what we’re doing is we’re making all the videos available on Google Drive.</p>
<p>PMR:And each person has a video And with that from Zoom comes the transcript. And we’re turning the transcript.</p>
<p>PMR:And into marked down so people can read through it and come to the different sections there and we are changing we’re editing just Removing unnecessary things like people say, okay, you know, I have to go and I have to leave now or things like that.</p>
<p>PMR:And we are editing any of the names and other things that it got wrong. Does that make sense, Marshall?</p>
<p>[Harshul Surana] 09:47:19 Yes, Peter, like do we have to do it manually?</p>
<p>PMR:I think we’re going to have if you can, I think in the 1st instance, yes.</p>
<p>PMR:So, you know things like, Indian names are not consistently misspelled, right?</p>
<p>PMR:Renault gets spelled everything except RE NU, don’t you, Reno?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:47:46 Yes, we do.</p>
<p>PMR:You get run out of French car and, Reno, the American gambling place and, goodness knows what else.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:47:49 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:So, I think it’s it’s easier in the short term to go through this and, you know, and edit that.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:So, so, FREETER has a spreadsheet of, what people are going to do, this will be in the current management session.</p>
<p>PMR:There will be. You know, the, pointers to it from the top level, and that will be very exciting indeed.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay. So.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:48:43 But can you quickly? Jeremy. You are doing part one of part 2 or is it assigned to someone?</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, oh. Who? Who would like to take part 2? Part chose been marked.</p>
<p>[Nitika Baghel] 09:49:00 No, I think part one and 2 was assigned to</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, fine.</p>
<p>[Shweata Hegde] 09:49:07 Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Right, so this is really good. So, the There are so many things, in this, that will excite people.</p>
<p>PMR:So this is basically How to run a 21st century team. To create a semantic information products, right?</p>
<p>PMR:That’s what we’re doing, isn’t it, Reno?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:49:39 Yes, Peter, yeah.</p>
<p>PMR:And I think when they see this session here, I think it, at some stage we might ask everybody to, turn their videos on so that we can, so the world can see people.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:49:46 Hmm.</p>
<p>PMR:Why don’t we do that now?</p>
<p>PMR:I’m, we’ll do a few minutes with, the videos on so, so the world can see all of you.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:50:19 So who is doing the abstract?</p>
<p>PMR:And, and unless anybody is in bed or. Else wise.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:50:26 And Mole is in a call is, and M said he’s in a college.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, that’s fine.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:50:32 Yeah, maybe we’ll do some other time.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, it can be done some other time, but what we want is, at some stage to say this is how the team works and and that’s fine.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:50:40 Hmm.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, let’s continue then. So this is a very important, thing and this is management.</p>
<p>PMR:So.</p>
<p>PMR:We’ve actually got a session here. At the top level on management and then we go on to talk about Zoom slack and GitHub, lower down and, so forth.</p>
<p>PMR:What we would like from this is we’d like people to take screenshots of what some of these things look like.</p>
<p>PMR:So, a screenshot of what we can see at the moment, for example, I mean, it can be taken from the video.</p>
<p>PMR:So that’s. That’s no problem. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:So. Let me take a break, a breath and see. What the top level system now looks like.</p>
<p>PMR:What we’re going to, and we’ll try and get these into. Some sort of order</p>
<p>PMR:And it’s possible that we may need to clip. Some of the videos and some of the text to help.</p>
<p>PMR:Or it can be that we can point directly into. You know, some particular minute, label in either of these.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so</p>
<p>PMR:Just going to take a minute to compose myself. I will take the screen back. No, share screen.</p>
<p>PMR:And. Can you all see my screen?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:53:01 Yes.</p>
<p>PMR:Am I sharing my second screen and I was, can you see the director of, a list there?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:53:08 It’s the figure, no, we’re not seeing the, the figures, diagrams.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so, right at the top. The most important thing is what is the message we want to get across?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:53:31 Hmm.</p>
<h2 id="readership">readership</h2>
<p>PMR:To the readers of this. So. We don’t know who the readers are.</p>
<p>PMR:It will, I think, have quite a lot of. Increased. There’ll obviously be an interest in, libraries in India.</p>
<p>PMR:When we talk about libraries, when Ranganison, became librarian at the University of Mcgrass.</p>
<p>PMR:Exactly a hundred years ago. Then, the main thing that he would be doing dealing with is printed material.</p>
<p>PMR:And that would be books and Probably bound copies of, a scholarly publications, but, He had very wide-ranging interests.</p>
<p>PMR:And he will have been concerned and not just about academic libraries but also public libraries. And and so on i mean i’ve i would suggest everybody reads his biography it’s about 10 pages, but I think it, gives me a very good.</p>
<p>PMR:Impression on what he was like. And, if you can find time to read, more about, I think that would be very valuable.</p>
<p>PMR:Because what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to honor his vision. A hundred years later, and show the good things about the modern, information world.</p>
<p>PMR:So,</p>
<p>PMR:So we start off then with, our readership, which I suspect is going to be mainly.</p>
<p>PMR:Academic librarians by default. That’s my guess who would read, but we can ask and we’ll show for more details.</p>
<p>PMR:But Since it’s a library journal, it will get read elsewhere in the world and I can publicize this to the both to the Global North Library.</p>
<p>PMR:And, and also to the, Global South. Because I have enough contacts there.</p>
<p>PMR:So we will have a marketing campaign to get this, this article viewed by a lot of people now the special interest and issue will be important and will be saleable in that sense.</p>
<p>PMR:So we’ll try and get it out. As widely as possible. I’ve got a good Twitter following.</p>
<p>PMR:Particularly on, with libraries. So I would expect, it will get, you know, a considerable amount of Yeah.</p>
<p>PMR:So we’re appealing to. Academic library librarians across the world. Hopefully this will spread a bit to public librarians.</p>
<p>PMR:Hi, librarians across the world. And, it should also, speak to people who are interested in open and scientific publication and new ways of doing things.</p>
<p>PMR:Does that make sense at the moment?</p>
<h2 id="headline-story">headline story</h2>
<p>PMR:Okay, so. What we need is what is our headline story. A headline story is that in, and by the way, you can all contribute to this.</p>
<p>PMR:And the headline story is that, we are re-imagining, Bran Gannison’s vision a hundred years on, from his, appointment in Madras.</p>
<p>PMR:That in the 21st century. We are dealing with worldwide global. information.</p>
<p>PMR:We have to look at the that at the moment, It is not. Fully open.</p>
<p>PMR:In fact, it’s probably barely closed in many ways and what we are trying to do is liberate it.</p>
<p>PMR:So we’re liberating scholarly information in the 21st century. That’s the primary goal of this.</p>
<p>PMR:We’re doing it by, building a community which believes in this. And that community is building the tools.</p>
<p>PMR:To do it. And and producing examples of what the tools. Can, create.</p>
<p>PMR:So I think that’s, top level message. So Renew.</p>
<p>PMR:And others, does that make sense?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 09:59:05 Yes.</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 09:59:05 Yes.</p>
<p>PMR:Right. So then we come down to the next, more detailed thing is how are we doing it?</p>
<p>PMR:So. We start off with why we’re doing it. We need to show.</p>
<p>PMR:Brand GANS vision and then we also within that. Have the session on climate. Where we’re taking an important, critically important modern information area and using this new approach to make it more accessible to people.</p>
<p>PMR:We’re going to have to try and show how that is done. And also what the results are and why it is so so valuable.</p>
<h2 id="toplevel-mission">toplevel mission</h2>
<p>PMR:So always, in all the rest of this, we’re thinking about our top level mission, which is, the of You universal open semantic information and exemplified by climate information.</p>
<p>PMR:And and we are we are going to mention dynamic climate information with pi get paper stock analysis but here we’re going to concentrate on.</p>
<p>PMR:Static information from the IPCC. So we’re going to take this one example up to what we can do.</p>
<p>PMR:We can take these static PDF and Oh, when I said IPCC, I meant UN.</p>
<p>PMR:Static PDFs and legacy HTML and turn them into semantic HTML.</p>
<p>PMR:So. That’s our example. Then. Our tools and the 1st tool is management.</p>
<p>PMR:So we show how we work this. With our, regular sessions. Recording of everything in open notebook and, making it available to the world.</p>
<p>PMR:And also emphasizing that we’re having to build the tools for this. Because</p>
<p>PMR:They don’t currently exist. At the moment. We then, talk about how we develop our narratives.</p>
<p>PMR:And that we have 2 types of narratives. We have, the zoom narrative, which are, driven primarily by people, mainly myself, but people talking about particular sub kits which are of immediate relevance.</p>
<p>PMR:And that will talk about how we capture. The information from zoom and then we also mention our presentations, which are slides and videos, and I would say, that we need to do a,</p>
<p>PMR:A section on Reno’s, overview page of semantic climate. It doesn’t need to be large, but it needs to be a guide to.</p>
<p>PMR:Semantic climate. presentations and videos does that make sense for a</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:02:50 In this video I located.</p>
<p>PMR:So if you can since you created it. Are you, happy to do that?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:03:01 Yes. It’s about the present day and videos, all the resources.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s not huge.</p>
<p>PMR:Yes, exactly. The resources. So it’s a top level thing saying here are our resources, they grow, you know, regularly and, you know, here are the lectures here are the glossaries here are the semantic demonstrations and so on.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:03:10 Okay.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:03:30 Okay.</p>
<h2 id="future-editing">future editing</h2>
<p>PMR:Right, so that will be. Really valuable. Zen.</p>
<p>PMR:We need to talk about our repository structure. And I suspect that that’s probably got to be, me because it mainly on my system.</p>
<p>PMR:So I have to talk about documents. And, where the documents are kept.</p>
<p>PMR:And that’s going to be giving pointers to GitHub where we’ve got this semantic versions and and so on.</p>
<p>PMR:Which are at the moment in things like Amy, test tests, and so forth. And then we need to talk about code.</p>
<p>PMR:Oh, I want to talk about that. In the next interactive session. And I will be talking about Amy, Lib and Amy climate, because Pai get papers and dock analysis already have.</p>
<p>PMR:Publications with them we should mention them and have links to them and Perhaps. It should be possible to take and the top level documentation, and from both of those and summarize it, but we don’t have top level documentations.</p>
<p>PMR:For an enemy climate. And amy lib And then finally we have to think about figures.</p>
<p>PMR:Now I have been looking through my, historical figures. And I posted these into an A list, 2024, under figures.</p>
<p>PMR:And a lot of those are workflow diagrams of nearly 10 years ago</p>
<p>PMR:I haven’t put down in this which is history. Which has to be me. And this gives me the opportunity to include these historical diagrams.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:05:41 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:And people will say, Well, why? What does it look like now and and so forth?</p>
<p>PMR:And, but many of the diagrams are actually very relevant to today.</p>
<p>PMR:They haven’t changed in 10 years, which is a terrible. Commentary on semantic if you like it’s hardly changed in 10 years.</p>
<p>PMR:And then, but, so I will give the history. I will give those, telegrams the key ones there and then we probably need to make one or 2 more updated documents in graph is so it should be fairly straightforward to do graph is stop documents but what we’ve got at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="graphviz">graphviz</h2>
<p>PMR:As anyone here use graph is dotty.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:06:59 No.</p>
<p>PMR:Alright, so I’m looking for volunteer, somebody who, likes a bit of coding.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s very straightforward, to do, and I will, I will get people started on that.</p>
<p>PMR:So I need a volunteer to do dotty diagrams.</p>
<p>PMR:Let me show you a dotty diagram.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:07:29 One question. What should be the format in which the summary should be there for the spreadsheet, the videos.</p>
<p>PMR:We’re doing, we’re doing everything in marked down at the moment. But for the final, document, we will turn it into, Google Doc, which can be a printed out of words.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:07:41 Okay.</p>
<p>PMR:Does that make sense?</p>
<h2 id="communal-googledoc">communal Googledoc</h2>
<p>PMR:So we can all contribute. To this Google Doc. I think we will grow a large Google Doc and then we will probably go through.</p>
<p>PMR:Just, you know, a day before the deadline. The worst, sorry.</p>
<p>PMR:Cut out. Anything that isn’t really a summary. Does that all make sense?</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:08:28 Hmm.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so, this is going to be world beating I can promise you. But, We’ve had our hour.</p>
<p>PMR:Amy is getting restless. She hasn’t had any T. And. So before we close this down.</p>
<p>PMR:Any comments? Things at the moment.</p>
<p>PMR:Okay, so everybody’s up to speed with the, general technology. Is that right?</p>
<p>PMR:Everybody come run Python papers, dock analysis.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:09:18 We can, everybody can ask the questions if it’s required because if you don’t understand anything, then just ask all the things.</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 10:09:20 Yes.</p>
<p>PMR:Absolutely.</p>
<p>[Anmol Negi] 10:09:29 I just didn’t heard when is the deadline for this.</p>
<p>PMR:So the 1st task that we’ve got is annotating the particular sessions that we’ve mentioned and I would like to visit this on Friday on the Friday session.</p>
<p>PMR:Can you have that adaptation done? By Friday, I would guess that for one of these sessions it will take about an hour.</p>
<p>[Renu Kumari] 10:10:05 Hmm.</p>
<p>PMR:It’s mainly a question of going through spotting any obvious typos. Don’t worry about the ums and does and things of that sort.</p>
<p>PMR:And we’ll actually have a look at what we’ve created here and we’ll go through this one and mark it up so you’ll get an idea of how to mark it up.</p>
<p>PMR:And that’s will give you an idea of. The time it will take.</p>
