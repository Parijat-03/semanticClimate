Companies with SBTs span a diverse range of industries and are frequently found within services, consumer goods, and equipment and components (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The low number of companies in the raw materials industry reflects the current lack of guidance for the oil and gas sector and the forest, land, and agriculture sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Geographical distribution of 1039 companies with approved SBTs through November 2021.
