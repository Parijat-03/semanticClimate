Another possibility is to investigate technical measures such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or direct air capture technologies (Preston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). However, while there are no shortages of CCS being included in plans, if all the CCS projects that were planned for 2015 had been built, it would have sequestered approximately 0.2 per cent of the total emissions in 2015 (Smil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>: 184). Moreover, such novel technologies are untested on the required scale, and negative environmental effects are possible.</p>
