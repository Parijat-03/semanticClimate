<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Two Sustainable Development Goals that sport can strive to meet include, SDG 11&#8212;make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, and SDG 12&#8212;sustainable consumption and production (Schr&#246;der et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). There are many ways the sport industry can meet the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and these two SDGs. One innovative approach is moving toward emerging circular sustainability and construction methods. Wergeland and Hognestad (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) recently emphasized green strategies and perspectives such as the circular economy that could extend the lifecycle of existing football stadia. Bengtsson et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) argued that the circular economy, defined through specific actions and practices such as eco-design, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing (Nasr and Thurston, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), repair and product sharing (Chertow and Ehrenfeld, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), can contribute to reaching the social, economic, and environmental targets set forth by the 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
