Adaptation responses within irrigation systems include the adoption of new irrigation technologies or upgrading existing technologies, adopting water conservation measures, water rationing, constructing water storage infrastructure, and change in cropping patterns (Rasul et al., 2019; Figure&#160;2.9). Water delivery technologies which reduce loss are adopted in Chile (Young et al., 2010) and Peru (Orlove et al., 2019). Similarly, greenhouses have been adopted in Nepal (Konchar et al., 2015) to reduce evapotranspiration and frost damage, though limited access to &#64257;nance is a barrier to these activities. Box&#160;2.3 describes innovative irrigation practices in India. Local pastoral communities have responded to these challenges with techniques broadly similar to those in agricultural settings by expanding irrigation facilities, for example, in Switzerland (Fuhrer et al., 2014). In addition to adopting new technologies, some water users make investments to tap more distant sources of irrigation water. Cross-Chapter Box&#160;3 in Chapter&#160;1 discusses such efforts in Northern Pakistan, where landslides, associated with cryosphere change, have also damaged irrigation systems.  </span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.93" top="447.56"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 447.56; y1: 457.06; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="447.56" x1="312.93">The adoption of new crops and varieties is an adaptation response found in several regions. Farmers in northwest India have increased production of lentils and vegetables, which provide important nutrients to the local diet, with support from government watershed improvement programs which help address decreased availability of irrigation water, though stringent requirements for participation in the programs have limited access by poor households to this assistance (Dame and N&#252;sser, 2011). Farmers who rely on irrigation in the Naryn River basin in Kyrgyzstan have shifted from the water intensive fruits and vegetables to fodder crops such as barley and alfalfa, which are more pro&#64257;table. Upstream communities, with greater access to water and more active local institutions, are more willing to experiment with new crops than those further downstream (Hill et al., 2017). In other areas, crop choices also re&#64258;ect responses to rising temperatures along with new market opportunities such as the demand for fresh vegetables by tourists in Nepal (Konchar et al., 2015; Dangi et al., 2018) and the demand for roses in urban areas in Peru (SENASA, 2017). Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;4 in Chapter&#160;1), access to local and regional seed supply networks, proximity to agricultural extension and support services also facilitate the adoption of new crops (Skarb&#248; and VanderMolen, 2014).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.44" top="735.59"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.3; y0: 735.59; y1: 745.09; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.59" x1="571.44">Local institutions and embedded social relations play a vital role in enabling mountain communities to respond to the impacts of climate driven cryosphere change. Indigenous pastoral communities who have tapped into new water sources to irrigate new areas have also strengthened the control of access to existing irrigated pastures in Peru (Postigo, 2014) and Bolivia (Yager, 2015). In an example of indigenous populations in the USA, two tribes who share a large reservation in the Northern Rockies rely on rivers which receive glacier melt water to irrigate pasture, and maintain &#64257;sheries, domestic water supplies, and traditional ceremonial practices. Tribal water managers have sought to install infrastructure to promote more ef&#64257;cient water use and protect &#64257;sheries, but these efforts have been impeded by land and water governance institutions in the region and by a history of social marginalisation (McNeeley, 2017). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.51" top="555.61"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 328.89; y0: 555.61; y1: 565.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="555.61" x1="571.51">High mountain communities have sought new &#64257;nancial resources from wage labour (Section&#160;2.3.7), tourism (Mukherji et al., 2019) and government sources to support adaptation activities. Local water user associations in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have adopted less water intensive crops and reorganised the use and maintenance of irrigation systems, investing government relief payments after &#64258;oods (Stucker et al., 2012). Similar measures are reported from India and Pakistan (Dame and Mankelow, 2010; Clouse, 2016; N&#252;sser and Schmidt, 2017), Nepal (McDowell et al., 2013) and Peru (Postigo, 2014). In contrast, fewer adaptation measures have been adopted in Uzbekistan, due to low levels of capital availability and to agricultural policies, including centralised water management, crop production quotas and weak agricultural extension, which limit the response capacity of farmers (Aleksandrova et al., 2014). </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.48" top="375.63"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.3; y0: 375.63; y1: 385.13; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="375.63" x1="571.48">Lowland agricultural areas which receive irrigation water from rivers fed by glacier melt and snowmelt are projected to face negative impacts in some regions (</span><span style="x0: 425.73; x1: 427.84; y0: 351.63; y1: 361.13; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="425.73" y0="351.63" x1="552.86">limited evidence, high agreement</span><span style="x0: 552.86; x1: 555.5; y0: 351.63; y1: 361.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="552.86" y0="351.63" x1="571.45">). In the Rhone basin in Switzerland, many irrigated pasture areas are projected to face water de&#64257;cits by 2050, under the A1B scenario (Fuhrer et al., 2014; Cross Chapter Box&#160;1 in Chapter&#160;1). For California and the southwestern USA, a shift to peak snowmelt earlier in the year would create more frequent &#64258;oods, and a reduced ability of existing reservoirs to store water by 2050 under RCP8.5 (Pag&#225;n et al.,  2016) and by 2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Pathak  et al., 2018). The economic values of these losses have been estimated at 10.8&#8211;48.6&#160;billion USD by around 2050 (Sturm et al., 2017).  A similar transition to runoff peaks earlier in the year by 2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, creating challenges for management of irrigation water, has been reported for the countries in central Asia which are dependent on snow cover and glaciers of the Tien Shan (Xenarios et al., 2018). In India and Pakistan, where over 100&#160;million farmers receive irrigation from the Indus and Ganges Rivers, which also have signi&#64257;cant inputs from glaciers and snowmelt, also face risks of decreasing water supplies from cryosphere change by 2100 (Biemans et al., 2019; Rasul and Molden, 2019).</span></div></body></html>
