To date, more than 1000 companies have set SBTs, which are widely associated with serious intentions on climate action. For example, the UK government conflated SBTs with &#8220;strong climate credentials&#8221; in their call for corporate sponsors for the COP26 event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the Hague District Court referenced the SBT concept in their ruling ordering Shell to set more ambitious climate targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the SBT concept inspired the European Commission&#8217;s climate benchmarks for Paris-aligned investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the Biden administration suggested that large federal suppliers be required to set SBTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
