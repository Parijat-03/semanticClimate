<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By a happy coincidence, <italic>ACS Omega</italic> publishes its 200th
issue a week before this year&#8217;s
International Open Access Week (October 24&#8211;30, 2022, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.openaccessweek.org/">https://www.openaccessweek.org/</uri>). This dual celebration gives us an opportunity to reflect on how
far we have come as a journal as well as on the many other opportunities
in Open Science that have become available to authors and researchers
at ACS Publications since the journal published its first issue.</p>
