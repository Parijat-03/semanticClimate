<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par37">We summarize our results using the following three schemas. Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the most important norms in the multi-level perspective. In addition, we index the norms according to the texts they occur in. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the distribution of the two normative categories in the different texts, i.e., ethical and techno-scientific norms. The figure highlights that there is considerable overlap in the normative orientation of the three texts on the macro-level (see also &#8220;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">The macro-level</xref>&#8221; section). It also shows that the two UN documents have a rather similar normative approach to meso-level issues, i.e., especially their focus on national sovereignty. Finally, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that both SDGs and Encyclical have a much stronger and more balanced normative orientation than the PA on the micro-level. In fact, the SDGs emphasize the importance of &#8220;empowerment&#8221; and the Encyclical has the topic of &#8220;responsibility&#8221; as a central one, whereas the Paris Agreement leaves more personal dimensions of change untouched. Therefore, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> reveals some normative symmetry between the SDGs and the Encyclical on the micro-level. However, the normative polarization between the Encyclical and the UN documents observed in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> dominates the comparison.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#160;2</label><caption><p>Systematic index of the most significant norms found in the three documents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Ethical norms</th><th align="left">Techno-scientific norms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Macro-level</td><td align="left">&#8220;Universal&#8221;/&#8221;global solidarity&#8221; (Enz/SDGs)<break/>&#8220;Climate justice&#8221; (PA)<break/>&#8220;Human rights&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Human dignity&#8221; (Enz/SDGs)</td><td align="left">Global &#8220;indicators&#8221; (SDGs)/&#8220;stocktake&#8221; (PA)<break/>&#8220;Transparent information&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Global average temperature&#8221; (SDGs/PA/Enz)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Meso-level</td><td align="left">&#8220;Social cohesion&#8221; (Enz)<break/>&#8220;Social and moral progress&#8221; (Enz)<break/>&#8220;Mutual trust&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Common but differentiated responsibilities&#8221; (SDGs/PA)</td><td align="left">&#8220;Accountability&#8221; (SDGs)<break/>&#8220;Capacity-building&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Inform the global stocktake&#8221; (PA)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Micro-level</td><td align="left">&#8220;Responsibility&#8221; (Enz)<break/>&#8220;Empowerment&#8221; (SDGs)<break/>&#8220;Desire to change&#8221; (Enz)<break/>&#8220;Contribution&#8221; to change (SDGs)</td><td align="left">&#8220;Traditional knowledge&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Knowledge of indigenous peoples&#8221; (SDGs/PA)<break/>&#8220;Local knowledge systems&#8221; (PA)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The parentheses show the relevant documents</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
