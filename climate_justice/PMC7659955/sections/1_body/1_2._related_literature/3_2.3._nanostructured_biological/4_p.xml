<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In another nano structured bio-sensor study, Shi et al. [<xref rid="B26-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] observed the presence of soil acetamiprid using SELEX; a new 20 mer bio-sensing unit that is able to bind acetamiprid, using aptamer made of nanoparticles of gold. The unit works to detect the pesticide optically at values ranging from 75 nM to 7.5 &#181;M. It bears the combined characteristics of a nanomaterial, and those of artificial molecules. Tested soils were collected around Tongji University, China, with initial air-drying carried out before the sample was grinded, to allow 1.0 mm sieving. A second drying was also done using an oven at 35 &#176;C for 2 days, prior to acetone mixing and shaking at 25 &#176;C for 60 min. Dichloromethane was subsequently added to the mixture, and then removed ultrasonically before the sample was filtered. </p>
