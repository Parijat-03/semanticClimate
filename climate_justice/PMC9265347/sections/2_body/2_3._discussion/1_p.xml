<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The proposed study will add to the scarce literature investigating school-based programmes to promote climate awareness and action among adolescents. Given that almost all adolescents aged under 16 years and approximately 87% of adolescents aged 16 to 19 attend schools on a regular basis in Germany [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], the PCS has the potential to reach a substantial share of adolescents. By involving broad groups of adolescents in the PCS, we anticipate that the school-based programme will contribute to extending proactive participation in climate change efforts beyond adolescents from higher socioeconomic backgrounds reported to be traditionally involved in climate action to a larger extent [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijerph-19-08039" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The PCS thus has the potential to contribute meaningfully to national climate mitigation and adaptation efforts if proven effective and rolled out more broadly.</p>
