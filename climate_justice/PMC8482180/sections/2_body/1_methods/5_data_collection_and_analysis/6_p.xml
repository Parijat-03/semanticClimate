Each short- and long-term objective will be assessed beginning with descriptive analyses to generate accurate population or subpopulation profiles. This will enable all further regression analyses to consider the intersection of multiple identities and sex and gender variations. Profiles that reflect the behavior or outcomes of subpopulations will be constructed. For example, sex and gender differences in the perception of app features and usefulness in association with age and digital literacy status (urban, rural, and remote) will be delineated to enable refinement of the platform. Missing data will be rigorously explored and addressed appropriately to ensure maximum use of objective and subjective data. Missing patterns will be explored before applying imputation or deletion strategies for different mechanisms: ignorable missing (random missing) and nonignorable missing [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Comprehensive exploration will also be conducted to identify potential ignorable missing (random) or nonignorable missing data across the intersection of sex and gender spectra. As variation in app use is expected among citizens, understanding and addressing missing data through imputation or deletion strategies will be critical to address the project objectives [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
