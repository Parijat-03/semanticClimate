Although there has been no empirical evidence to suggest that COVID-19 spread is influenced by climate change, the underlying conditions that contribute to climate change have some impacts on disease spread. For instance, deforestation affects animal emigration which can lead to cross-contact of pathogens when animals are driven together, for animal species that would never have met but for actions, like deforestation and loss of habitat.</p>
