<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0145">The use of content analysis does not exclude the adoption of other methods &#8211; both in backup or corroborating techniques. Alternative methods to define and explain complex phenomena connected to sustainable development include bibliometrics and composite indicators (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Drago and Gatto, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gatto et&#160;al., 2022</xref>). As for these alternative methods, content analysis is able to approach topics of ample magnitude, but it has the property to convey a clear message to vast segments of science and society. That is why this methodology has been preferred for this study. In addition, the mentioned methods can only be used to quantify phenomena, whereas content analysis is a good fit for qualitative topics and purposes.</p>
