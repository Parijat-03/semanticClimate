<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To evaluate the magnitude of effects, we calculate the incidence rate ratios for a standard deviation change in each continuous variable and a change from 0 to 1 for each dichotomous variable. <xref rid="pone.0261752.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows these ratios. The numbers should be interpreted carefully. Tribal leaders have often described, and scholars have already documented, the severe barriers economic development on tribal lands. Therefore, it should be no surprise that tribes find wind power development nearly impossible if they lack any particular advantages&#8212;no participation in CERT, no fossil fuel economy, no federal grants for wind power development, and typical values for continuous variables. Put simply, the typical tribe is locked out of wind power development, and the predicted number of turbines is .000007. Yet as advantages accrue, tribes have prospects of threading the needle. For a tribe with a casino one standard deviation above the mean size, that participated in CERT, and that has a fossil fuel economy, we predict 4.9 wind turbines. By far, the most significant contributor to that increase is the size of casinos.</p>
