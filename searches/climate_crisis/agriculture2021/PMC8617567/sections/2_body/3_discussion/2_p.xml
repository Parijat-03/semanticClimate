<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The pandemic has imposed constraints on people's social behavior, mobility, and daily activities globally (Nouvellet et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Van Bavel et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Parks and natural open spaces are receiving more attention than the previous years from the public because of their irreplaceable functions for benefiting people's physical and mental health (Geng et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Parks provide critical services during the pandemic to support outdoor recreations without violating social distancing restrictions and mitigate the stress associated with COVID&#8208;19 (Geng et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Xie et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Accompanied with the pandemic, massive wildfires in 2020 in the western and central US also affect people's mobility patterns to parks and natural open spaces given the public health concern and the loss of recreation in those places. In this study, we explored three metrics that describe human mobility to parks, including the number of visits per capita, the median of minimum dwell time at parks, and the travel distance to park. Additionally, we examined the effects of different factors, such as the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, wildfires, and drought, on those metrics.</p>
