Stern concluded that &#8220;the claim &#8216;we cannot afford it&#8217; is not very different from &#8216;we are not sufficiently bothered to deal seriously with climate change&#8217; &#8230; [and] that is simply reckless&#8221; (Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2009</xref>: 179). So, interest from security establishments in climate risks and in analyzing policy options are rising globally (World Economic Forum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2019</xref>). Actually, the main solution lies in ensuring adaptation-focused human security in situ from increasing vulnerabilities.</p>
