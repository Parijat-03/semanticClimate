<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The multi-dimensional influences of extreme events produce compounded impacts on dwellers&#8217; physical health, mental health, and well-being. These complex health and well-being issues need to be addressed by integrated and interdisciplinary knowledge and strategies [<xref rid="B28-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which are aligned with the interdisciplinary nature of the social work profession, especially in the health and social care sectors and community settings [<xref rid="B29-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, according to Maramaldi and colleagues [<xref rid="B31-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], social workers in the healthcare sector indicate that interdisciplinary training could swiftly place them within a multidisciplinary healthcare team and enhance the healthcare quality that these social workers could offer their clients. This could be accomplished by exploring various patient-specific factors (e.g., home environment, beliefs, and culture). Through a social-work-engineering collaborative course in global community development, students from both disciplines could extend beyond disciplinary boundaries to engage different knowledge, skills, and culture-sensitive approaches to jointly solve real-world problems [<xref rid="B32-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The upward number of global extreme events and their complexity of influences urgently require an interdisciplinary approach. However, the interdisciplinary component has been slowly developing in the GSW education and professional training. </p>
