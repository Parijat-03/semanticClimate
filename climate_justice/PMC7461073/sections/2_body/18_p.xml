<bold>Tessa:</bold> The Black Lives Matter movement has helped to force a long overdue reckoning on race and racial justice within the climate movement in the Global North. In addition to coming to terms with the overall whiteness of the movement, it's forcing a lot of groups that work on climate change to ask hard questions about whether or not their demands are actually ambitious enough to deliver climate justice. Are the kinds of changes they're asking for, like net zero emissions for rich countries in 30&#8201;years, really enough to protect black lives and white lives equally? Or does it involve sacrificing black and brown communities in the Global South who have done almost nothing to contribute to the climate crisis?</p>
