Downhill skiing, the most popular form of snow recreation, occurs in 67 countries (Vanat, 2018). The Alps in Europe support the largest ski industry (Vanat, 2018). In Europe, the growth of alpine skiing and winter tourism after 1930 brought major economic growth to alpine regions and transformed winter sports into a multi-billion USD industry (Denning, 2014). Sixteen percent of skier visits occur in the USA, where expenditures from all recreational snow sports generated more than 695,000 jobs and 72.7&#160;billion USD in trip-related spending in 2016 (Outdoor Industry Association, 2017). While the number of ski resorts in the USA has been decreasing since the 1980s, China added 57 new ski resorts in 2017 (Vanat, 2018). Although the bulk of economic activity is held within mountain communities, supply chains for production of ski equipment and apparel span the globe. Steiger et al. (2017) point out that Asia, Africa and South America are underrepresented in the ski tourism literature, and Africa and the Middle East are not signi&#64257;cant markets from a ski tourism perspective.</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.95" top="519.55"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.13; y0: 519.55; y1: 529.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="519.55" x1="312.95">Skiing&#8217;s reliance on favourable atmospheric and snow conditions make it particularly vulnerable to climate change (Arent et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Snow reliability, although not universally de&#64257;ned, quanti&#64257;es whether the snow cover is suf&#64257;cient for ski resorts operations. Depending on the context, it focuses on speci&#64257;c periods of the winter season, and may account for interannual variability and/or for snow management (Steiger et al., 2017). The effects of less snow, due to strong correlation between snow cover and skier visits, cost the USA economy 1&#160;billion USD and 17,400 jobs per year between 2001&#8211;2016 in years of less seasonal snow (Hagenstad et al., 2018). Efforts to reduce climate change impacts and risks to economic losses focus on increased snowmaking, such as arti&#64257;cial production of snow (Steiger et al., 2017), summertime slope preparation (Pintaldi et al., 2017), grooming (Steiger et al., 2017), and snow farming, that is, storage of snow (Gr&#252;newald et al., 2018). The effectiveness of snow management methods as adaptation to long-term climate change depends on suf&#64257;ciently low air temperature conditions needed for snowmaking, water and energy availability, compliance with environmental regulations (de Jong, 2015), and ability to pay for investment and operating costs. When these requirements are met, evidence over the past decades shows that snow management methods have generally proven ef&#64257;cient in reducing the impact of reduced natural snow cover duration for many resorts (Dawson and Scott, 2013; Hopkins and Maclean, 2014; Steiger et al., 2017; Spandre et al., 2019a). The number of skier visits was found to be 39% less sensitive to natural snow variations in Swiss ski resorts with 30% areal snowmaking coverage (representing the national average), compared to resorts without snowmaking (Gonseth, 2013). In some regions, many resorts (mostly smaller, low-elevation resorts) have closed due to unfavourable snow conditions brought on by climate change and/or the associated need for large capital investments for snowmaking capacities (e.g.,&#160;in northeast USA; Beaudin and Huang, 2014). To offset loss in ski tourism revenue, a key adaptation strategy is diversi&#64257;cation, offering other non-snow recreation options such as mountain biking, mountain coasters and alpine slides, indoor climbing walls and water parks, festivals and other special events (Figure&#160;2.9; Hagenstad et al., 2018; Da Silva et al., 2019).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.97" top="63.61"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 67.21; y0: 63.61; y1: 73.11; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="64.91" y0="63.61" x1="312.97">In the near term (2031&#8211;2050) and regardless of the greenhouse gas </span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.45" top="735.61"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.65; y0: 735.61; y1: 745.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="735.61" x1="571.45">especially at lower elevation, although snow reliability is projected to be maintained at many resorts in North America (Wobus et al., 2017) and in the European Alps, Pyrenees and  Scandinavia (Marke et al., 2015; Steiger et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2019; Spandre et al., 2019a; Spandre et al., 2019b). At the end of the century (2081&#8211;2100), under RCP8.5, snow reliability is projected to be unviable for most ski resorts under current operating practices in North America, the European Alps and Pyrenees, Scandinavia and Japan, with some exceptions at high elevation or high-latitudes (Steiger et al., 2017; Wobus et al., 2017; Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2019; Spandre et al., 2019a; Spandre et al., 2019b). Only few studies have used RCP2.6 in the context of ski tourism, and results indicate that the risks at the end of the century (2081&#8211;2100) are expected to be similar to the near term impacts (2031&#8211;2050) for RCP8.5 (Scott et al., 2019; Spandre et al., 2019a).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.45" top="543.63"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 327.65; y0: 543.63; y1: 553.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="543.63" x1="571.45">The projected economic losses reported in the literature include an annual loss in hotel revenues of EUR 560&#160;million  (2012 value) in Europe, compared to the period 1971&#8211;2000 under a 2&#186;C global warming scenario (Damm et al., 2017). This estimate includes population projections but does not account for snow management. In the USA, Wobus et al. (2017) estimate annual revenue losses from tickets (skiing) and day fees (cross country skiing and snowmobiling) due to reduced snow season length, will range from 340&#8211;780&#160;million USD in 2050 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, and from 130&#160;million to 2&#160;billion USD in 2090 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively, taking into account snow management and population projections. Total economic losses from these studies would be much higher if all costs were included (costs for tickets, transport, lodging, food and equipment). Regardless of the climate scenario, as risk of &#64257;nancial unviability increases, there are reported expectations that companies would need to forecast when their assets may become stranded assets and require devaluation or conversion to liabilities, and report this on their balance sheets (Caldecott et al., 2016). Economic impacts are projected to occur in other snow-based winter activities including events (e.g.,&#160;ski races) and other recreation activities such as cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, backcountry skiing, ice climbing, sledding, snowmobiling and snow tubing. By 2050, 13 (out of 21) prior Olympic Winter Games locations are projected to exhibit adequate snow reliability under RCP2.6, and 10 under RCP8.5. By 2080, the number decreases to 12 and 8, respectively (Scott et al., 2018). Even for cities remaining cold enough to host ski competitions, costs are projected to rise for making and stockpiling snow, as was the case in Sochi, Russia in 2014 and Vancouver, Canada in 2010 (Scott et al., 2018), and preserving race courses through salting (Hagenstad et al., 2018).</span></div><div left="323.44" right="571.49" top="171.67"><span style="x0: 323.44; x1: 325.74; y0: 171.67; y1: 181.17; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.44" y0="171.67" x1="571.49">In summer, cryosphere changes are impacting glacier-related activities (hiking, sightseeing, skiing, climbing and mountaineering) (Figure&#160;2.8). In recent years, several ski resorts operating on glaciers have ceased summer operations due to unfavourable snow conditions and excessive operating costs (e.g.,&#160;Falk, 2016). Snow management and snowmaking are increasingly used on glaciers (Fischer et al., 2016). Glacier retreat has led to increased moraine instability which can compromise hiker and climber safety along established trails and common access routes, for example, in Iceland (Welling et al., 2019), though it has made some areas in the Peruvian Andes more accessible </span></div></body></html>
