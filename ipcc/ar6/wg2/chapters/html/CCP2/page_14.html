As an enabler, trust in early warnings can mitigate flood risk by incentivising evacuation (Binh et&#160;al., 2020) and high trust can help overcome uncertainty attached to projected climate impacts and/or adaptation decisions (Frederiksen, 2014). As a barrier, low trust can disincentivise adaptation, for example willingness to pay for flood insurance (Roder et&#160;al., 2019) or public support for managed retreat (Hanna et&#160;al., 2020). Paradoxically, high trust in existing adaptation measures can reduce people&#8217;s perceived need for ongoing adaptation (e.g., levees potentially reducing individual flood-proofing actions). Adaptation decisions also manifest &#8216;single-action bias&#8217;, with modest cost-adaptation actions in the present disincentivising further adaptation (Buchanan et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.25" top="186.67"><span x0="42.52" y0="186.67" x1="296.25" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 46.74; y0: 186.67; y1: 196.17; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Several tools to incentivise adaptation behaviour are being tested around the world.

In Catalonia, while public funds are currently used to finance beach nourishment, these costs will increase with SLR and it is unclear whether public finance will remain a feasible source (Hinkel et&#160;al., 2018). Even in relatively richer municipalities, financing adaptation is constrained by other urban priorities (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018). In Europe, shifting responsibilities from national governments to transnational and local actors has resulted in reduced national budgets for coastal adaptation investment and increased pressure on local authorities to raise public funds for adaptation without alienating electoral bases (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018).</span></div><div left="306.71" right="560.39" top="342.64"><span x0="306.71" y0="342.64" x1="560.39" style="x0: 306.71; x1: 310.58; y0: 342.64; y1: 352.14; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Locations in the Global South have limited public budgets allocated to coastal adaptation and may rely on international donor aid (Donner et&#160;al., 2016; Araos et&#160;al., 2017). Such aid is often inconsistent and short term, which limits long-term maintenance of the knowledge, equipment and infrastructure needed to sustain adaptation measures beyond initial funding periods (Weiler et&#160;al., 2018; Thomas et&#160;al., 2020), with resultant negative consequences in places as different as Kiribati (Donner and Webber, 2014) and Bangladesh (Hinkel et&#160;al., 2018). Donor-funded adaptation programs aimed at promoting behavioural change, for example through coastal planning or new decision-making systems, require enduring training and institutional capacity, which is difficult to upkeep after aid is depleted. Donor funding is often project based and there are few avenues available to fund the additional permanent and long-term staff needed to bolster climate change institutions. Without funding to support additional staff, existing institutions often lack the human capacity and resources needed for coastal adaptation (Ziervogel and Parnell, 2014).</span></div><div left="306.71" right="560.39" top="126.66"><span x0="306.71" y0="126.66" x1="560.39" style="x0: 306.71; x1: 311.81; y0: 126.66; y1: 136.16; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: MWVGBK+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">C&amp;S in the Global South also face financial challenges in addressing loss and damage due to climate-induced slow-onset and extreme events.
