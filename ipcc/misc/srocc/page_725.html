ARC payouts have been used to assist over&#160;2.1&#160;million food insecure people and provide more than 900,000 cattle with subsidised feed in the affected countries (Iyahen and Syroka 2018). ARC has also developed the Extreme Climate Facility, which is designed to complement existing bilateral, multilateral and private sources of &#64257;nance to enable proactive adaptation (Vincent et al. 2018). It provides bene&#64257;ciaries the opportunity to increase their bene&#64257;t by reducing exposure to risk through adaptation and risk reduction measures, thus side-stepping &#8216;moral hazard&#8217; problems sometimes associated with traditional&#160;insurance.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="267.58"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.01; y0: 267.58; y1: 277.08; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="267.58" x1="313.26">Governments pay coupon interest when purchasing catastrophe (CAT) bonds from private or corporate investors. In the case of the prede&#64257;ned catastrophe, the requirement to pay the coupon interest or repay the principal may be deferred or forgiven (Nguyen and Lindenmeier 2014). CAT bonds are typically short-term instruments (three to &#64257;ve years) and the payout is triggered once a&#160;particular threshold of disaster/damage is passed (H&#228;rdle and Cabrera 2010; Campillo et al. 2017; Estrin and Tan 2016; Hermann et al. 2016; Michel-Kerjan 2011; Roberts 2017). The primary advantage of CAT bonds is their ability to quickly disburse money in the event of a&#160;catastrophe (Estrin and Tan 2016). Green bonds, social impact bonds, and resilience bonds are other instruments that can be used to fund land-based interventions. However, there are signi&#64257;cant barriers for developing country governments to enter into the bond market: lack of familiarity with the instruments; lack of capacity and resources to deal with complex legal arrangements; limited or non-existent data and modelling of disaster exposure; and other political disincentives linked to insurance.

More recently there have been developments in more innovative mechanisms, including crowdfunding (Lam and Law 2016), often supported by national governments (in the UK through regulatory and tax support) (Owen et al. 2018). Crowdfunding has no &#64257;nancial intermediaries and thus low transaction costs, and the projects have a&#160;greater degree of independence than bank or institution funding (Miller et al. 2018). Other examples of innovative mechanisms are community shares for local projects, such as renewable energy (Holstenkamp and Kahla 2016), or Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) used by companies such as Google and Apple to purchase renewable energy directly or virtually from developers (Miller et al. 2018). Investing companies bene&#64257;t from avoiding unpredictable price &#64258;uctuations as well as increasing their environmental credentials. A second example is auctioned price &#64258;oors, or subsidies that offer a&#160;guaranteed price for future emission reductions, currently being trialled in developing countries, by the World Bank Group, known as the Pilot Auction Facility for Methane and Climate Change Mitigation (PAF) (Bodnar et al. 2018). Price &#64258;oors can maximise the climate impact per public dollar while incentivising private investment in low-carbon technologies, and ideally would be implemented in conjunction with complementary policies such as carbon pricing.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.74" top="363.55"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 363.55; y1: 373.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="323.72" y0="363.55" x1="571.74">In order for climate &#64257;nance to be as effective and ef&#64257;cient as possible, cooperation between private, public and third sectors (e.g., non-governmental organisations (NGOs), cooperatives, and community groups) is more likely to create an enabling environment for innovation (Owen et al. 2018).
