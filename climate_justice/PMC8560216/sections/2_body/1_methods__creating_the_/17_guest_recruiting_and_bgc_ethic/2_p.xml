Guests who are invited and agree to be on the BGC podcast are provided with detailed information on the pre- and post-production process. The interview questions are shared with guests prior to the recording session in order to allow them to prepare and feel comfortable with the process. An unrecorded pre-interview is also conducted where the host and guest get to know each other and establish rapport to the extent possible. The purpose of this step is also to build trust between each other and to identify specific aspects of their work that directly relates to the goals of the podcast.</p>
