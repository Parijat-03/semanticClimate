We see rising interest in movements for racial and environmental justice, gender equality, food sovereignty, immigrant and labor rights, Indigenous autonomy, LGTBQ rights, universal healthcare, basic income, and affordable housing. These movements contribute to a growing awareness that any livable future demands major structural changes. The free market consensus is in decline even in the Global North, with COVID 19 striking a powerful blow (Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). Even President Biden, a conservative centrist, regularly echoes themes from Black Lives Matter, the Green New Deal, and the Sanders and Warren campaigns. Ideas that once seemed as far-fetched have come to appear to many as the only sensible, scientifically grounded, options. The status quo is unrealistic, immoral, omnicidal. It is not a question of whether to transition, but how quickly and democratically we can do so.</p>
