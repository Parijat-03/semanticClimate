<bold>R<sc>Icia</sc> A<sc>Nne</sc> C<sc>Hansky</sc>:</bold> I am a professor of literature in the department of English at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag&#252;ez. Courses at the university resumed approximately forty days after Hurricane Maria decimated the area in 2017, causing more than one hundred thousand people to lose their homes and the largest blackout in U.S. history&#8212;the second largest in the world. We returned to classes with a mandate to ask our students if they were okay. And we found that many of our students were homeless. They were living in the parking lot of the university. They had no food. They could not find family members. I was out of electricity for ninety-six days, living in the dark for all of that time. I came to my project with the belief that my students were owed something. They were owed a space to share what had happened to them.</p>
