<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par47">The results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref> further show that the non-stationary T = 2-year lake level exceeds the stationary 2-year lake level approximately 60% of the time for all models. Subsequently, the 2-year non-stationary lake levels will be equal or lower than the stationary 2-year lake level for the remaining 40% of the time. In the high lake level section of Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>, which are the rare events with low exceedance probabilities in a year, it can be seen that all three non-stationary models are in approximate agreement in terms of the modeled magnitudes. However, the low lake level section of the curves shows that AMS<sub>3</sub>, with evaporation in <italic>&#956;</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>), has the most change in the 2-year lake level quantiles, while AMS<sub>1</sub> and AMS<sub>2</sub> are in approximate agreement. In addition, the results suggest that in any year, the T = 2-year lake level has changed in magnitude and is becoming equal to the more frequently observed lake level with magnitudes similar to the normal AMS.</p>
