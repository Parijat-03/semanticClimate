      <td>role in determining future CO levels through projected changes to sinks and sink fractions. The figure shows changes in carbon storage in response to elevated\n2\nCO (a, b) and the response to climate warming (c, d). Maps show spatial patterns of changes in carbon uptake during simulations with 1% per year increase in CO\n2 2\n(Section 5.4.5.5), and zonal mean plots show distribution of carbon changes is dominated by the land (green lines) in the tropics and Northern Hemisphere and ocean\n(blue lines) in the Southern Hemisphere. Hatching indicates regions where fewer than 80% of models agree on the sign of response. (e) Future CO projections:\n2\nprojected CO concentrations in the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios in response to anthropogenic emissions, results from coupled Earth system\n2\nmodels for SSP5-8.5 and from the MAGICC7 emulator for other scenarios (Section 4.3.1). (f) Future carbon fluxes: projected combined land and ocean fluxes (positive\ndownward) up to 2100 for the SSP scenarios, and extended to 2300 for available scenarios, 5&#8211;95% uncertainty plumes shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 (Sections\n4.3.2.4, 5.4.5.4 and 5.4.10). The numbers near the top show the number of model simulations used. (g) Sink fraction: the fraction of cumulative emissions of CO\n2\nremoved by land and ocean sinks. The sink fraction is smaller under conditions of higher emissions. {Figure 4.3; 5.4.5; Figures 5.25, 5.27 and 5.30}</td>

      <td>Climate change alone is expected to increase land carbon accumulation in the high latitudes (not including permafrost, which is\nassessed in Sections TS.2.5 and TS.3.2.2), but also to lead to a counteracting loss of land carbon in the tropics (medium confidence).\nEarth system model projections show that the overall uncertainty of atmospheric CO by 2100 is still dominated by the emissions\n2\npathway, but carbon&#8211;climate feedbacks (see Section TS.3.3.2) are important, with increasing uncertainties in high emissions pathways\n(Box TS.5, Figure 1e). {4.3.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, 11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3}</td>

      <td>Under three SSP scenarios with long-term extensions until 2300 (SSP5-8.5, SSP5-3.4-OS, SSP1-2.6), ESMs project a change of the\nland from a sink to a source (medium confidence). The scenarios make simplified assumptions about emissions reductions, with\nSSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS reaching about 400 ppm by 2300, while SSP5-8.5 exceeds 2000 ppm. Under high emissions, the transition\nis warming-driven, whereas it is linked to the decline in atmospheric CO under net negative CO emissions. The ocean remains a sink\n2 2\nthroughout the period to 2300 except under very large net negative emissions. The response of the natural aspects of the carbon cycle\nto carbon dioxide removal is further developed in Section TS.3.3.2. {5.4.9}</td>
