<p>Our understandings of &#8216;relational&#8217; are linked to Samkange&#8217;s theory of
<italic toggle="yes">Ubuntu</italic>, which informs a decolonized pedagogy that resists dominant Western
models of education and promotes an African (political) philosophy that is relational:
&#8216;we become human through others&#8217; (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Samkange and
Samkange, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Mugumbate, 2020</xref>, p. 419).
Notably, Ubuntu was the theme of the 2021 World Social Work Day. This idea is expressed more
completely as &#8216;I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am&#8217; (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Mbiti, 1969</xref>, p. 106). The philosophy places value on the
principles of collectivity, mutual support and communalism which we seek to reflect in our
teaching practice. We also link &#8216;relational&#8217; to the Indigenist ontology of
&#8216;relatedness&#8217; (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2008</xref>) where
relatedness does not only refer to people but the relationship between People and Climate, or
People and Land and includes accountability within these relationships. Of significance here is
that all experiences are tied to relatedness, irrespective of contexts.</p>
