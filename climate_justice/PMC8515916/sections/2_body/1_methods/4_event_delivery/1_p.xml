Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this event was held online on March 12, 2021, using the online communication tool &#8216;Zoom Meetings&#8217;. Registration was free of charge and open from the 4th of February to the 11th of March 2021. During the event, each speaker delivered a 30-min presentation, followed by a 15-min &#8216;Question &amp; Answer&#8217; session where participants&#8217; questions, delivered via the chat function, were answered. This was followed by a panel discussion moderated by a guest speaker. MSc and PhD students of the organising committee also shared their research projects via 5-min presentations. Symposium attendees holding a medical license were eligible for 6 Continuous Medical Education (CME) credit points.</p>
