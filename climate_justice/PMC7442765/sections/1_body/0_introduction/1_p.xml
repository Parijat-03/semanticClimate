<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par2">Lakes are critical to the environment, biosphere, and human populations especially in sustaining the socio-economic livelihoods of many rural and poor communities&#8217; worldwide (Dubois et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>, Sayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>). Benefits from lakes include food, water for domestic use and agriculture, reservoirs for hydropower generation, and transportation as well as providing a high recreation value for humans (Vainu and Terasmaa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2014</xref>, Kafumbata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>). However, these lakes have not been spared from the impacts of climate change and variability (CCV) and human-induced effects such as land-cover and land-use changes, urbanization, changes in impervious surfaces and drainage network, deforestation, and mining (Bayazit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Such impacts are well exhibited through lake level variations, which have profound primary influences on the productivity and structure of lake ecosystems (Gownaris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>) thereby bringing a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems (Ye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2017</xref>). In addition, such variations have considerable influence in fields such as engineering design, ecological conservation, and environmental management around a lake region (Cui and Li <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>).</p>
