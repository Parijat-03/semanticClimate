This implies, to a large extent, that the states are also responsible for implementing the PA equitably. Throughout 2020, 2021, and up until the COP26 that will be held in Glasgow, parties belonging to the PA must communicate or update their commitments; and it will be imperative they do this task looking towards achieving the 1.5&#160;&#176;C global goal, constructing their contributions with an equity vision in a global context. Furthermore, countries are strongly encouraged, when communicating or updating their first NDC, to provide the necessary information for the clarity, transparency, and comprehension contained in the Annex I of the additional orientations regarding the mitigation section <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>/CP.21, approved in decision 4/CMA.1 during COP24 (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>).</p>
