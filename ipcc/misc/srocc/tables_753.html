Yet charcoal makes a significant contribution to livelihoods in\nmany areas and thus, in spite of the ecological damage, halting charcoal production is difficult due to the lack of alternative livelihoods\nand/or the affordability of other fuels (Smith et al. 2015; Zulu and Richardson 2013a; Jones et al. 2016a; World Bank 2009b).</td>

      <td>of forest (or agricultural) biomass can contribute to a loss of soil carbon, which can also, in turn, contribute to land degradation (James\net al. 2016; Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009a; Carvalho et al. 2016; Achat et al. 2015b; Stavi and Lal 2015). Removals are limited to levels\nat which problems of soil erosion, depletion of soil organic matter, soil nutrient depletion and decline in crop yield are effectively\nmitigated (Ayamga et al. 2015a; Baudron et al. 2014; Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009b). Application or recycling of residues may, in\nsome cases, be more valuable for soil improvement (medium confidence). Tao et al. (2017) used leftover oil palm fruit bunches and\ndemonstrated that application of 30 to 90 t ha&#8211;1 empty fruit bunches maintains high palm oil yield with low temporal variability.\nA wide variety of wastes from palm oil harvesting can be used for bioenergy, including annual crop residues (Go et al. 2019b; Ayamga\net al. 2015b; Gardner et al. 2018b).</td>

Carbon and nutrient losses can be significant when animal dung\nis dried and burned as cake, whereas using dung in a biodigester provides high-quality fuel and preserves nutrients in the by-product\nslurry (Clemens et al. 2018; Gurung and Oh 2013b; Quinn et al. 2018).</td>

The level of biochar effectiveness varies depending on\nthe kind of feedstock, soil properties and rate of application (Shaaban et al. 2018; Pokharel and Chang 2019). In addition to adding\nvalue to an energy product, the use of biochar offers a climate-smart approach to addressing agricultural productivity (Solomon and\nLehmann 2017).</td>

Improvements in energy access and reduction or elimination of traditional biomass use thus have benefits across\nmultiple SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement) (Masera et al. 2015; Rao and Pachauri 2017; Pachauri et al. 2018; Hoffmann et al.\n2017; Jeuland et al. 2015; Takama et al. 2012; Gitau et al. 2019; Quinn et al. 2018; Ruiz-Mercado and Masera 2015b; Duguma et al.\n2014b; Sola et al. 2016b). Improved energy access contributes to adaptive capacity, although charcoal production itself can also serve\nas a diversification or adaptation strategy (Perera et al. 2015; Ochieng et al. 2014; Sumiya 2016; Suckall et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2016b).</td>
