On the one hand, there is the demand side of the analysis that includes the ecological footprint. The concept of the ecological footprint was originally defined by Wackernagel and Rees in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1996</xref>), and it has been used as an appropriate proxy for recent studies involving environmental analysis (Destek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>). On the other hand, there is the supply side of the analysis that includes the biocapacity. If the biocapacity is higher than the ecological footprint, then the region experiences an ecological reserve, as described by the GFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). Conversely, if a region&#8217;s footprint is higher than the biocapacity, an ecological deficit will be observed (GFN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). The ecological balance is the difference between the biocapacity and ecological footprint. If the resultant number is positive, it indicates an ecological reserve, whereas it depicts an ecological deficit if it is negative (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).</p>
