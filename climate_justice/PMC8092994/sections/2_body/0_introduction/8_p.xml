Often, the funding for these programs is a compilation of federal, state, and local funds with the federal contribution covering the majority of the costs (FEMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">n.d.-d</xref>). These programs and their relationship to renters are discussed in the &#8220;Home buy-out programs and renters&#8221; section.</p>
