<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">SUHI intensity is increasing throughout the study period as evidenced by the temporally structured effect in the model (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and is statistically significant as measured by the 95% credibility envelope. On average, 2003&#8211;2018 witnessed a 0.01 K per year increase in SUHI intensity within the census tracts examined. This aligns with the earlier finding where raw SUHI intensity measurements were shown to be increasing (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The earlier finding showed a statistically significant increase for only Black and White prevalent tracts, but here the increase is shown to be statistically significant across all examined tracts on average. Moreover, the earlier observation, based on raw temperature measurements, did not take into account population density or K&#246;ppen&#8211;Geiger climate zone, variables the ecological regression modeling do account for. Demonstrating that SUHI intensity is increasing through time on average for all population-based groups examined, with a statistically strenuous model, is an important observation and should provide added urgency to mitigation activities directed toward disparities in urban heat exposure.</p>
