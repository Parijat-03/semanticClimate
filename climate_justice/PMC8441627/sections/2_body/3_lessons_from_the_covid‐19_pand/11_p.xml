<p>Hopefully the virus will do what the titanic hurricanes or the hellish wildfires in the Western United States in 2019 couldn&#8217;t do, nor the fires in the Amazon or the toasting of the koala bears in Australia &#8211; make us more respectful of nature and take a more urgent response to the almost unimaginable significance of the present time, being labelled by many as the Anthropocene Era. For the first time in our planet&#8217;s four&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;half billion years of existence, an era is being named after the effect of one species &#8211; humans. Other eras arose out of the planet being entirely covered with ice or a meteorite strike that took down the dinosaurs who dominated animal forms for millions of years. Every species has some effect on the environment and manipulates it to some extent, but our species is unique in our ability to figure out the &#8216;laws of nature&#8217; and manipulate them for our advantage. We have the powers of the gods but lack their wisdom.</p>
