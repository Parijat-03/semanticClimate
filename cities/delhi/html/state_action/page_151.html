The project is being executed in four phases. This would comprise of 395.72 km route in Delhi and balance in adjoining NCR region. Phase I of 65.10 route km has been completed and put to operation in 2006. Phase II of 124.93 km has also been completed and put to operation in 2010. Phase IV of 103.93 km length is in planning stage to be completed by 2021. There is a need to plan and implement High Capacity Bus Corridor, to strengthen the public transport operations. The planning should be based on moving people and not cars. The Bus corridor should be integrated with the existing, under construction, planned metro lines along with transport hubs and Ring Rail stations. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.41" top="504.24"><span x0="72.02" y0="504.24" x1="526.41" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 79.36; y0: 504.24; y1: 516.24; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">To avoid non-destined commercial vehicle load in the City, Supreme Court has directed IA No. 345 in Writ Petition (Civil ) No. 13029 of 1985 in the matter of M.C.

Under this scheme, 457 stage carriage bus routes of Delhi have been divided into 17 distinct clusters. Presently approximately 1,600 cluster buses are operational in 09 clusters. </span></div><div left="72.02" right="526.2" top="337.42"><span x0="72.02" y0="337.42" x1="526.2" style="x0: 72.02; x1: 80.03; y0: 337.42; y1: 349.42; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Currently DTC is the largest public transport entity in the NCR with daily average passengers about 35.37 Lakh during 2015-16. DTC has planned to augment its fleet to 6,900 buses. To accommodate new buses being purchased by DTC, six new bus depots at Gumanhera, Mundela Kalan, Rohini Sector-37, East Vinod Nagar, Bawana Sector-5 and VIU Burari will also be constructed in 2018-19. In the Low Floor Buses it is pertinent to mention here that low floor buses are fitted with Engine Electronic Controls - AL ULE is fitted with CUMMINS B-gas plus engine which is an electronic engine controlled by a microprocessor called "Engine Control Module (ECM)". ECM continuously monitors and analyzes exhaust gases composition based on feedback received from "heated oxygen sensor" which is fitted with after exhaust manifold. In case exhaust gases specification are out of limit, oxygen sensor will provide feedback to ECM which will take corrective actions through a number of electronic actuator e.g. Fuel Control Valve, throttle actuator, etc. There are 2,506 Non AC and 1,275 AC Low Floor Buses for which pollution checking is mandatory after every year. DTC is regularly getting pollution check of all the buses not only as per CMVR i.e. after every three months but even twice a month as per recent directions of NGT. The Delhi Transport Corporation is also planning to use recycled water for washing of buses and installation of ETP in all of depots.  </span></div></body></html>
