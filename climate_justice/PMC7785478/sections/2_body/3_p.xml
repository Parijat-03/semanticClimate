The average amount of water used by a shower is 2.5 gallons per minute, so by shortening your shower by 1 min every day, you save 912 gallons of water a year (U.S. EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). Not bad. However, fracking uses an average of 9.6 million gallons of water for each well (Magill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). This means you would have to shorten your shower every day for 10,536 years to save the same amount of water used to frack a single well. Fracking used nearly 250 billion gallons of water in the USA between 2005 and 2015 (Duke Today <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>) compared to 142 million gallons for public use in the same period (U.S. Geological Survey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>).</p>
