In one study, elevated ambient concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were shown to suppress IgM response to recombinant <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> major surface glycoprotein leading to longer hospital stays <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Although other clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission, intubation, or in-hospital mortality) were not found to be associated with ambient air pollution, more research is needed for this population group <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Among children with perinatal HIV infection, neurocognitive impairment was also linked with chronic exposure to common air pollutants <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Elevated subclinical vascular disease was also associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure among adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV, suggesting the amplifying role of HIV infection in the development of air pollution-induced cardiovascular insults <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Air pollution and HIV infection seem to exhibit independent yet synergistic pro-atherogenic mechanisms. When particulate matter is deposited on epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, cytokine production is induced, which initiates inflammatory signaling cascades that promote atherosclerosis and thrombosis <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Meanwhile, HIV infection also accelerates atherosclerosis by oxidative stress, immune activation, and dysregulation of autophagy <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
