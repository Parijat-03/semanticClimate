While REDD+, in some cases, has enhanced participation of community members in the policy-planning process, fund management, and carbon baseline establishment, increasing project reliability and equity (West 2016), it&#160;is&#160;clear that, in this region, insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities, are probably the major problems for REDD+ implementation (Loaiza et al. 2017). Despite legal and rhetoric recognition of indigenous land rights, effective recognition is still lacking (Aguilar-St&#248;en 2017). The key to the success of REDD+ in the Amazon, has been the application of both incentives and disincentives on key safeguard indicators, including land security, participation, and&#160;well-being (Duchelle et&#160;al.&#160;2017).</span></div><div left="73.54" right="551.8" top="555.54"><span style="x0: 73.54; x1: 79.35; y0: 555.54; y1: 565.04; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.54" y0="555.54" x1="551.8">On the other hand, at the subnational level, REDD+ has been unable to shape land-use dynamics or landscape governance, in&#160;areas suffering strong exogenous factors, such as extractive industries, and in the absence of effective regional regulation for&#160;sustainable land use (Rodriguez-Ward et al. 2018; Bastos Lima et al. 2017b). Moreover, projects with weak &#64257;nancial incentives, engage households with high off-farm income, which are already better off than the poorest families (Loaiza et al. 2015). Beyond operational issues, clashing interpretations of results might create con&#64258;ict between implementing countries or organisations and donor countries, which have revealed concerns over the performance of projects (van&#160;der Hoff et al. 2018) REDD+ Amazonian projects often face methodological issues, including how to assess the opportunity cost among landholders, and informing REDD+ implementation (Kweka et al. 2016). REDD+ based projects depend on consistent environmental monitoring methodologies for measuring, reporting and veri&#64257;cation and, in the Amazon, land-cover estimates are crucial for environmental monitoring efforts (Ch&#225;vez Michaelsen et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="73.54" right="551.72" top="435.56"><span style="x0: 73.54; x1: 75.83; y0: 435.56; y1: 445.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.54" y0="435.56" x1="551.72">In India, forests and wildlife concerns are on the concurrent list of the Constitution since an amendment in 1976, thus giving the central or federal government a&#160;strong role in matters related to governance of forests. High rates of deforestation due to development projects led to the Forest (Conservation) Act (1980) which requires central government approval for diversion of forest&#160;land in any state or union territory.</span></div><div left="73.54" right="551.78" top="375.56"><span style="x0: 73.54; x1: 78.47; y0: 375.56; y1: 385.06; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.54" y0="375.56" x1="551.78">Before 2006, forest diversion for development projects leading to deforestation needed clearance from the Central Government under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation Act) 1980. In order to regulate forest diversion, and as payment for ES, a&#160;net present value (NPV) frame-work was introduced by the Supreme Court of India, informed by the Kanchan Chopra committee (Chopra 2017). The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 requires compensatory afforestation in lieu of forest diversion, and the Supreme Court established the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) which collects&#160;funds for compensatory afforestation and on account of NPV from project developers.</span></div><div left="73.54" right="551.73" top="291.57"><span style="x0: 73.54; x1: 78.99; y0: 291.57; y1: 301.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.54" y0="291.57" x1="551.73">As of February 2018, 6825&#160;million&#160;USD had accumulated in CAMPA funds in lieu of NPV paid by developers diverting forest land throughout India for non-forest use. Funds are released by the central government to state governments for afforestation and conservation-related activities to &#8216;compensate&#8217; for diversion of forests. This is now governed by legislation called the CAMPA Act, passed by the Parliament of India in July 2016. The CAMPA mechanism has, however, invited criticism on various counts in terms of&#160;undervaluation of forest, inequality, lack of participation and environmental justice (Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013).</span></div><div left="73.54" right="551.83" top="219.58"><span style="x0: 73.54; x1: 77.75; y0: 219.58; y1: 229.08; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.54" y0="219.58" x1="551.83">The other signi&#64257;cant development related to forest land was the landmark legislation called the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 or Forest Rights Act (FRA) passed by the Parliament of India in&#160;2007. This is the largest forest tenure legal instrument in the world and attempted to undo historical injustice to forest dwellers and forest-dependent communities whose traditional rights and access were legally denied under forest and wildlife conservation laws. The FRA recognises the right to individual land titles on land already cleared, as well as community forest rights such as collection of forest produce. A&#160;total of 64,328 community forest rights and a&#160;total of 17,040,343 individual land titles had been approved and granted up to the end of 2017. Current concerns on policy and implementation gaps are about strengths and pitfalls of decentralisation, identifying genuine right holders, veri&#64257;cation of land rights using technology and best practices, and curbing illegal&#160;claims (Sarap et al. 2013; Reddy et al. 2011; Aggarwal 2011; Ramnath 2008; Ministry of Environment and Forests and Ministry&#160;and Tribal Affairs, Government of India 2010).</span></div></body></html>
