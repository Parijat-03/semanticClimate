As a result, the problematic influence of experts on participants, which arises from the epistemic imbalance between those groups, might not be sufficiently contained. In the &#8216;French Convention on Climate Change&#8217;, this influence was even actively promoted by some of the experts themselves in that they &#8216;went beyond their role, either unduly pushing for certain measures or discarding others&#8217; (Giraudet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>, p. 10). One way to combine participatory and epistemic demands is to allow participants to appoint experts themselves, as was to some extent done in the case of the French assembly (Mellier-Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Another option, namely extending the whole process of a mini-public, again illustrates the tension between those two demands, as this would reduce the level of inclusion: the longer the process, the more likely it is to exclude groups that simply cannot commit to such an obligation due to their particular life-circumstances. One viable approach to these problems could be to limit the thematic scope of a single mini-public and rather hold several of these processes on more specific issues.</p>
