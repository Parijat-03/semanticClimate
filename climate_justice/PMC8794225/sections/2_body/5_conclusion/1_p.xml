As Extension expands, it can respond to the needs of broader constituencies to build the organizational capacity for a transformed economy and society, or it can continue to support harm reduction in an unequal and destructive system. Neutrality is not an option. Liberation Extension is also an important step toward redefining the public land grant mission to include cultivating response-ability for collaboratively formulating just and sustainable public responses to pressing problems. This is an ethical stance given&#160;the foundation of land grants through Indigenous dispossession and Extension&#8217;s role in creating exclusionary and unsustainable economic systems and empowering reactionary farmer organizations. Working collectively to undo these legacies is the path to creating a more just and sustainable society.</p>
