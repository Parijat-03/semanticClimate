Initiated in 2006, AGRA <italic>showcased</italic> the public&#8211;private partnership (PPP) model, initiated in 2000 via the UN Global Compact to encourage corporate social/sustainable goals in their programming. But AGRA <italic>also showcased</italic> the way in which the PPP served as a mechanism for accessing public funds for private purpose in agro-food ventures. AGRA established an agro-dealer infrastructure (10,000 agro-dealers) encompassing farmers in value-chains comprising agro-inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides) and contracts for delivery of produce to corporate processors and retailers, subsidized by northern donor governments. Its record exemplifies &#8216;disaster capitalism&#8217;: &#8216;AGRA has raised more than $1 billion, mostly from the Gates Foundation, on promises it would double yields and incomes for 30 million African farmers and cut food insecurity in half by 2020. Instead, the number of severely undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by nearly 50 percent since 2006, according to the latest UN hunger report&#8217; (Malkan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>). And its claim to raise agriculture productivity &#8216;has been marginal at best compared with the gains made by agroecological farming in West Africa, with government support&#8217; (Belay and Wise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>).</p>
