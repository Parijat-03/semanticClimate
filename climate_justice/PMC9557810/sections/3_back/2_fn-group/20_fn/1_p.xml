wider process open to other member organizations within HIC that seeks to
elucidate how learning, mobilization, advocacy and action are simultaneously
practised within the Coalition. Since 2021, this process has informed the
development of cross-regional co-learning spaces driven by HIC&#8217;s members. For
more information on this initiative and HIC&#8217;s first co-learning space on
