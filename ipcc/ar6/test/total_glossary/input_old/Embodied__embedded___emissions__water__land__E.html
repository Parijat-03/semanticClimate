This includes emissions [water use, land use] within the country used to produce goods or services for the country’s own use, but also includes the emissions [water use, land use] related to the production of such goods or services in other countries that are then consumed in another country through imports. Such emissions [water, land] are termed ‘embodied’ or ‘embedded’ emissions, or in some cases, (particularly with water) as ‘virtual water use’ (Davis and Caldeira, 2010; Allan, 2005; MacDonald et al., 2015).</p></dd><div>
