In our field, greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used to power laboratories, clinics, data centers, animal facilities, and other buildings; fuel burned during commuting and air travel; embodied carbon in equipment and consumables; and emissions supported by financial holdings associated with the fossil fuel industry. Health care accounts for approximately 5% of national carbon footprints.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In 2019, the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with air travel to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) annual meeting was an estimated 8,646 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, which is approximately the same amount of carbon dioxide released from burning 20,017 barrels of oil.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In comparison, the emissions associated with the virtual conference in 2021 was approximately 1.3 metric tons or 3 barrels of oil.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
