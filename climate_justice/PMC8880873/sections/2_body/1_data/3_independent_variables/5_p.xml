There may be multiple effects on tribes from being located in regions where the wind energy sector is thriving. A high density of turbines reflects a windy climate, but it also indicates political and economic conditions. Wind turbines can proliferate if state and local land-use regulators treat wind energy favorably. We use OE/AAA data to identify all built turbines in each state (outside tribal areas), and we divide that number by the square miles in the state.</p>
