<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Solomon Islands, Burundi, Nepal, Uganda, and Guinea-Bissau have been urged to consider gender, youth, and vulnerable groups in disaster risk assessments and climate action plans. The least developed countries have a very small contribution to GHG emissions yet are at the frontline of the wrath of sea-level rise and climate change. The Central African Republic and Chad emphasize interregional socio-economic equality, human rights, and gender equality in meeting the PA goal. Kiribati (p. 27) and the Solomon Islands (p. 21), two of the smallest contributors to GHG emissions, call their NDC a &#8220;moral imperative&#8221; and urge the major carbon emitters to &#8220;drastically and immediately&#8221; reduce their emissions under the PA.</p>
