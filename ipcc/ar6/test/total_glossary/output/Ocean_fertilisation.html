<p>A proposed carbon dioxide removal (CDR) method that relies on the deliberate increase of nutrient supply to the near-surface ocean with the aim of sequestering additional CO2 from the atmosphere through biological production. Methods include direct addition of micro-nutrients or macro-nutrients. To be successful, the additional carbon needs to reach the deep ocean where it has the potential to be sequestered on climatically relevant time scales.</p>
