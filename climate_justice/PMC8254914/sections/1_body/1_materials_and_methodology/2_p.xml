However, these results have been filtered in the impact analysis to only include articles (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The reason for this is due to the fact that these types of documents adhere to a strict review process that ensures the quality of their content, particularly with regards to the results and conclusions. Finally, information related to migration and climate change has also been filtered by encoding the material obtained and analyzing it.
