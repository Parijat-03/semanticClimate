This financing gap may increase even further due to fiscal drain on resources resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. It is not just the lack of resources that is a problem, but also the lack of accessibility of available resources and the nature of financing mechanisms in use. (GCA,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Murphy &amp; Parry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>; Havemann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Most of financing for adaptation in the context of food system tranformation comes from international public sector finance. The MDBs are a primary channel, having committed almost US$ 15 billion in adaptation finance in 2019 (Joint Report on MDB Climate Finance,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p>
