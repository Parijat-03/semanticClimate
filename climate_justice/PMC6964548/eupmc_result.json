Emerging evidence shows climate change and resultant policies to be worsening gendered social and economic inequities between women and men, with women's participation largely absent in climate change research and decision-making. These dynamics are resulting in negative impacts for women's well-being, with Indigenous and historically marginalized women at increased risk of experiencing health inequities as a result of climate change. To date, public health discourse has largely failed to incorporate gender as a key determinant of health in discussions of climate change impacts on populations. Paralleling this lack of development, the entangled relationship between climate and colonialism tends to be subsumed under the term \"Aboriginality\" within health determinants discourse. This commentary on gender and climate change in Canada is framed within a radical intersectional approach as an alternative course of public health analysis and action aimed at addressing resulting health and power inequities. Following an overview of evidence regarding the gendered impacts of climate change on women's work, roles, agency, and well-being, several possible public health action areas on climate change and gender are highlighted as necessary components for resilient communities capable of meeting contemporary challenges.", "affiliation": "School of Public Health, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Place, Saskatoon, SK, S7K 2Z4, Canada. lewis.williams@usask.ca.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["editorial", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Colonialism"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Women's Health"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Canada"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Health Status Disparities"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Climate Change"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Gender", "Women", "Indigenous"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-018-0031-z"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6964548"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6964548?pdf=render"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-018-0031-z"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2019-06-07", "dateOfCreation": "2018-07-08", "firstIndexDate": "2018-07-08", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2020-02-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-04-01"}
