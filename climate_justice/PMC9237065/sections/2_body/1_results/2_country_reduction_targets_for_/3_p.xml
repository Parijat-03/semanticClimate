For example, an acknowledgment of GDP per capita differences without the 50% emission reduction level cap of the EU commission proposal would require a more stringent reduction from Germany, as would an acknowledgment of inherited benefits, while past success in renewables extension and consideration of historical emissions (more specifically, comparatively larger emission reduction already achieved) indicate the reverse, i.e., lower emission reduction target for this country. An equally divergent result, albeit exactly in the reverse direction for each of these interpretations holds for Hungary, Latvia, Croatia, and Poland. For all the countries in this group, the way the equity dimensions are specified matters for the direction they are impacted.</p>
