There was a huge commitment by all organizations to continue working in a practical way and politically position themselves in the frame of that vision. In this context, the issue of agrarian reform and the defence of territories was stated as playing a very important role in the region. As I mentioned at the beginning, Latin America is one of the regions with the greatest inequality in land distribution, resulting in deforestation and great ecological destruction. Thus, our vision has a strong call for a global, popular and agroecological agrarian reform. When the Chilean representative of the World March of Women presented the political declaration during the global counter-mobilization, this element had great resonance among the participants from other regions.</p>
