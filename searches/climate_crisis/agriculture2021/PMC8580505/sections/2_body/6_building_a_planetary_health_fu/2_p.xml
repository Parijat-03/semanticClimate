<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="para370">If global efforts to address these drivers are inadequate, humans could perpetuate a feedback loop that results in increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence. Therefore, the goals of leaders, the health community, and the conservation community globally should better align now, more than ever. To achieve common goals however, we need to take an integrative One Health approach, which focuses on appropriate fiscal recovery responses, policy, legislation, and regulatory actions that prioritise the safeguarding of biodiversity and ecosystems. Communication across international, regional, and interdisciplinary boundaries at all scales, including a willingness to collaborate, is necessary. Despite the adverse nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis presents some unique positive opportunities, which governments, decision makers, and citizens can leverage. Society must more readily accept the health of biodiversity and ecosystems as a high priority, not only for the preservation of biodiversity, but as a public health measure of global importance to human health and wellbeing. Without immediate and sufficient reform of our response to zoonotic disease emergence and high-impact events, such as the COVID-19 crisis&#8212;including efforts to return to business as usual&#8212;biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health will continue to suffer. As the links and feedback loops between biodiversity and ecosystem health, COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases are becoming clearer, conservation actions and a One Health approach are urgently needed to manage zoonotic risk and avoid further feedback loops that can negatively impact human health, biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
