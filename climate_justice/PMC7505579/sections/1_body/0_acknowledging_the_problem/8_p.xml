<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="p0035">The scientific community has acknowledged that more research is needed in behavioural change, on extremes, and from multiple disciplines and communities, but it does not yet have an integrated analytical framework for doing this. This commentary addresses the gap and proposes a framing for a holistic perspective on the role of human choices and behaviours in influencing the energy transition. Starting from the desires of individuals and communities, and analysing how these interact with the energy landscape, the framework provides direction on how this could lead to systemic change at the macro-level. Below, we highlight the role of societal acceptance and uptake of end-use technologies; the importance of engaging with, learning from and co-developing knowledge and solutions with citizens from non-mainstream communities (i.e. intentional projects and groups that are disinterested or have been systematically marginalised and even excluded from decisions-making processes); and the modelling requirements to assess the decarbonisation potential in shifting lifestyle patterns. In doing so, we emphasise the role of different scientific disciplines and of bodies of knowledge in understanding the micro- and macro-level changes in societal, technological and energy transitions.</p>
