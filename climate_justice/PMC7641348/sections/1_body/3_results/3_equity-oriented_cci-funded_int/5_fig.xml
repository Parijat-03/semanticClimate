Panel (a) considers heat-related tract interventions and panel (b) considers all tract interventions. Both panels consider the same population groupings. Tracts that are listed as both disadvantaged and low income by the state are included only as &#8220;Disadvantaged (Vulnerable under CES)&#8221;. Communities that are &#8220;Neither disadvantaged nor low income&#8221; are not considered vulnerable under CES nor are they low income; they could, however, be considered vulnerable by HHAI and/or SVI. Numbers in the circles represent the percentage change of heat-related projects after the passage of AB 1550.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0240841.g005"/></fig>
