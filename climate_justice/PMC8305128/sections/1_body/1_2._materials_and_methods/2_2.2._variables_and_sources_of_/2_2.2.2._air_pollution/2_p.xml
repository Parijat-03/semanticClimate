<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were estimated for the year 2016 along continental Chile at a 10 km spatial grid that was then interpolated to a resolution of 2 km. Contrary to the health data considered at the communal level, the annual averages for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were considered at a city level. Communes are a minor and basic administrative division of the whole territory; they are not restricted to urban limits and are in general a combination of urban and rural areas. In communes with large rural or unpopulated areas, large differences in concentrations exist between the communal and city average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07409-f001">Figure 1</xref>, see case of Coyhaique II), with the latter being higher and closer to the observations. Therefore, since using the communal average for this study could potentially underestimate the exposure of the population to these pollutants and consequently their health impact, and considering only 12.2% of the population lives in a rural area at a national level according to the national 2017 Census, the city average was used to calculate the concentration of particulate matter instead.</p>
