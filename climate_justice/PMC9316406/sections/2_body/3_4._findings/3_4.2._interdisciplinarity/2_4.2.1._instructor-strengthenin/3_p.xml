Since promoting environmental and climate justice necessitates macro-level program and policy support, the in-class social policy training is specific to social service policies and programs, where the climate change and disaster components may not continually be effectively developed. Hence, GSW-specific macro-level practice encourages the students to collaborate with professionals from other sectors to advocate for policy and program improvement [<xref rid="B3-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the suggested educational and training opportunities should cultivate more macro-level-oriented social workers, who will integrate different societal dimensions to develop interdisciplinary approaches to address the climate change and disaster issues through policy and educational program improvement [<xref rid="B70-healthcare-10-01245" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
