<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">(2) <italic>Meso level applications</italic>: Here, we work with a predefined set of projects that allow for standardized, homogeneous data processing. The sampling (e.g., all projects from a particular platform) can be done through a simple filter applied to the CS Track database. For such a given sample, semantic analyses such as the identification of research areas or SDGs can be performed automatically.</p>
