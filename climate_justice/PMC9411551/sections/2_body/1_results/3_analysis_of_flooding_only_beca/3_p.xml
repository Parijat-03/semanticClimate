First, a parcel&#8217;s location in a higher-income neighborhood is associated with higher odds of that parcel flooding only because of climate change. While this finding suggests greater hazard exposure for residents living in neighborhoods that are more economically well-off, it is also in juxtaposition to the opposite effect for income found in Latina/x/o neighborhoods. Second, multifamily residential parcels (compared to single-family parcels) had lower odds of crossing the flooding threshold of 20&#8201;cm because of climate change-induced impacts. Third, parcels located inside the FEMA 100-year floodplain had greater odds of climate change-attributed flooding. Fourth, older residences had higher odds of flooding only because of climate change.</p>
