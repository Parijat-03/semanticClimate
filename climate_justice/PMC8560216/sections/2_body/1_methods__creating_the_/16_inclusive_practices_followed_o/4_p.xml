For example, guests provide their pronouns. Specific terminology is clarified in the pre-interview such prescribed burn, which is more westernized versus cultural burn, which is a term preferred by Indigenous people. A general approach to developing questions for BGC is that nothing is assumed about the guest speaker. Questions are based on paying attention to the language of the guest and the information that the speaker shares about themselves.</p>
