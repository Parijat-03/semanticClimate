Decomposition analysis revealed that in 15 of 27 periods, this factor reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the country. On the other hand, in the remaining 12 periods, the energy structure effect increased the amount of harmful emissions. On average, the energy structure effect reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the country by 209.9 ktons. The cumulative impact of the energy structure was computed as&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;5668.1 ktons for 2017. Resultantly, the share of energy structure in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was calculated as&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;4.1% for the same year. It is possible to conclude that there was randomness in the effect of energy structure on emissions during the period of review. The share of renewable energy rose from 7.9 to 9.1%, while the share of nonrenewable energy decreased from 92.1 to 90.9% over the 1990&#8211;2017 period (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). This slight increase in renewable energy consumption indicates why the energy structure effect did not reduce the emissions in Australia. The slow transformation from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources created randomness regarding the impact of energy structure effect on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
