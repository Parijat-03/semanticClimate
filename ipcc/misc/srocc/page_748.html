Governance includes all of the processes, structures, rules and traditions that govern; governance processes may be undertaken by actors including a government, market, organisation, or family (Bevir 2011). Governance processes determine how people in societies make decisions (Patterson et&#160;al.&#160;2017) and involve the interactions among formal and informal institutions (Section&#160;7.4.1) through which people articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their legal obligations, and mediate their differences (Plummer and Baird 2013). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="543.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 543.55; y1: 553.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="543.55" x1="307.57">The act of governance &#8216;is a social function centred on steering collective behaviour toward desired outcomes [sustainable climate-resilient development] and away from undesirable outcomes&#8217; (Young 2017a). This de&#64257;nition of governance allows for it to be decoupled from the more familiar concept of government and studied in the context of complex human&#8211;environment relations and environmental and resource regimes (Young 2017a) and used to address the interconnected challenges facing food and agriculture (FAO 2017b). These challenges include assessing, combining, and implementing policy instruments at different governance levels in a mutually reinforcing way, managing trade-offs while capitalising on synergies (Section&#160;7.5.6), and employing experimentalist approaches for improved and effective governance (FAO 2017b), for example, adaptive climate governance (Section&#160;7.6.3). Emphasising governance also represents a shift of traditional resource management (focused on hierarchical state control) towards recognition that political and decision-making authority can be exercised through interlinked groups of diverse actors (Kuzdas&#160;et&#160;al.&#160;2015).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="315.57"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 315.57; y1: 325.07; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="315.57" x1="307.58">This section will start by describing institutions and institutional arrangements &#8211; the core of a governance system (Young 2017)&#160;&#8211; that build adaptive and mitigative capacity.

Nations with &#8216;well developed institutional systems are considered to&#160;have greater adaptive capacity&#8217;, and better institutional capacity&#160;to help deal with risks associated with future climate change (IPCC, 2001, p. 896). Institutions may also prevent the development of adaptive capacity when they are &#8216;sticky&#8217; or characterised by strong path dependence (Mahoney 2000; North 1991) and prevent changes that are important to address climate change (Section&#160;7.4.9).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="579.56"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.1; y0: 579.56; y1: 589.06; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="579.56" x1="566.11">Formal and informal governance structures are composed of these institutionalised rule systems that determine vulnerability as they in&#64258;uence power relations, risk perceptions and establish the context wherein risk reduction, adaptation and vulnerability are managed (Cardona 2012). Governance institutions determine the management of a community&#8217;s assets, the community members&#8217; relationships with one another, and with natural resources (Hurlbert and Diaz 2013). Traditional or locally evolved institutions, backed by cultural norms, can contribute to resilience and adaptive capacity. Anderson et al. (2010) suggest that these are a particular feature of dry land societies that are highly prone to environmental risk and uncertainty. Concepts of resilience, and speci&#64257;cally the resilience of socio-ecological systems, have advanced analysis of adaptive institutions and adaptive governance in relation to climate change and land (Boyd and Folke 2011a). In their characterisation, &#8216;resilience is the ability to reorganise following crisis, continuing to learn, evolving with the same identity and function, and also innovating and sowing the seeds for transformation. It is a central concept of adaptive governance&#8217; (Boyd and Folke 2012). In the context of complex and multi-scale socio-ecological systems, important features of adaptive institutions that contribute to resilience include the characteristics of an adaptive governance system (Section&#160;7.6.6).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="349.58" top="303.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 303.59; y1: 313.09; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="303.59" x1="349.58">There is </span><span style="x0: 351.23; x1: 355.81; y0: 303.59; y1: 313.09; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="351.23" y0="303.59" x1="412.17">high con&#64257;dence </span><span style="x0: 413.82; x1: 416.63; y0: 303.59; y1: 313.09; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="413.82" y0="303.59" x1="566.11">that adaptive institutions have a strong learning dimension and include:</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="267.59"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.61; y0: 267.59; y1: 277.09; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="267.59" x1="566.09">1.

Government-supported networks, learning platforms, and facilitated interchange between actors with boundary and bridging organisations, creating the necessary self-organisation to prepare for the unknown. Through transparent, &#64258;exible networks, whole sets of complex problems of land, food and climate can be tackled to develop shared visions and critique land and food management systems assessing gaps and&#160;generating solutions.2. Institutions advancing learning by experimentation (in interpretation of information, new ways of governing, and treating policy as an ongoing experiment) through many interrelated decisions, but especially those that connect the social to the ecological and entail anticipatory planning by considering a longer-term time frame. Mechanisms to do so include ecological stewardship, and rituals and beliefs of indigenous societies that sustain ES.</span></div></body></html>
