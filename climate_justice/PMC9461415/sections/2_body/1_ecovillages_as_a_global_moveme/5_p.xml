Therefore, the search for alternatives to face these interconnected challenges deserves broader analytical scrutiny from multiple angles and perspectives over the usual power devices and the meaning of development itself. As argued by post-development scholars, like Escobar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>) and Sachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1992</xref>), development, as we know it, is unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed.</p>
