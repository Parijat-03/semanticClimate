Examples of cross-jurisdictional sharing of public health services include sharing specialized staff (e.g., an epidemiologist) or a service (e.g., laboratory testing) among LHDs [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As increasing rural LHD capacity is likely to take years, shared service arrangements can help immediately bridge gaps in expertise necessary to tackle urgent climate and health challenges [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, as neighboring communities are likely to face similar climate change impacts and associated public health consequences, shared service approaches to emergency response planning can expand capacity of adjacent rural LHDs to focus on climate-related issues [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, two rural New York counties&#8217;&#8212;Genesee and Orleans&#8212;shared service arrangement was reported to result in expansion of capacity to respond to public health emergencies, reduced personnel costs, increased expertise among staff, and a successful application to the CDC for a public health associate (which provided two years of research and analysis that supported both counties) [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-13651" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
