It simulates the physical&#8211;chemical processes of the different atmospheric pollutants based on emissions from the main anthropogenic sectors: residential, transportation, industry, and energy. This modeling system has been successfully applied to simulate the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants in central and southern Chile as well as the exposure to particulate matter of public transport users [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
