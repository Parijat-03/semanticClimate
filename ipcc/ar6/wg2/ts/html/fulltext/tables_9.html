      <td>Risk in this report is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of\nvalues and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions\nbetween climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of\nclimate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential\ntrade-offs or negative side-effects. Risk management is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or\nmagnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}</td>

      <td>Vulnerability is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity\nor predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility\nto harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and\nassessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included&#8212;and often started\nwith&#8212;exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual\ndeterminants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across\ncontexts. Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time. In WGII\nAR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature,\nboth critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, exposure is defined as the presence of people;\nlivelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets\nin places and settings that could be adversely affected. Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as\nmore dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}</td>

      <td>Adaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in\norder to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate\nand its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails\na process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive,\nautonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation. Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages:\n(a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Government, non-government, and\nprivate-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five\ngeneral stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also\ninvolves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation\noptions can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so-\ncalled green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees). The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related\nresponses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-\nscale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation. {1.2.1, 17.4}</td>

      <td>Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend\nor disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining\nthe capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum\nof meanings. Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity and, thus, risk, and resilience as a\nstrategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and transformation. Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience\nas bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}</td>
