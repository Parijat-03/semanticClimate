This community is experiencing sea-level rise and increased flood events, and the potential for climate change impacts to exacerbate existing inequalities is considered high. After a flooding in 2015, a local initiative to strengthen the connection between local care networks and residents was established. The event included a biannual event and allowed for processes of care to happen during which structural relationships could be re-worked and become more just (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Bond and Barth, 2020</xref>). Caring is incremental to sustainable and just adaptation, while current understandings of climate justice are too narrow in epistemological terms (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Bond and Barth, 2020</xref>). Systematic critical theory, such as Marxist theory, with thick explorations of aspects such as hegemonic structures, power or hierarchy tend to overlook epistemological and cultural diversity, while the interdisciplinary framework of social-ecological systems (SES) often fails to include social systems complexity such as values and human agency. This becomes problematic in cases in where analyses of SES limits the focus and underrepresent the role of justice and power (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Bond and Barth 2020</xref>).</p>
