The reasons are that there is inadequate mitigation taking place globally, the frequency and magnitude of climate disasters are increasing, and the climate justice movement is strengthening (Khan and Roberts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 &#176;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>) acknowledged that &#8220;Warming of 1.5 &#176;C is not considered &#8216;safe&#8217; for most nations and poses significant risks to natural and human systems,&#8221; and that &#8220;The benefits from industrialization have been unevenly distributed and those who benefited most historically also have contributed most to the current climate problem and so bear greater responsibility.&#8221;</p>
