<dd class="p-2 fs-6 border shadow ms-2 mb-3"><p class="fs-6 p-2 mb-0">The leading mode of large-scale atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic basin characterized by alternating (see-saw) variations in sea level pressure or geopotential height between the Azores High in the subtropics and the Icelandic Low in the mid- to high latitudes, with some northward extension deep into the Arctic. It is associated with fluctuations in the strength and latitudinal position of the main westerly winds across a vast North AtlanticâEurope domain, and thus with fluctuations in the embedded extratropical cyclones and associated frontal systems leading to strong <em>teleconnection</em> over the entire North Atlantic adjacent continents. The positive and negative phases of the NAO show similar characteristics described for the <em>Northern Annular Mode (NAM)</em>. See Section AIV.2.1 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.</p></dd>
