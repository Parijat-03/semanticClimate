<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Canadian Federation of Medical Students&#8217; Health and Environment Adaptive Response Taskforce (CFMS HEART) has developed planetary health medical educational competencies, which includes 11 competencies distributed into three foundational domains: 1) Advancing Planetary Health Justice, 2) Managing and Preventing Health Impacts, and 3) Leading and Collaborating on Mitigation and Adaptation.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These competencies were developed through literature review, consultation with interdisciplinary experts in planetary health, and curriculum mapping onto the national accreditation standards for Canadian physicians and the CanMEDS roles, an internationally recognized competency framework for medical practice.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Each competency is operationalized into a skill that future physicians can harness to weave planetary health principles into their future clinical practice, advocacy, leadership, and scholarship. Further, the competencies acknowledge the climate crisis as inherently a justice issue. Marginalized communities continue to be disproportionately affected by climate change, despite having contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions. Marginalized voices have also been historically underrepresented and overlooked in climate action efforts, despite the fact that Indigenous communities worldwide have been environmental stewards since time immemorial. Therefore, the competencies are framed from a climate justice lens and with an aim to meaningfully center Indigenous ways of knowing. Emphasizing justice and Indigenous perspectives prepares medical learners to provide care that optimizes both the social and environmental determinants of health, and that harnesses traditional approaches to reduce the environmental harms of healthcare.</p>
