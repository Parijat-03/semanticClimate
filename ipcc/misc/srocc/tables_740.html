      <td>for agricultural land, despite increases in per capita food consumption. This land can instead be used for reforestation, afforestation\nand bioenergy. In contrast, SSP3 has high population and strongly declining rates of crop yield growth over time, resulting in increased\nagricultural land area. SSP2 falls somewhere in between, with societal as well as technological development following historical\npatterns. Increased demand for land mitigation options such as bioenergy, reduced deforestation or afforestation decreases availability\nof agricultural land for food, feed and fi bre. In the climate policy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, bioenergy/BECCS and\nreforestation/afforestation play an important role in SSP1 and SSP2. The use of these options, and the impact on land, is larger in scenarios\nthat limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 1.9 W m&#8211;2 than in the 4.5 W m&#8211;2 scenarios. In SSP3, the expansion of land for agricultural\nproduction implies that the use of land-related mitigation options is very limited, and the scenario is characterised by continued deforestation.</td>

For each pathway, the shaded areas show the range across all IAMs; the line indicates the median across models. There is no SSP3 in\nthe top row, as 1.9 W m&#8211;2 is infeasible in this world.
