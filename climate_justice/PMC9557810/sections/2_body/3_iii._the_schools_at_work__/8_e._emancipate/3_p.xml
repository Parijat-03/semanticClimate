emancipation critical to urban equality. As a pedagogy, to emancipate does not
just evoke a destination but a journey; a journey through which the capacities
to dare and to imagine a different city are activated. This intention
counteracts the pursuit of liberal and andragogical theories of learning and
brings to the fore the development of a critical consciousness that exposes and
confronts the oppressive structures which confine and limit our experience of
the urban and of the right to the city.</p>
