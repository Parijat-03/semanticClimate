As a more concrete example, Holland discusses driving SUVs as an instantiation of the capability for bodily integrity, which includes &#8216;being able to move freely from place to place&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 147). Most governments provide alternative transportation opportunities for people who cannot afford SUVs in the form of, for instance, public transport. However, the SUV owner can move more freely than those restricted to public transport. Applying the capability ceiling concept, a government can provide different incentives that redirect resources in a manner &#8216;that will secure threshold levels of capabilities for people who experience mobility conditions that are below the threshold level that justice requires&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 148). Practically, this could mean, for instance, imposing a SUV tax, the revenues of which &#8216;would go toward improving the availability of public transportation for those who currently lack access to basic means of mobility&#8217; (Holland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>: 148).</p>
