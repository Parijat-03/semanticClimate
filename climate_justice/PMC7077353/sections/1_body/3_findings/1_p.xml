First, we discuss differences in women&#8217;s gender interests in maize-wheat technologies by ethnicity/religious affiliation and socio-economic class. Second, we explore the drivers which facilitate or deny women opportunities to meet their gender interests. Third, we examine the strategies women use to secure inclusion in wheat&#8211;maize innovations. We do not discuss the position of low-income Santal and Muslim/Hindu men, who are not targeted for any training in wheat&#8211;maize innovations. Further research on the implications for intra-household discussion processes and for the sustainable adoption of new technologies, when low-income women but not low-income men are targeted, is required.</p>
