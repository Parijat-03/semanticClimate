For a clear differentiation between findings in laboratory and field studies, the term &#8216;acclimation&#8217; is used in ecophysiology for the respective phenomena when observed in well-defined experimental settings. The term &#8216;(adaptive) plasticity&#8217; characterises the generally limited scope of changes in phenotype that an individual can reach through the process of acclimatisation.</p></div></dd><div>
