Irrigation in India occurs prior to the start of the monsoon season and the resulting land cooling decreases the land-sea temperature contrast. This can delay the onset of the Indian monsoon and decrease its intensity (Niyogi et&#160;al. 2010; Guimberteau et&#160;al. 2012). Results from a modelling study by De Vrese et&#160;al. (2016) suggest that part of the excess rainfall triggered by Indian irrigation falls westward, in the horn of Africa. The theory behind those local and downwind changes in rainfall support the &#64257;ndings from the models, but we do not yet have suf&#64257;cient literature to robustly assess the magnitude and exact location of the expected changes driven by irrigation.</span></div></body></html>
