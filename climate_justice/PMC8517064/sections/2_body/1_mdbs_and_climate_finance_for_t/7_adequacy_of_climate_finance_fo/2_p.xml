This is evidenced in the Ceres 2030 work calling for more than doubling the donor financing to food and agricultural sector development as well as a major increase in financing from both the domestic public sector and a huge increase in private sector spending. As for adaptation specifically, the cumulative climate finance tracked for agriculture, forestry, and land use was only USD 20 billion per year in 2017/2018, representing 3% of the total tracked global climate finance for the period (CPI,&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>). Tracking the amount that have actually been committed to climate finance is complicated, since definitions and boundaries are not clearly identified or agreed upon. In particular, differentiating between climate finance and ODA has proven controversial, over the inclusion of development resources redirected to climate finance and relabeling of ODA as climate finance, raising doubts as to its additionality (Yeo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>).</p>
