Indigenous cosmologies or philosophies of life are known for positioning all forms of life&#8212;animals, plants, trees, bacteria, viruses&#8212;as part of one whole biosphere or ecology (Gebara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>; Gram-Hanssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2021</xref>). Beyond indigenous cosmologies, modern and western science and scholars also increasingly question the human&#8211;nature duality, stressing the importance of epistemic plurality (Biermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Pascual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>).</p>
