As a result of new projects, the country&#8217;s natural gas production substantially increased in recent decades (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). Australia&#8217;s natural gas consumption increased from 8655 to 12,936 ktoe between 1990 and 2017 (IEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>), which represents an increase of 49.5%. Australia&#8217;s dry natural gas production increased faster than consumption over the past three decades. According to an EIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>) report, Australia became the leading LNG exporting country in the Asia&#8211;Pacific region. Japan, China, and South Korea were the largest consumers of Australia&#8217;s LNG, and they accounted for 51%, 28%, and 11% of LNG exports in 2016, respectively (EIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The country&#8217;s LNG exports are expected to be higher in the following years because of the anticipated increase in the production of natural gas and new LNG capacities.</p>
