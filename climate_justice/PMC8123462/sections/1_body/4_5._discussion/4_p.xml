While common climate crises may differ based on region (e.g., forest fires, flooding, droughts, landslides, tsunamis, sea-level rise, ice melt, etc.) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the occurrence of climate change-related mental health stressors on children and youth seems consistent. This speaks to the importance of global awareness of health professionals to the impact that climate events can have on children and youth [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The global climate action school strikes reveal that children and youth are concerned about the climate crisis and are calling for change all around the world [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additional importance is that of social, political, and economic contexts which vary by region. These various factors contribute to the impact that climate change has on economic and housing stability, food sources, education obtainment, violent events, social interaction, connection to culture, disease prevalence, and displacement, among others [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-04573" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Despite these contextual differences, using an intersectional lens to acknowledge the role of climate change in the mental health and subsequent life course functioning of children and youth is paramount.</p>
