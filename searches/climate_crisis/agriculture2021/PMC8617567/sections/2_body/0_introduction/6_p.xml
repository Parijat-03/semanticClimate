<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Patterns of human visitation to parks and open space is highly related to the spatial proximity to the parks, which is known as the theory of &#8220;distance decay&#8221;: Distance can have negative impacts on visitations to parks and tourism destinations (Xiao, Zhang, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; J. Zhang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, given dual effects of COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and wildfires in 2020 summer to early fall, the spatial patterns of people's mobility to parks might change and can be different from the mobility patterns affected by a single crisis. Previous studies have focused on the human mobility to parks during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemics or under wildfire seasons separately (Kim &amp; Jakus,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kupfer et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, the estimation of the compound effects and their interplay on human mobility to parks remain unknown. Understanding people's social and recreation behaviors under multiple severe crises might help provide insights in preparing and mitigating future threats to people's health and wellbeing.</p>
