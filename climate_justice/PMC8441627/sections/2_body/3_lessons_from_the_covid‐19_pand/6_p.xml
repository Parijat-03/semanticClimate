<p>President Trump made an important contribution to addressing social and environmental ills by highlighting significant aspects of the American shadow. Many psychologists publicly diagnosed Trump as a malignant narcissist, but his power goes beyond that into the archetypal domain of the Trickster. He is a self&#8208;described &#8216;stable genius&#8217;, but we must recognize his &#8216;gift&#8217; &#8211; he is an evil genius. He has a unique gift of continual lying that undercuts facts and a trust in anyone but him. Hitler had such a gift. The Greeks recognized the Trickster as sacred in the form of the god Hermes; Mercury to the Romans. Hermes can &#8216;lead the way or lead astray&#8217;. We see this most clearly with Hermes as god of advertising. Drug companies pour millions of dollars into promoting drugs on TV, while having to tell the viewer that they might become suicidal, their immune system could be comprised and make them more vulnerable to diseases, or they could suffer serious internal bleeding. Trump brought all his tricks to bear in his mishandling of the COVID&#8208;19 crisis but the death toll does not lie &#8211; it is not fake news. An important function of the Trickster is to hold up a mirror to a society to show it the ugly truths about itself.</p>
