Of course, new transmission lines could be added but along with increased costs, this requires cumbersome regulatory processes, and sometimes dealing with local NIMBY dynamics. Scholars note that the development of a &#8220;smart grid&#8221; could relieve network congestion. Historically, transmission ratings (thermal ratings to ensure that lines do no overheat when they transmit electricity) tend to be based on fixed weather conditions. Because such weather conditions can change (such as temperature in lower than assumed in the calculations), the actual transmission capacity might remain underutilized. This also could lead to the idling of wind farms when they could be generating electricity and earning revenue. However, the development of new sensory technology such as dynamic thermal rating system can help relieve grid congestion [<xref rid="pone.0261752.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261752.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The idea is that instead of assuming a fixed transmission capacity for the line (which often based on conservative assumptions about weather), the actual capacity can be assessed by sensors that track local weather conditions. Whenever there is a gap between assessed capacity and the real capacity, wind facilities that might have been idled due to network congestion, can be activated. If tribal wind energy is impeded by network congestion issue, the development of smart grid technologies could help improve the uptake of wind energy in native tribal lands.</p>
