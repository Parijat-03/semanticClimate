Through recent commitments and innovations in financing approaches MDBs are already indicating important shifts in their approaches that can lead to improvements in the coordination and effectiveness of adaptation financing to support transformation of currently vulnerable and poor agri-food based livelihoods to ones that provide a decent standard of living and are resilient to climate change. Enlarging and expanding upon such shifts in the next few years will be key to realizing this objective.</p>
