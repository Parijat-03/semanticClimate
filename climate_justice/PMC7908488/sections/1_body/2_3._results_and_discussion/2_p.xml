<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Large thermal inequities existed for all of the urban regions we investigated. Low-income and Latinx populations were the most impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f004">Figure 4</xref>). On average, we found the poorest 10% of neighborhoods in each region to be about 2.2 &#176;C (4 &#176;F) hotter than the wealthiest on both extreme heat days and average summer days. The difference was as high as 3.3 to 4 &#176;C (6&#8211;7 &#176;F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-00941-f004">Figure 4</xref>) in California metro areas such as Palm Springs and the Inland Empire. The neighborhoods that had the smallest differences were seen in Albuquerque and El Paso, which also were the cities with the highest Latinx populations at 47.6% for Albuquerque and 83.6% for El Paso.</p>
