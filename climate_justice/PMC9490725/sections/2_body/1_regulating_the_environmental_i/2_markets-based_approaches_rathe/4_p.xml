<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par15">Green (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>: 449) argues that &#8220;fossil fuel bans are better understood to be motivated by a &#8216;logic of appropriateness&#8217;: by a sense of what is right, natural, expected or legitimate for an agent with a given identity in a given situation, irrespective of cost&#8211;benefit calculation. Bans send a clear signal that practices of large-scale fossil fuel exploitation are categorically wrong, and implicitly cast aspersions on the moral character of actors who engage in such practices&#8221;. He argues further that these strong policies make further policy making easier by changing the norms: &#8220;each new ban helps to redefine morally appropriate behaviour for states, and thus helps to build a global &#8216;anti-fossil fuel norm&#8217; proscribing the banned activity. As the number of states banning an activity rises, the social costs of non-conformity (for instance, a tarnished international reputation) increase, making it more likely, all else being equal, that other states will adopt a similar ban&#8221; (Green, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>: 449). Green concedes the problem of leakage, in that one country may ban it but another may take advantage by allowing it, yet argues that any carbon policy&#8212;including MBMs&#8212;entails the risk of leakage. Moreover, this serves as a further argument to select a policy that uses normative influence to increase &#8220;social costs&#8221; on other countries and hence reduces leakage, which MBMs do not. Bans are also less complex in operation than other mechanisms, not requiring the same administrative complexities of measuring, reporting, monitoring and enforcing.</p>
