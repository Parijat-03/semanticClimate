<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par49">Variations in the levels of Lake Malawi are already having considerable impacts to the livelihoods of the riparian communities and the socio-economic development of Malawi. Since the peak of 1979/1980, a downward pattern of the levels is evident from the empirical record. Consequently, the lake levels cannot be assumed to be stationary. However, there is no documented study in the literature that has attempted to account for this trend. In this study, new FFA approaches incorporating non-stationary have therefore been applied to the lake levels to understand and compared with those from traditional stationary methods. A multi-model framework ranging from the following: change point and trends analysis, series (AMS or PDS); pdfs (Gumbel, GEV, PE3, GPA, and exponential); parameter fitting (MLE; GMLE, Bayesian, and L-Moments); and covariates (rainfall, discharge, evaporation, IOD, and SOI) was used to identify the best approach for modeling the frequency of the lake levels. Based on commonly used model evaluation criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC, and LR tests), the model with the GEV when fitted to the AMS using the MLE was the best performing among the candidate distributions as opposed to the GPA on POT series. In addition, open water evaporation was found to be the most dominant covariate to the location parameter (&#956;) of the non-stationary GEV distribution, followed by rainfall over the lake and river discharge. All covariates were found to have no significant influence on the scale parameter (<italic>&#963;</italic>). However, the IOD and SOI, large-scale low climate variability indices in the area, had non-significant impact on the variation of the lake levels. The results suggest that non-stationary models are more ideal in the evolution of lake quantiles and should be incorporated in infrastructural design and flood zone planning among others.</p>
