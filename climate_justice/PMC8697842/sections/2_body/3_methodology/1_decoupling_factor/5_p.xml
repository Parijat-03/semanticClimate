This kind of analysis provides information about the continuous economic growth and sustainable environment dilemma for the countries. In addition to the real income, there is one more main factor that contributes to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, namely, population. Therefore, in this study, the existence of decoupling between population and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be also investigated.</p>
