<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">What could such an evaluation process look like? <xref ref-type="table" rid="healthcare-04-00065-t002">Table 2</xref> presents guiding questions to assess potential impacts of measures taken. In brief, each domain and indicator need to be conceptualized for the specific context and community by (a) assessing the status quo, and (b) contemplating what changes to which the adaptation measure might lead. The framework requires careful conceptualization of the questions to ask to be able to provide a guide for adaptation design and evaluation. The guided questions listed here serve merely as a starting point that should be amended and added to as befits the particular situation. Situation specific response categories can be developed beforehand, such that applicability by different persons, professions and institutions in a country can be secured. Additionally, all adaptation work depends on prior risk and impact analysis within the specific context and situation. Results of these analyses will then help further refine the question template. These questions can only be thoroughly answered by applying a combined approach of strategy document analysis and interviews. As several of these questions require an in-depth analysis of context and target groups, for example, the questions on safety of green spaces or participation processes, they will ideally be refined and answered jointly by stakeholders and researchers.</p>
