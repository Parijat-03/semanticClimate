The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is causing unprecedented disruptions to health systems, but climate change will have even greater&#8212;much greater&#8212;consequences. Yet health policy and systems researchers largely continue to ignore and overlook climate change. This is a critical oversight. Countries with the greatest vulnerability to climate change have the least developed health systems (<xref rid="czaa165-B19" ref-type="bibr">Salas and Jha, 2019</xref>), and climate change will further compound and exacerbate existing inequalities (<xref rid="czaa165-B3" ref-type="bibr">Costello <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is well positioned to accelerate the needed response and transformation (<xref rid="czaa165-B14" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2018</xref>). HPSR could make countless contributions to address the climate challenge. We highlight three interlinked reasons, which should motivate the HPSR community to prioritize a focus on climate change.</p>
