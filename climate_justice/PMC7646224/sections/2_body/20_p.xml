Specifically, the findings show that public support for climate mitigation increases when climate policy includes socioeconomic reforms like affordable housing, a job guarantee, and increasing the minimum wage. The research also shows that connecting climate policy to economic and social issues is particularly useful for expanding support for climate action among people of color.</p>
