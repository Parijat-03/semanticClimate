We performed a search in these case documents to quantify the number of times that the word health was explicitly used in this litigation. We used the case data to identify climate litigation with a legal strategy, where the plaintiff relied on climate science and public health as part of a systematic challenge to a field of law. This resulted in 65 cases categorized as public health climate litigation, where public health was part of the litigation strategy.</p>
