Several voices have already called for this step. At the opening plenary of the World Health Assembly in Geneva in May 2019, the editor of the <italic>Lancet,</italic> Richard Horton, urged member states and WHO secretariat to &#8220;declare a planetary emergency.&#8221;<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A couple of days later, during a side event on air pollution, climate change, oceans, and health sponsored by the Swedish government, the minister of health for the Seychelles, Jean Paul Adam, argued forcefully that: &#8220;we have to recognise that climate change is a public health emergency at the international level.&#8221; We examine how WHO could and should use the authority it derives from its constitution and the International Health Regulations to declare climate change an international public health emergency.</p>
