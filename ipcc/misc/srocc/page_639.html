How the different options impact progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be a useful shorthand for looking at the social impacts of these response options. Similarly, looking at how these response options increase or decrease the supply of ecosystem services/Nature&#8217;s Contributions to People (NCP) (see&#160;Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 6) can be a useful shorthand for a more comprehensive environmental impact beyond climate and land. Such evaluations are important as response options may lead to unexpected trade-offs with social goals (or potential co-bene&#64257;ts) and impacts on important environmental indicators such as water or biodiversity. Similarly, there may be important synergies and co-bene&#64257;ts associated with some response options that may increase their cost-effectiveness or attractiveness. As we note in Section&#160;6.4.4, many of these synergies are not automatic, and are dependent on well-implemented and coordinated activities in appropriate environmental contexts (Section 6.4.4.1), often requiring institutional and enabling conditions for success and participation of multiple stakeholders (Section 6.4.4.3). </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="411.56"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 411.56; y1: 421.06; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="411.56" x1="313.26">In the following sections and tables, we evaluate each response option against 17 SDGs and 18 NCPs.

However, SDG 13 includes targets for both mitigation and adaptation, so options were weighed by whether they were useful for one or both. On the other hand, the NCP &#8216;regulation of climate&#8217; does not include an adaptation component, and refers speci&#64257;cally to &#8216;positive or negative effects on emissions of GHGs and positive or negative effects on biophysical feedbacks from vegetation cover to atmosphere, such as those involving albedo, surface roughness, long-wave radiation, evapotranspiration (including moisture-recycling) and cloud formation or direct and indirect processes involving biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), and regulation of aerosols and aerosol precursors by terrestrial plants and phytoplankton&#8217; (D&#237;az et&#160;al. 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.21" top="219.58"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.5; y0: 219.58; y1: 229.08; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="219.58" x1="313.21">In all tables, colours represent the direction of impact: positive (blue) or negative (brown), and the scale of the impact (dark colours for large impact and/or strong evidence to light colours for small impact and/or less certain evidence).
