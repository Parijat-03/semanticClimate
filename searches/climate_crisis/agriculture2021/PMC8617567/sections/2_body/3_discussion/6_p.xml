<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Wildfire smoke exposure can have serious impacts on human health, causing direct death, respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal diseases. Smoke can be transported far away from fires and affect people there (Kollanus et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our findings suggested that between June and July, the monthly average of the daily minimum smoke value was positively correlated with the number of visitors but negatively correlated with the dwell time at the parks, indicating that people still visited parks when the daily minimum smoke was quite large but cut the time they stayed in the park. During the major wildfire season, people tended to visit the parks with less smoke and lower toxic gas levels in the western part of the study area. Given that people follow common sense health protection behaviors, people might avoid outdoor recreation, especially people with respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Henderson et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Moore et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Rappold et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Reid et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Additionally, given the growing evidence of associations between wildfire smoke exposure and the increased risk of respiratory infections (Martin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Reid et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="gh2287-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), people are more likely to feel more stress and concerns about wildfire&#8208;induced smoke under the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic.</p>
