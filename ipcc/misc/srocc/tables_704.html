      <td>Sustainable land management (SLM) makes strong social and economic sense. Early action in implementing SLM for climate change\nadaptation and mitigation provides distinct societal advantages. Understanding the full scope of what is at stake from climate change\npresents challenges because of inadequate accounting of the degree and scale at which climate change and land interactions impact\nsociety, and the importance society places on those impacts (Santos et al. 2016) (Sections 7.2.2, 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 4.1). The consequences\nof inaction and delay bring significant risks, including irreversible change and loss in land ecosystem services (ES) &#8211; including food\nsecurity &#8211; with potentially substantial economic damage to many countries in many regions of the world (high confidence).</td>
