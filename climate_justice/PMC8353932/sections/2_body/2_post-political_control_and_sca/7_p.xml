On the one hand, scarcity makes people more attentive and efficient&#8212;it focuses our mind on what appears to matter most at the time. Mullainathan and Shafir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>) called this benefit a &#8216;focus dividend&#8217;. Some could say that the 12-years deadline rhetoric raised a &#8216;focus dividend&#8217; by increasing a sense of urgency of the climate crisis. On the other hand, scarcity comes at the cost of <italic>tunnelling</italic>&#8212;it leads people to neglect other important concerns that seem less urgent than the issue at hand. A strict budget or tight deadline creates its own narrow focus, and considerations other than managing scarcity fall outside the &#8216;tunnel&#8217; (the scope of attention).</p>
