However, the risks associated with demanding and implementing such emergency powers become apparent when considering that the climate crisis is a permanent crisis that cannot simply be stopped or reversed by adopting a specific set of &#8216;right measures&#8217;. Instead, it is much more a matter of preventing the worst catastrophe and, beyond that, dealing with the new conditions&#8212;an adaptation that can hardly be achieved without drawing on the evidence and support base of the democratic demos itself. More importantly, from the perspective of a normative democratic theory that understands democratic governance as self-government, reducing political decision-making in the name of &#8216;truth-tracking&#8217; in order to achieve solutions that are rational in a scientific sense constitutes an illegitimate &#8216;expertocratic shortcut&#8217; (Lafont <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>, p. 78).</p>
