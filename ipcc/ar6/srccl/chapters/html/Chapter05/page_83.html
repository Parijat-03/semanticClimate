The principal route is by affecting agricultural commodity markets, which respond to a&#160;perturbation through multiple routes as in Figure&#160;5.17. This includes pressures from other sectors (such as, if biofuels policy is incentivising crops for the production of ethanol, as happened in 2007&#8211;2008). The market response can be amplified by poor policies, setting up trade and non-trade barriers to exports, from countries seeking to ensure their local food security (Bailey et al. 2015). Furthermore, the perception of problems can fuel panic buying on the markets that in turn drives up prices. </span></div><div left="83.2" right="327.75" top="627.12"><span style="x0: 83.2; x1: 87.41; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="83.2" y0="627.12" x1="327.75">Thus, the impact of an extreme weather event on markets has both a&#160;</span><span style="x0: 327.78; x1: 330.6; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="327.78" y0="627.12" x1="353.4">trigger </span><span style="x0: 353.4; x1: 357.09; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="353.4" y0="627.12" x1="472.35">component (the event) and a&#160;risk </span><span style="x0: 472.44; x1: 477.01; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="472.44" y0="627.12" x1="512.03">perception </span><span style="x0: 512.03; x1: 515.73; y0: 627.12; y1: 636.62; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="512.03" y0="627.12" x1="554.02">component (Challinor et al. 2016, 2018). Through commodity markets, prices change across the world because almost every country depends, to a&#160;greater or lesser extent, on trade to fulfil local needs. Commodity prices can also affect local market prices by altering input prices, changing the cost of food aid, and through spill-over effects. For example, in 2007&#8211;2008 the grain affected by extreme weather was wheat, but there was a&#160;significant price spike in rice markets (Dawe 2010). </span></div></body></html>
