# 6.1 Introduction 

The global energy system is the largest source of CO2 emissions (Chapter 2). Reducing energy sector 
emissions is therefore essential to limit warming. The energy systems of the future will be very different 
from those of today if the world successfully limits warming to well below 2°C. Energy will be 
provided, converted, and used in different ways than it is today (Figure 6.1). Achieving and responding 
to these changes presents an impressive range of challenges and opportunities.

Database. Flows below 1 EJ are not represented, rounded figures. The illustrative net zero scenarios 
correspond to the years in which net energy system CO2 emissions reach zero – 2045 in IP1 and 2060 in 
IP2. Source: IP1: Luderer et al.(2021); IP2: Riahi, K. et al., 2021;IP2 67
Within this context, this chapter has two main objectives. First, it aims to assess specific, individual 
mitigation options in energy supply, energy transformation, and energy transportation and transmission. 
This assessment is complementary to a set of chapters that explore mitigation options in agriculture, 
forestry, and other land uses (Chapter 7), urban systems and other settlements (Chapter 8), buildings 
(Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10), industry (Chapter 11), and cross-sectoral perspectives (Chapter 12). 
Second, this chapter aims to assess system-level mitigation opportunities and challenges across the 
entirety of energy systems. These systems include energy supply, transformation, transmission, storage, 
transportation, and end-uses. They also include the societal systems that interact with the physical 
energy system. As energy systems become increasingly integrated and interconnected, a system-wide 
perspective is necessary for understanding mitigation opportunities and challenges. 
Within this context, this chapter addresses six topics, each of which is addressed in a separate section. 
First, Section 6.2 defines the scope of the energy system. Section 6.3 then discusses the recent trends in 
energy systems that might exert the most significant influence on energy system evolution and options 
for reducing emissions. Section 6.4 assesses the status and potential of individual energy supply, 
transformation, storage, transportation and transmission, and integration mitigation options in the 
energy sector. Section 6.5 explores how climate change might affect energy systems and alter potential 
energy system mitigation options and strategies. Section 6.6 identifies key characteristics of net zero 
energy systems – those that emit very little or no CO2. Section 6.7 explores transition pathways toward 
and through net zero energy systems. Across all of these sections, the chapter aims to explore the ways 
that energy sector mitigation options and strategies interact with SDGs and other societal and 
environmental goals.
