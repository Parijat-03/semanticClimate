I am a big animal lover&#8221;). Several participants were afraid of massive yet undefined threats. One participant wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about the worst that could happen in my lifetime,&#8221; with the planet becoming &#8220;unlivable in a few decades&#8221; due to the combination of scarce resources and overpopulation, while another wrote, &#8220;Many more animals and insects we need to survive as a population will go extinct. I am more afraid of running out of natural materials because of overpopulation as well.&#8221; Many participants described deadly threats of &#8220;widespread famine,&#8221; and climate change-related disasters such as &#8220;fires and natural storms&#8221; that were expected to &#8220;wipe out populations.&#8221; Others tackled the responsibility of capitalism in what they compared to the murder of millions of persons: &#8220;larger corporations [&#8230;] will kill us all.&#8221;</p>
