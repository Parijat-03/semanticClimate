A very important aspect of any smart village is the effective management of farm economy, achievable through the protection of crops against diseases. Quantum dots offer classical examples of materials that are useful for monitoring plant diseases, as they possess broad excitation spectra. Safarpour et al. [<xref rid="B27-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] identified the vector responsible for sugar beet&#8217;s yellow vein and Rhizomania disease like Polymyxa betae. This was detected using quantum dot techniques that subjected the plant root sap samples to several pre-treatment in order to extract the virus. The quantum dots unit utilizes F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) modeling in its detection operation [<xref rid="B27-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By using a similar technology, Bakhori et al. [<xref rid="B28-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] detected synthetic oligonucleotide of Ganoderma boninense. However, this work employed adjusted quantum dots with carboxylic groups that are then conjugated using a DNA probe. This gave rise to an improved sensitivity of the system, yielding 3.55 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M as the detection limit [<xref rid="B28-sensors-20-05977" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
