In North Asia, the extent of fire-affected areas in boreal forest can be millions of hectares in a single extreme fire year (Duane et&#160;al., 2021) and nearly doubled between 1970 and 1990 (Brazhnik et&#160;al., 2017). During recent decades, the number, area and frequency of forest fires increased in Putorana Plateau (north of Central Siberia), in larch-dominated forests of Central Siberia and in Siberian forests as a whole. This increase is in line with an increase in the average annual air temperature, air temperature anomalies, droughts and the length of fire season (Ponomarev et&#160;al., 2016; Kharuk and Ponomarev, 2017; Pospelova et&#160;al., 2017). The number of forest fires and damaged areas in Gangwon Province and the Yeongdong area in the 2000s increased by factors of 1.7 and 5.6, respectively, compared with the 1990s (Bae et&#160;al., 2020). Climate change is not the sole cause of the increase in forest fire severity (Wu et&#160;al., 2014; Wu et&#160;al., 2018d).

Cherry blossoms are predicted to flower 6.3 and 11.2 d earlier after 2090 according to scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Bae et&#160;al., 2020). On the Tibetan Plateau, it was found that the SOS has advanced and the EOS has been delayed over the past 30&#8211;40&#160;years (Yang et&#160;al., 2017). Using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets and ground-based Budburst data (Wang et&#160;al., 2017c) found no consistent evidence that the SOS has been advancing or delaying over the Tibetan Plateau during the past two to three decades. The discrepancies among different studies in the trends of spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau could be largely attributed to the use of different phenology retrieval methods. An uncertainty exists with the relationship between land-surface phenology and climate change estimated by satellite-derived NDVI because these indices are usually composite products of a number of days (e.g., 16 d) that could fail to capture more details.

In Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the temperature increase over the previous decade promoted radial stem increment of the Siberian larch. However, the simultaneous influence of increased temperature, decreased precipitation and increased anthropogenic pressure resulted in widespread declines in forest productivity and reduced forest regeneration, and increased tree mortality (Dulamsuren et&#160;al., 2013; Lkhagvadorj et&#160;al., 2013a; Lkhagvadorj et&#160;al., 2013b; Dulamsuren et&#160;al., 2014; Khansaritoreh et&#160;al., 2017).
