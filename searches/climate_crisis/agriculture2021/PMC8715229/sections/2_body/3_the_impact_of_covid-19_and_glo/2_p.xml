Social, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities of our food systems became apparent during the rapidly unfolding pandemic in 2020 and the implementation of lockdown and containment measures. The following sections place primary emphasis on the vulnerabilities of food systems exposed during this period, while also highlighting some further developments during 2021. We discuss the consequences of the pandemic for food security and nutrition, illustrate how the pandemic exacerbated inequalities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities embedded in the food system, and then examine the interplay between how the emergence of pandemic has been triggered by land-use change and environmental degradation, while also compounding and being compounded by environmental changes.</p>
