Women have access to fewer income-earning opportunities than men and, thus, are more vulnerable to disruptions in income, exacerbating preexisting inequities.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Investments that empower women and girls can also function as climate justice solutions by increasing reproductive autonomy and sustainable farming practices.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> However, it is useful for interventions to also target men, because men are less likely to access HIV prevention services compared with women despite reporting greater risk for sexual transmission. Because HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa generally occurs through heterosexual sex, HIV-prevention interventions that target men may also lower the prevalence among women.<sup><xref rid="zoi220857r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
