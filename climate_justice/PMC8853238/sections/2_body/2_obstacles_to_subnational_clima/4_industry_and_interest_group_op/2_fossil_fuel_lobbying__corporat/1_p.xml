This creates new opportunities for corporations and their lobbyists to influence climate policy. Initially, the increased authority of states prompted researchers to anticipate a &#8220;race to the top&#8221; with some states setting higher environmental standards (Fiorino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2006</xref>). However, subsequent research showed that the political economy of the environment often generates a &#8220;race to the bottom,&#8221; with some states competing for fossil fuel companies to develop their energy resources (Rabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2013</xref>; Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>; Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>). Furthermore, after states become dependent on employment and tax revenues from the fossil fuel companies, they tend to make concessions to them. Wingfield and Marcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2007</xref>) show that many of the states most dependent on fossil fuel industries have among the weakest environmental policies (e.g., Wyoming, Alabama, North Dakota, West Virginia, Louisiana).</p>
