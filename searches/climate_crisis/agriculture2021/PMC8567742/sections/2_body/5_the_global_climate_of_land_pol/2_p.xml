Front and centre in &#8216;land tenure security&#8217; frameworks is the security of capitalist investors &#8211; not that of working poor people. Yet this concept and practice are contested. How to make it socially legitimate is a challenge. Deininger is keen on striking a balance between capital accumulation and political legitimacy imperatives by way of formalizing land rights, but again, centrally in order to protect the interest of capitalist investments:
<disp-quote specific-use="block"><p>Understanding and respecting these rights is important if investments are to be socially legitimate and legally secure. Failure to do so can lead to conflict and strife that will negatively affect the economic viability of land-related investments. Failure to map and record land rights&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;makes it difficult to identify boundaries and legitimate owners as a basis for engaging in mutually agreed-to land transfers. Recording rights provides outside investors with somebody to talk to, a legitimate and authorized partner to negotiate the nature of investments and compensation.
