<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">At the end of the course, participants described climate change as having more immediate and more personal impacts compared to those impacts they described at the course's beginning (Figure <xref rid="ece35736-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Before the climate change module, most of them did not recognize that climate change was already harming people: Only 33% chose &#8220;now,&#8221; while the remainder selected options describing climate change as beginning to harm people anywhere from within 10&#160;years to after 100&#160;years. By the end of the course, the percentage who selected &#8220;now&#8221; increased to 63% (Figure <xref rid="ece35736-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, <italic>&#967;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#160;=&#160;19.9, <italic>p</italic>&#160;&lt;&#160;.0001). However, even at the end of the course, 8% still thought climate change would not start to harm people until 51&#8211;100&#160;years from now, and 2% thought it would take over 100&#160;years. There was also a significant shift in how participants described the magnitude of the impacts of climate change that they expected to personally experience. Before the climate change module, a plurality of these students (43%) chose &#8220;a moderate amount&#8221; (Figure <xref rid="ece35736-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). However, by the end of the semester, the most common response to this question was &#8220;a great deal&#8221; (41%).</p>
