The first model utilizes mean yearly summertime SUHI intensity by census tract as the response and the percentages of each population group as an explanatory variable. All four population groups had a statistically significant association with average daytime SUHI intensity. Of the independent variables, the Black population percentage had the highest posterior estimated &#946; of 0.42. The Hispanic and Asian population percentages had a mean &#946; of 0.23 and 0.14 respectively. The White population had a negative association with average daytime SUHI intensity with a mean posterior &#946; of &#8722;0.25. The temporally structured effect, &#947;<sub>t</sub>, modeled as a random walk order one, exhibited a statistically significant increase in SUHI intensity through a time of approximately 0.01 K per year on average (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12314-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
