There are several reasons for the slow uptake, but the perception of risks and the time lag between adoption and realisation of bene&#64257;ts are often important (Pattanayak et al. 2003; Mercer 2004; Jerneck and Olsson 2013).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="651.53"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 651.53; y1: 661.03; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="651.53" x1="307.57">An important question for agroforestry is whether it supports poverty alleviation, or if it favours comparatively af&#64258;uent households. Experiences from India suggest that the overall adoption is low, with a&#160;differential between rich and poor households. Brockington el al. (2016), studied agroforestry adoption over many years in South India and found that, overall, only 18% of the households adopted agroforestry. However, among the relatively rich households who adopted agroforestry, 97% were still practising it after six to eight years, and some had expanded their operations. Similar results were obtained in Western Kenya, where food-secure households were much more willing to adopt agroforestry than food-insecure households (Jerneck and Olsson 2013, 2014). Other experiences from Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate the dif&#64257;culties (such as local institutional support) of having a&#160;continued engagement of communities in agroforestry (Noordin et al. 2001; Matata et al. 2013; Meijer et al. 2015).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="261.02" top="459.42"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 459.42; y1: 469.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="459.42" x1="261.02">1.8.1.4 Crop&#8211;livestock interaction as an approach to&#160;managing land degradation </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="423.52"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 423.52; y1: 433.02; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="423.52" x1="307.6">The integration of crop and livestock production into &#8216;mixed farming&#8217; for smallholders in developing countries became an in&#64258;uential model, particularly for Africa, in the early 1990s (Pritchard et al. 1992; McIntire et al. 1992). Crop&#8211;livestock integration under this model was seen as founded on three pillars: improved use of manure for crop fertility management; expanded use of animal traction (draught animals); and promotion of cultivated fodder crops. For Asia, emphasis was placed on draught power for land preparation, manure for soil fertility enhancement, and fodder production as an entry point for cultivation of legumes (Devendra and Thomas 2002). Mixed farming was seen as an evolutionary process to expand food production in the face of population increase, promote improvements in income and welfare, and protect the environment. The process could be further facilitated and steered by research, agricultural advisory services and policy (Pritchard et al. 1992; McIntire et al. 1992; Devendra 2002).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="231.55"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 231.55; y1: 241.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="231.55" x1="307.57">Scoones and Wolmer (2002) place this model in historical context, including concern about population pressure on resources and the view that mobile pastoralism was environmentally damaging. The latter view had already been critiqued by developing understandings of pastoralism, mobility and communal tenure of grazing lands (e.g.,&#160;Behnke 1994; Ellis 1994). They set out a&#160;much more differentiated picture of crop&#8211;livestock interactions, which can take place either within a&#160;single-farm household, or between crop and livestock producers, in which case they will be mediated by formal and informal institutions governing the allocation of land, labour and capital, with the interactions evolving through multiple place-speci&#64257;c pathways (Ramisch et al. 2002; Scoones and Wolmer 2002). Promoting a&#160;diversity of approaches to crop&#8211;livestock interactions does not imply that the integrated model necessarily leads to land </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="735.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.62; y0: 735.58; y1: 745.08; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="735.58" x1="566.13">degradation, but increases the space for institutional support to local innovation (Scoones and Wolmer 2002).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.13" top="699.58"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 699.58; y1: 709.08; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="699.58" x1="566.13">However, speci&#64257;c managerial and technological practices that link crop and livestock production will remain an important part of the repertoire of on-farm adaptation and mitigation. Howden and coauthors (Howden et al. 2007) note the importance of innovation within existing integrated systems, including use of adapted forage crops. Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016) list as adaptation strategies with high potential for grazing systems, mixed crop&#8211;livestock systems or both: crop&#8211;livestock integration in general; soil management, including composting; enclosure and corralling of animals; improved storage of feed. Most of these are seen as having signi&#64257;cant co-bene&#64257;ts for mitigation, and improved management of manure is seen as a&#160;mitigation measure with adaptation co-bene&#64257;ts.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="560.51" top="531.42"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 531.42; y1: 541.42; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: ABIDEK+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="318.05" y0="531.42" x1="560.51">1.8.2 Local and indigenous knowledge for addressing land degradation</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="495.52"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 495.52; y1: 505.02; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="495.52" x1="566.07">In practice, responses are anchored in scienti&#64257;c research, as well as local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and know-how. For example, studies in the Philippines by Camacho et al. (2016) examine how traditional integrated watershed management by indigenous people sustain regulating services vital to agricultural productivity, while delivering co-bene&#64257;ts in the form of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience at a&#160;landscape scale. Although responses can be site speci&#64257;c and sustainable at a&#160;local scale, the multi-scale interplay of drivers and pressures can nevertheless cause practices that have been sustainable for centuries to become less so. Siahaya et al. (2016) explore the traditional knowledge that has informed rice cultivation in the uplands of East Borneo, grounded in sophisticated shifting cultivation methods (</span><span style="x0: 424.2; x1: 428.77; y0: 351.54; y1: 361.04; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="424.2" y0="351.54" x1="457.91">gilir balik</span><span style="x0: 457.92; x1: 460.56; y0: 351.54; y1: 361.04; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="457.92" y0="351.54" x1="566.09">) which have been passed on for generations (more than 200 years) in order to maintain local food production. Gilir balik involves temporary cultivation of plots, after which, abandonment takes place as the land user moves to another plot, leaving the natural (forest) vegetation to return. This approach is considered sustainable if it has the support of other subsistence strategies, adapts to and integrates with the local context, and if the carrying capacity of the system is not surpassed (Siahaya et al. 2016). Often gilir balik cultivation involves intercropping of rice with bananas, cassava and other food crops. Once the abandoned plot has been left to recover such that soil fertility is restored, clearance takes place again and the plot is reused for cultivation. Rice cultivation in this way plays an important role in forest management, with several different types of succession forest being found in the study by Siahaya et al. (2016). Nevertheless, interplay of these practices with other pressures (large-scale land acquisitions for oil palm plantation, logging and mining), risk their future sustainability. Use of &#64257;re is critical in processes of land clearance, so there are also trade-offs for climate change mitigation, which have been sparsely assessed.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.1" top="111.57"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 111.57; y1: 121.07; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.05" y0="111.57" x1="566.1">Interest appears to be growing in understanding how indigenous and local knowledge inform land users&#8217; responses to degradation, as scientists engage farmers as experts in processes of knowledge co-production and co-innovation (Oliver et al. 2012; Bitzer and Bijman 2015).
