Land degradation is a&#160;negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans (Section&#160;4.1.3). Arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, together with hyper-arid areas, constitute drylands (UNEP 1992), home to about 3&#160;billion people (van der Esch et al. 2017). The difference between deserti&#64257; cation and land degradation is not process-based but geographic. Although land degradation can occur anywhere across the world, when it occurs in drylands, it is considered deserti&#64257; cation (FAQ&#160;1.3). Deserti&#64257; cation is not limited to irreversible forms of land degradation, nor is it equated to desert expansion, but represents all forms and levels of land degradation occurring in drylands. </span></div><div left="59.24" right="307.31" top="459.55"><span style="x0: 59.24; x1: 63.46; y0: 459.55; y1: 469.05; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.24" y0="459.55" x1="307.31">The ge ographic classi&#64257; cation of drylands is often based on the aridity index (AI)&#160;&#8211; the ratio of average annual precipitation amount (P) to potential evapotranspiration amount (PET, see Glossary) (Figure&#160;3.1). Recent estimates, based on AI, suggest that drylands cover about 46.2% (&#177;0.8%) of the global land area (Koutroulis 2019; Pr&#259;v&#259;lie 2016) (</span><span style="x0: 86.68; x1: 88.79; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEN+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="86.68" y0="399.56" x1="142.68">low con&#64257; dence</span><span style="x0: 142.68; x1: 145.32; y0: 399.56; y1: 409.06; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="142.68" y0="399.56" x1="307.26">). Hyper-arid areas, where the aridity index is below&#160;0.05, are included in drylands, but are excluded from the de&#64257; nition of deserti&#64257; cation (UNCCD 1994). Deserts are valuable ecosystems (UNEP 2006; Safriel 2009) geographically located in drylands and vulnerable to climate change. However, they are not considered prone to deserti&#64257; cation. Aridity is a&#160;long-term climatic feature characterised by low average precipitation or available water (Gbeckor-Kove 1989; T&#252;rke&#351; 1999). Thus, aridity is different from drought, which is a&#160;temporary climatic event (Maliva and Missimer </span></div><div left="317.77" right="565.8" top="735.57"><span style="x0: 317.77; x1: 322.33; y0: 735.57; y1: 745.07; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="317.77" y0="735.57" x1="565.8">2012).
