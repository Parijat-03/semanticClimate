According to Dawson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), on the margins of capitalism, ecovillages, in general, aim to rescue ancestral values and local practices threatened by modernity, while at the core of the capitalist society, they stand out due to their pursuit of lifestyle changes, human values rescue, reconnection with nature, and, above all, with each other. Joubert and Alfred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>) reaffirm this perspective, emphasizing the communal ties reconstruction as a central aspect for mitigating environmental impacts on ecovillages in the &#8220;Global North.&#8221; In turn, ecovillages in the &#8220;Global South,&#8221; according to these authors, seek improvements in life conditions based on solidary relationships and on the sense of belonging to nature, experienced not as a resource but, actually, as a living organism that represents the mother of the all-embracing interconnected community from whom everyone depends.</p>
