professional practice, and for acknowledgement and recognition of and deep
engagement with the actual grounded pedagogies that activate transformative change
towards urban equality across time and geographies. In simple terms, it is about
activating the practice of collective freedom and, in doing so, creating paradise
not just in the classrooms of higher education institutions, but through the
multiple sites in which urban inequalities are experienced and effectively contested
and counteracted.</p>
