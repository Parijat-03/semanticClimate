Based on this analysis and given the temperature average in 2018 and assuming the trend remains stable through time, it would take until the year 2363 for White prevalent tracts to reach thermal parity with Black prevalent tracts and 2154 for Asian prevalent tracts. White prevalent tracts would never reach thermal parity with Hispanic tracts since they are on average warming the same amount 0.011 K per year. It should again be strongly emphasized, these dates are useful only for comparative/illustrative purposes but they do underscore the inequitable distribution in thermal exposure through time within different communities. Perhaps such an analysis would be useful for policymakers to exemplify the significant thermal disparity between groups.</p>
