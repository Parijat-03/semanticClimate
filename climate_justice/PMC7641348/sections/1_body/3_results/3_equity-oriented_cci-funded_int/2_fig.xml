Panel (a) displays the percent of tract interventions across tracts with different compound vulnerability scores. The compound vulnerability score in (a) is equivalent to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g002">Fig 2</xref>; the score corresponds to a tract being considered vulnerable under zero (grey), one (light blue), two (sky blue) or three (dark blue) vulnerability indices. The first four bars (&#8220;Heat,&#8221; &#8220;Greening &amp; Surfaces,&#8221; &#8220;Outdoor Workers,&#8221; and &#8220;Weatherization&#8221;) are considered the heat-related tract interventions and have some overlap among them. The last bar (&#8220;All CCI Interventions&#8221;) considers all interventions done by the state, including the interventions encompassed in the previous four bars. The red line represents the percent of census tracts in the state that have a compound vulnerability score of one or greater. Panel (b) displays the percent of tract interventions for heat-related interventions and all CCI interventions in vulnerable communities, as defined by each index. Vulnerability index colors match that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240841.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Numbers above the bars in both panels represent the total number of interventions in tracts designated as vulnerable by that index.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0240841.g004"/></fig>
