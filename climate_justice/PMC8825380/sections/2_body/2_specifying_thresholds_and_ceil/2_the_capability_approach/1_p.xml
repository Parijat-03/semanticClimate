Capabilities define what opportunities a person has to do or be something, and not what a person has. In contrast, <italic>functionings</italic> are what a person actually does or is, such as being a parent or working as a doctor. Having capabilities presupposes having the freedom to choose one&#8217;s functionings. For both Nussbaum and Sen, freedom of choice is essential for a good human life (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>; Sen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>). A central issue of CA related to energy is to make people equally capable, not give them an equal amount of energy. Given the relation between energy usage and well-being, energy access is a prerequisite for many capabilities, and the CA is instructive regarding <italic>what</italic> energy availability ought to enable.</p>
