<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Societal systems of privilege and oppression such as capitalism, patriarchy, colonialism, and racism are key roots of both climate change and social inequalities in health. These inequitable systems, based on a set of ideas, beliefs and practices conceived by people, make up the dominant belief system and configure society [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The world is thus understood in binary terms with polarities such as superior/inferior (human/nature, North/South, man/woman, etc.) and normal/deviant, which manifest in a hierarchical social order with unequal power relations. Through explicit and non-explicit rules and laws, these unequal power relations allow and reproduce the exclusion and domination of certain social groups and the exploitation and degradation of nature, which leads to social and material benefits for other social groups [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. By including these systems of privilege and oppression at the background of this conceptual framework, we aim to highlight their persistent embeddedness throughout the process: from the more structural causes of climate change to the vulnerabilities that modify the health impacts of climate change. We want to broaden the focus and make visible not only the social and health inequalities related to climate change, but also the structural processes that generate systematically social and climate injustice [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
