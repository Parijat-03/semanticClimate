<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the case of <italic toggle="yes">Milieudefensie et al</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">v Royal Dutch Shell</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0268633.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, case 9), litigants sought to extend the ruling of Urgenda to private companies. Shell is the parent company of many subsidiaries and has a principal place of business in the Hague, Netherlands. According to the summons, &#8220;the financial incentive for Shell to continue its fossil business model developed since 1890 is enormous, which is why it hampers the energy transition, and every year continues to invest dozens of billions to secure the future of the fossil industry for much of this century&#8221;. Milieudefensie campaigns for &#8220;climate-friendly banking&#8221; and believes &#8220;private banks and public asset managers are the ideal partners in that respect&#8221;. In the ruling against Shell the court stated that although &#8220;RDS cannot solve this global problem on its own. However, this does not absolve RDS of its individual partial responsibility to do its part regarding the emissions of the Shell group, which it can control and influence&#8221;.</p>
