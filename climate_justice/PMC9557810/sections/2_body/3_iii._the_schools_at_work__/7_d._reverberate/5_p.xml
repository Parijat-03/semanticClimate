distance across spacetimes so that the reverberations of resonances come
crashing down on individuals, groups&#8221;</italic>.<sup>(<xref rid="fn35-09562478221115334" ref-type="fn">35</xref>)</sup> Hence, reverberating
pedagogies also give rise to the travelling of ideas and practices across the
region through relational and translocal learning. For instance, in the online
Citizenship School of Polis, one participant from northern Brazil managed to
successfully fight an imminent eviction with the tools and capacities acquired
from a participant from another region, which resonated with him. In a similar
way, the participatory design process undertaken in the <italic toggle="yes">Barrio
Intercultural</italic> in Argentina generated reverberations through a
shared framing of the right to housing as a collective practice embedded in
conviviality with one another and with the territory. Moreover, the process of
&#8220;weaving&#8221; pedagogies described before, here reverberates to a large number of
learners and organizations, leading to the formation of new collectives working
on participatory design in the social production and management of habitat.</p>
