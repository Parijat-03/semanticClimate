Ronald Reagan and conservative thinkers of the era promoted the ideals of a limited government, a self-regulating free market that maximizes profits by consuming natural and human resources, and cutting social benefits for the middle and lower classes. Responsibility for environmental problems was reassigned from government and corporate entities to individual consumers and their decisions in the marketplace. In this context, environmentalism shifted its focus from regulating industry and penalizing wrongdoers to promoting &#8220;win-win&#8221; strategies that advertised green corporate consumerism while increasing corporate profits.</p>
