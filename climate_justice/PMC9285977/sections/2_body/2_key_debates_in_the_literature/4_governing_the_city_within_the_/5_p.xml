Betsill and Bulkeley (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) observed that learning takes place through discursive struggles and that resources supplied by networks primarily include norm generation. Kern and Bulkeley (<xref rid="wcc643-bib-0168" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) demonstrated that networks exercise numerous governance functions in the context of the multilevel governance system of the European Union. During the second wave of <italic toggle="yes">urban pragmatism</italic>, such studies fostered interest on the ability of TMNs to facilitate diffusion and adoption of climate policies (Hakelberg, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0138" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and their role in capacity&#8208;building (Roger, Hale, &amp; Andonova, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0240" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and learning (Bellinson &amp; Chu, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Lee, <xref rid="wcc643-bib-0185" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
