<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials do not always reflect the holism of naturopathic and client-centered care. True evidence-informed practice relies on the available literature, but also on the clinical experience of the practitioner, and the values and preferences of the patient or family, which includes the choice to seek the support of an ND [<xref rid="B35-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. All three must be integrated into the process of obtaining informed consent which requires a thorough discussion of all perceived risks and benefits of an approach and viable alternatives [<xref rid="B36-children-09-00008" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Ultimately, each intervention is an n = 1 trial&#8212;true for all healthcare, and a core tenet of naturopathic practice&#8212;and should be navigated as such with the family (see <xref rid="children-09-00008-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). NDs are trained to layer these thought processes on top of a foundation informed by naturopathic principles, which may ultimately influence the interpretation of evidence and/or preference by the patient or family. </p>
