They can also encourage learning about what measurements and interventions may apply according to the structural and intermediary determinants of health that are relevant to their settings (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022</xref>). For example, this might include consideration of a planetary health boundaries monitoring framework, frameworks to measure climate hazards and the disease conditions they are associated with, or the commercial determinants of health (understood as &#8216;the conditions, actions and omissions by corporate actors that affect health&#8217; (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021a</xref>)), and how they shape unhealthy food systems. The organization of these learning pathways should also consider the role of the life course in shaping social determinants and health outcomes, and how to create or target the best entry points and interplay of mechanisms to maintain or improve health and equity (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Committee on Educating Health Professionals to Address the Social Determinants of Health, 2016</xref>). Also important is the application of systems thinking approaches and transformative education principles&#8212;which are based on social justice and human rights values (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Frenk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Together, these principles incorporate the values of equity, ecological sustainability and fairness needed to realize the sustainable development agenda across societies.</p>
