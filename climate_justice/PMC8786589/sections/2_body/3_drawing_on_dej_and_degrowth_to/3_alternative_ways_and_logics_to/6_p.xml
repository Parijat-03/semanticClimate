Both circularity and decoupling are vital, but unattainable at the rate and within the timeframe needed. The scale of technological readiness and particularly the level of economic and political readiness lag significantly behind the urgency of socioecological crises, climate change and biodiversity loss (Hickel and Kallis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019</xref>; Parrique et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2019</xref>). Regarding circularity, only a portion of the materials and energy sources that we use can be recycled, as a large share of primary materials is degraded through use and recycling itself is energy intense (Giampietro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2019</xref>; Parrique et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2019</xref>).</p>
