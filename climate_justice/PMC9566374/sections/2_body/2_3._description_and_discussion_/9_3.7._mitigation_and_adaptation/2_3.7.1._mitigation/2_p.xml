<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In several large cities with a Mediterranean climate, a high impact was observed for air pollution on cardiorespiratory mortality [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Promoting policies that advocate more sustainable, safe, and active mobility can reduce GHG emissions and, at the same time, reduce the health effects of air pollution and promote healthy habits such as walking and cycling. Additionally, many Mediterranean cities have a high structural vulnerability to energy poverty [<xref rid="B98-ijerph-19-12764" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Improving the energy efficiency of buildings can reduce energy poverty and its effects on health and is also a relevant measure to reduce GHG emissions, especially in summer to avoid increased use of air conditioning in these settings. Cities can also bring about changes in the agri-food model, reducing food waste, promoting the consumption of local and eco-friendly food and a lower consumption of meat, or even supporting urban gardens in the streets or on rooftops. Some co-benefits associated with these policies are the reduction of cardiovascular risk associated with a Mediterranean diet rich in local products and with less meat, in additionally greater social cohesion generated in community gardens.</p>
