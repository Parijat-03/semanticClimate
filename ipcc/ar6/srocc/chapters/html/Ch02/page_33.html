There are few studies that have systematically investigated the vulnerability of mountain communities to natural hazards (Carey et al., 2017). Coping capacities to withstand impacts from natural hazards in mountain communities are constrained due to a number of reasons. Fundamental weather and climate information is lacking to support both short-term early warning for imminent disasters, and long-term adaptation planning (Rohrer et al., 2013; Xenarios et al., 2018). Communities may be politically and socially marginalised (Marston, 2008). Incomes are typically lower and opportunities for livelihood diversi&#64257;cation restricted (McDowell et al., 2013). Emergency responders can have dif&#64257;culties accessing remote mountain valleys after disasters strike (Sati and Gahalaut, 2013). Cultural or social ties to the land can limit freedom of movement (Oliver-Smith, 1996). Conversely, there is evidence that some mountain communities exhibit enhanced levels of resilience, drawing on long-standing experience, and Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;4 in Chapter&#160;1) gained over many centuries of living with extremes of climate and related disasters (Gardner and Dekens, 2006). In the absence of suf&#64257;cient data, few studies have considered temporal trends in vulnerability (Huggel et al., 2015a).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="189.22" top="375.42"><span style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.71; y0: 375.42; y1: 385.42; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3]; font-family: JKLIHL+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="64.91" y0="375.42" x1="189.22">2.3.2.2.3 Impacts on livelihoods</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.99" top="351.52"><span x0="64.91" y0="351.52" x1="312.99" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.31; y0: 351.52; y1: 361.02; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Empirical evidence from past events shows that cryosphere related landslides and &#64258;oods can have severe impacts on lives and livelihoods, often extending far beyond the directly affected region, and persisting for several years. Glacier lake outburst &#64258;oods alone have over the past two centuries directly caused at least 400 deaths in Europe, 5,745 deaths in South America, and 6,300 deaths in Asia (Carrivick and Tweed, 2016), although these numbers are heavily skewed by individual large events occurring in Huaraz and Yungay, Peru (Carey, 2005) and Kedarnath, India (Allen et al., 2016b).</span></div><div left="64.91" right="312.94" top="231.54"><span x0="64.91" y0="231.54" x1="312.94" style="x0: 64.91; x1: 69.31; y0: 231.54; y1: 241.04; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Economic losses associated with these events are incurred through two pathways. The &#64257;rst consists of direct losses due to the disasters, and the second includes indirect costs from the additional risk and loss of potential opportunities, or from additional investment that would be necessary to manage or adapt to the challenges brought about by the cryosphere changes. Nationwide economic impacts from glacier &#64258;oods have been greatest in Nepal and Bhutan (Carrivick and Tweed, 2016). The disruption of vital transportation corridors that can impact trading of goods and services (Gupta and Sah, 2008; Khanal et al., 2015), and the loss of earnings from tourism can represent signi&#64257;cant far-reaching and long-lasting impacts (Nothiger and Elsasser, 2004; IHCAP, 2017). The Dig Tsho &#64258;ood in the Khumbu Himal of Nepal in 1985 damaged a hydropower plant and other properties, with estimated economic losses of 500&#160;million USD (Shrestha et al., 2010).

According to the International Disaster&#160;&#8211; Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), over the period 1985&#8211;2014, absolute economic losses in mountain regions from all &#64258;ood and mass movements (including non-cryosphere origins) were highest in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (45&#160;billion USD), followed by the European Alps (7&#160;billion USD), and the Andes (3&#160;billion USD) (St&#228;ubli et al., 2018). For example, a project to dig a channel in Tsho Rolpa glacier in Nepal that lowered a glacial lake cost 3&#160;million USD in 2000 (Bajracharya, 2010), and similar measures have been taken at Imja Tsho Lake in Nepal in 2016 (Cuellar and McKinney, 2017). Other impacts are related to drinking and irrigation water and livelihoods (Section&#160;2.3.1).

Some degree of adaptation action has been identi&#64257;ed in a number of countries with glacier covered mountain ranges, mostly in the form of reactive responses (rather than formal anticipatory plans) to high mountain hazards (Xenarios et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019) (Figure&#160;2.9). However, scienti&#64257;c literature re&#64258;ecting on lessons learned from adaptation efforts generally remains scarce. Speci&#64257;cally for &#64258;ood and landslide hazards, adaptation strategies that were applied include: hard engineering solutions such as lowering of glacier lake levels, channel engineering, or slope stabilisation that reduce the hazard potential; nature-based solutions such as revegetation efforts to stabilise hazard prone slopes or channels; hazard and risk mapping as a basis for land zoning and early warning systems that reduce potential exposure; various community level interventions to develop disaster response programmes, build local capacities and reduce vulnerability. For example, there is a long tradition of engineered responses to reduce glacier &#64258;ood risk, most notably beginning in the mid-20th century in Peru (Box&#160;2.4), Italian and Swiss Alps (Haeberli et al., 2001), and more recently in the Himalaya (Ives et al., 2010). There is no published evidence that avalanche risk management, through defence structures design and norms, control measures and warning systems, has been modi&#64257;ed as an adaptation to climate change, over the past decades. Projected changes in avalanche character bear potential reductions of the effectiveness of current approaches for infrastructure design and avalanche risk management (Ancey and Bain, 2015).</span></div><div left="323.43" right="571.48" top="123.56"><span x0="323.43" y0="123.56" x1="571.48" style="x0: 323.43; x1: 327.83; y0: 123.56; y1: 133.06; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Early warning systems necessitate strong local engagement and capacity building to ensure communities know how to prepare for and respond to emergencies, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of any such project. In Pakistan and Chile, for instance, glacier &#64258;ood warnings, evacuation and post-disaster relief have largely been community led (Ashraf et al., 2012; Anacona et al., 2015b).</span></div></body></html>
