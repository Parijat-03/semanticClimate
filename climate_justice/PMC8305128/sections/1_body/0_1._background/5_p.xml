No conclusive evidence exists to establish that relative humidity, precipitation, or cloud cover are related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The first study conducted in Chile focused on COVID-19 and climate, and it divided Chile into seven climatic zones with data from February to March 2020 [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (Correa-Araneda et al., 2020). The authors found that both mean temperature and relative humidity had a negative effect on the absolute rate of COVID-19 infection. The authors have highlighted the relevance of adding other variables (for instance, indicators of human behavior or indoor conditions) to fully explain the transmission of COVID-19. In this context, social vulnerability, represented by housing conditions, could also contribute to the variability of COVID-19 indicators. Indeed, the World Health Organization has pointed out that infrastructure, size, and overcrowding are important variables to consider in the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-07409" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
