In fact, German success in the first wave was probably facilitated by the timely and determined implementation of lockdown measures and by clear and unambiguous political communication that highlighted the infectiousness of the virus and the severity of symptoms especially among the elderly population. In the summer of 2020, daily infection numbers were down and a return to an almost normal social life was&#160;possible for a majority of people. At the same time, success in containing the pandemic lead to seemingly paradox reactions within political elites and the public sphere. Within elites, complacency with regard to the capacity of the political system and administrative structures to deal with major challenges seemed to take hold. In the public sphere, one of the most visible and potent protest movements against Covid-containment measures emerged&#8212;despite the fact that Germany had managed to contain the disease with comparatively moderate measures and the impression that the pandemic was more or less over.</p>
