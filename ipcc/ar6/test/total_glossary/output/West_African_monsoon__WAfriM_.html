In May and June, rainfall essentially remains along the Guinean coast with a maximum occurring near 5&#176;N, followed by a sudden decrease of rainfall, marking the &#8216;short dry season&#8216; in the Guinean coast and the monsoon onset in the Sahel. Then rainfall continues to progress northward up to about 18&#8211;20&#176;N, with a maximum near 12&#176;N in late August/September, until it retreats starting from October towards the Guinean coast for a second maximum. Further details on how WAfriM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p></div><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Global monsoon" data-phraseid="4690"><a href="#global_monsoon">Global monsoon</a></span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>
