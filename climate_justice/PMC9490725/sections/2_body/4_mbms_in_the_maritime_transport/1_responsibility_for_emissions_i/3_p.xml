Other key actors are the ship registries of certain countries that act as &#8220;flags of convenience&#8221; with lower levels of regulation or taxation that attract many companies to register their ships there rather than in the country where the ship owner is itself based. Several organisations (e.g. the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), BIMCO and the World Shipping Council) exist to lobby for industry interests in policy circles, and have successfully kept maritime emissions outside of the UNFCCC (Lister et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). According to a study by InfluenceMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>), the ICS regularly appears alongside the IMO at official UNFCCC events. Analysis of an MEPC meeting found that the ICS brought more delegates than 85% of states and that in total 31% of states were represented by private actors.</p>
