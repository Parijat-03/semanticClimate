      <td>Based on assessments mainly in Chapters 8, 9 11, 12 and Atlas, the table in Technical Summary (TS.4.3.1) collates, by means of colours\nand symbols, the assessment of the confidence in past trend, attribution and direction of future change. This distillation process is\nillustrated below with two examples: (i) a relatively simple case for the assessment of extreme heat over South-Eastern South America,\nwhere most of the lines of evidence agree, and (ii) ecological, agricultural and hydrological drought in the Mediterranean, which is\nmore complex due to the different definitions of &#8216;drought&#8217; and the sometimes conflicting information arising from different lines\nof evidence and the example shown here is preceded by the decision to focus on these types of drought rather than, for example,\nmeteorological drought.</td>
