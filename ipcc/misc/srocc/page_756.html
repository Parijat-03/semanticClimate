In Bangladesh, the 2007 &#64258;ood reduced average consumption by 103Kcal/cap/day (worsening the existing 19.4% calories de&#64257;cit), and in Pakistan, the 2010 &#64258;ood resulted in a loss of 205 Kcal/cap/day (or 8.5% of the Pakistan average food supply). The 2010 &#64258;ood affected more than 4.5&#160;million workers, two- thirds employed in agriculture; and 79% of farms lost greater than one-half of their expected income (Pacetti et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.96" top="639.53"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.27; y0: 639.53; y1: 649.03; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="639.53" x1="551.96">Policy instruments and responses react to the sequential and cascading impacts of &#64258;ood. In a Malawi study, &#64258;ood impacts cascaded&#160;through labour, trade and transfer systems. First a harvest failure occurred, followed by the decline of employment opportunities and reduction in real wages, followed by a market failure or decline in trade, ultimately followed by a failure in informal safety nets (Devereux 2007). Planned policy responses include those that address the sequential nature of the cascading impacts, starting with &#8216;productivity-enhancing safety nets&#8217; addressing harvest failure, then public works programmes addressing the decline in employment opportunities, followed by food price subsidies to address the market failure, and &#64257;nally food aid to address the failure of informal safety nets (Devereux 2007). In another example in East Africa&#8217;s range lands, &#64258;ood halted livestock sales, food prices fell, and grain production ceased. Local food shortages couldn&#8217;t be supplemented with imports due to destruction of transport links, and pastoral incomes were inadequate to purchase food. Livestock diseases became rampant and eventually food shortages led to escalating prices. Due to the contextual nature and timing of events, policy responses initially addressed mobility and resource&#160;access, and eventually longer-term issues such as livestock disease (Little et al. 2001).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.88" top="495.55"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 76.0; y0: 495.55; y1: 505.05; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="495.55" x1="551.88">In North America, &#64258;oods are often described in terms of costs. For instance, the 1997 Red River Basin &#64258;ood cost Manitoba, Canada 1&#160;billion&#160;USD and the USA 4 billion&#160;USD in terms of impact on agriculture and food production (Adaptation to Climate Change Team 2013). In Canada, &#64258;oods accounted for 82% of disaster &#64257;nancial assistance spent from 2005&#8211;2014 (Public Safety Canada 2017) and this cost may increase in the future. Future climate change may result in a 2&#160;meter in sea level by 2100, costing from 507 to 882&#160;billion&#160;USD, affecting 300 American cities (losing one-half of their homes) and the wholesale loss of 36 cities (Lemann 2018).</span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.95" top="423.55"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 78.27; y0: 423.55; y1: 433.05; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="423.55" x1="551.95">Policy measures are important as an increasingly warming world may make post-disaster assistance and insurance increasingly unaffordable (Surminski et al. 2016). Historic legal mechanisms for retreating from low-lying and coastal areas have failed to encourage relocation of people out of &#64258;ood plains and areas of high risk (Stoa 2015). In some places, cheap &#64258;ood insurance and massive aid programmes have encouraged the populating of low-lying &#64258;ood-prone and coastal areas (Lemann 2018). Although the state makes disaster assistance payments, it is local governments that determine vulnerability through &#64258;ood zone mapping, restrictions from building in &#64258;ood zones, building requirements (Stoa 2015), and integrated planning for &#64258;ood. A comprehensive policy mix (Section&#160;7.4.8) (implemented through adaptive management as illustrated in Figure&#160;7.6) reduces vulnerability (Hurlbert 2018a,b). Policy mixes that allow people to respond to disasters include bankruptcy, insolvency rules, house protected from creditors, income minimums, and basic agricultural implement protection laws. The portfolio of policies allows people to recover&#160;and,&#160;if necessary, migrate to other areas and occupations (Hurlbert 2018b). </span></div><div left="73.7" right="551.93" top="291.57"><span style="x0: 73.7; x1: 79.15; y0: 291.57; y1: 301.07; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: ABIDEM+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="73.7" y0="291.57" x1="551.93">At the international level, reactionary disaster response has evolved to proactive risk management that combines adaptation and mitigation responses to ensure effective risk response, build resilient systems and solve issues of structural social inequality (Innocenti and Albrito 2011). Advanced measures of preparedness are the main instruments to reduce fatalities and limit damage, as illustrated in Figure&#160;7.8. The Sendai Declaration (Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015&#8211;2030), is an action plan to reduce mortality, the number of affected people and economic losses, using four priorities: understanding disaster risk; strengthening its governance to enhance the ability to manage disaster risk; investing in resilience; and enhancing disaster preparedness.

Addressing disasters increasingly requires individual, household, community and national planning and commitment to a&#160;new&#160;path of resilience and shared responsibility through whole community engagement and linking private and public infrastructure interests (Rouillard et al. 2013). It is recommended that a vision and overarching framework of governance be adopted to allow participation and coordination by government, NGOs, researchers and the private sector, individuals in the neighbourhood community. Disaster risk response is enhanced with complementary structural and non-structural measures, implemented together&#160;with measurable scorecard indicators (Chen 2011). </span></div></body></html>
