The SDGs are considered a cross&#8208;cutting issue relevant to their core business of research and education as well as operations. Of the ten global health research institutions, 8&#160;have a written statement or policy regarding sustainability, 4&#160;have a strategy and implementation plans in place, and 4 are developing implementation plans. Only 3&#160;have specific targets to reduce their carbon footprint; however, another 5 institutions are developing targets. See Figure <xref rid="tmi13714-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
