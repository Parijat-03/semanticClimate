Specifically, activists focused on three types of amenities that the park provided and which the project would disrupt: The existing trees and animal habitats in the park; the use of the park for leisure and socializing; and access to a large composting facility which would have to be relocated during construction. A centerpiece of the activists&#8217; argument in opposition to the new plan was the destruction of 960 trees, which would be ripped out to fill the park with an additional eight to ten feet of dirt. Along with the trees, self-described citizen scientists performed a series of surveys of animal and insect species in the park, and argued that a few bird and pollinator insect species would lose their scarce habitat in Manhattan. The fierce defense of the trees and animal habitats in favor of long-term flood protection was described to me by an exasperated city planner as a form of &#8220;climate change denial.&#8221; In general, activists also emphasized the potential deterioration of their health and social life as a result of the loss of their day-to-day leisure space. In large part, activists preferred the old plan because it achieved flood protection while maintaining the vegetation (even if eventually sea level rise and storms would destroy it). In the new plan, flood protection was not worth the tradeoff for them if it meant they would lose their trees and birds.</p>
