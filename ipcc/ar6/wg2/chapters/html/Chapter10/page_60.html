These series have provided reliable information on forests and ecosystem services at the country level, in difficult terrains, such as the mountains, cross-boundaries and otherwise inaccessible areas. For instance, Yin et&#160;al. (2017) estimated cross-boundary forest resources in Central Asia, a region which traditionally suffered from lack of reliable forest data, using remote sensing techniques. In a separate study, Reddy et&#160;al. (2020) used long-term MODIS forest fire data from 2003 to 2017 to characterise fire frequency, density and hotspots in South Asia. Archives of scientific data, backed by state-of-the art modelling techniques, advanced-computing methods and innovations in big-data analysis, particularly helped the provisioning of scientific research. A number of studies simulated forest futures from the local to the continent scale under different socioeconomic and climate scenarios. For instance, at the local scale, Dasgupta et&#160;al. (2018) projected the future extent of mangroves in the Sundarban Delta under four local scenarios, while Estoque et&#160;al. (2019) modelled and developed spatial maps of regional forest futures in Southeast Asia using the five SSP scenarios. Science and technology also helped the monitoring of species diversity and abundance, pivotal for sustaining an ecosystem and ecosystem-based adaptation. Digital camera traps and radio- collaring methods have largely replaced old film cameras and labour-intensive methods of photo screening to count target species (Pimm et&#160;al., 2015). This enhanced scientific capacities to monitor biodiversity and facilitate better conservation in difficult terrains, control poachers and maintain steady ecological balance. Umapathy et&#160;al. (2016), for example, used VHF radio collars and satellite-based tracking tools to monitor the movement of Bengal tigers over hostile island terrain. Photo recognition and other non-invasive techniques for individual identification have been rising in Asia. For example, a study by Gray et&#160;al. (2014) used faecal-DNA samples to estimate the population density of the Asian elephant in Cambodia. Furthermore, the advancement of citizen science programmes has greatly facilitated better monitoring of forest resources, including invasive floral and faunal species (Chandler et&#160;al., 2017; Johnson et&#160;al., 2020). In Asia, citizen science has been used effectively in India (Chandler et&#160;al., 2017), and also in Malaysia for the monitoring urban bird abundance (Puan et&#160;al., 2019).</span></div><div left="42.52" right="229.76" top="270.48"><span x0="42.52" y0="270.48" x1="229.76" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 47.32; y0: 270.48; y1: 280.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.2.3 Knowledge Gaps and Future Directions</span></div><div left="42.52" right="296.07" top="246.6"><span x0="42.52" y0="246.6" x1="296.07" style="x0: 42.52; x1: 50.08; y0: 246.6; y1: 256.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">With rapid advances of technologies, the use of appropriate technologies generates some degree of management problems. To resolve such problems, the enhancement of information science is essential to understand design, implementation and adoption of digital tools under crisis (Xie et&#160;al., 2020). For example, social media research reveals a way of controlling malicious information (Tanaka et&#160;al., 2014), and its characteristics under COVID-19&#8211;showing a plain text message&#8211;can be more powerful in the context of citizen engagement than media-rich communications (Chen et&#160;al., 2020b). Information behaviour needs more investigation to understand how people survive and connect in the era of information overload (Pan et&#160;al., 2020). Moreover, a new set of data (e.g., travel history record, personal health data, etc.) becomes an important base of DRR (Xie et&#160;al., 2020). Analysis of these personal data requires careful consideration, as it generates ethical issues (Sakurai and Chughtai, 2020). Indicators or measurements of technology-enabled crisis response needs to be developed for further risk reduction (Akbari and Kolokotsa, 2016; Wong et&#160;al., 2020). On the other hand, </span></div><div left="306.56" right="560.12" top="714.63"><span x0="306.56" y0="714.63" x1="560.12" style="x0: 306.56; x1: 309.37; y0: 714.63; y1: 724.13; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">the inherent uncertainties of climate projections, the future payoffs of these investments are also somewhat uncertain (Ginbo et&#160;al., 2020). In the water and infrastructure sectors, for example, various options exist for conducting cost&#8211;benefit analysis considering future uncertainty (i.e., so-called robust approaches, which are able to identify adaptation projects and infrastructure that can achieve their intended purpose(s) across a wide range of climate scenarios) (Dittrich et&#160;al., 2016). Despite substantial investment and progress in research, development and capacity building in the recent past, the majority of the developing countries in Asia are struggling to manage both water resources and the agriculture sector. Considering the frequent extreme weather conditions, progress in management tasks has become even more mammoth and, hence, we need a holistic solution, which is currently missing in field implementation. This solution should be based on advanced science and technology in association with other attributes like social, economic and political dynamics, which play a pivotal role in sustainable management of water resources and agriculture, as a way forward.</span></div><div left="306.57" right="522.25" top="486.48"><span style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.77; y0: 486.48; y1: 496.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: GSLLBR+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="306.57" y0="486.48" x1="522.25">10.5.3 Lifestyle Changes and Behavioural Factors</span></div><div left="306.57" right="415.68" top="462.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="462.48" x1="415.68" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 462.48; y1: 472.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.3.1 Point of Departure</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.16" top="438.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="438.6" x1="560.16" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 312.19; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">Understanding the motivations and processes underpinning decisions to adapt or not is key to enabling adaptation (see Section&#160;17.2.2.1; Clayton et&#160;al., 2015; de Coninck et&#160;al., 2018; Taylor, 2019; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019a; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019b), because how and why certain people adapt is shaped by sociocultural factors, ways of making sense of risks and uncertainty, and personal motivations to undertake action (Nguyen et&#160;al., 2016; Mortreux and Barnett, 2017; Singh et&#160;al., 2018b; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019b). The IPCC&#8217;s Assessment Report 5 was critiqued for silences on how perceptions shape climate action and the behavioural drivers of adaptation responses (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014). Addressing this gap and assessing the growing literature from social sciences, notably psychology, behavioural economics and risk perception studies, the IPCC Special Report on 1.5&#176;C (de Coninck et&#160;al., 2018) comprehensively assessed behavioural dimensions of CCA for the first time; however, compared with studies on mitigation behaviour, the literature on what motivates adaptation remains incomplete (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014; Clayton et&#160;al., 2015).</span></div><div left="306.57" right="377.55" top="210.48"><span x0="306.57" y0="210.48" x1="377.55" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 311.37; y0: 210.48; y1: 220.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.343]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">10.5.3.2 Findings</span></div><div left="306.57" right="560.14" top="186.6"><span x0="306.57" y0="186.6" x1="560.14" style="x0: 306.57; x1: 310.78; y0: 186.6; y1: 196.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: EVFQHV+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;">There are three key aspects of adaptation to which psychology and behavioural science contribute: understanding perceptions of climate risk, identifying the behavioural drivers of adaptation actions and analysing the impacts of climate change on human well-being (Clayton et&#160;al., 2015). Overall, there is growing acknowledgement that individual adaptation is significantly shaped by perceptions of risk, perceived self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs about which options are effective and one&#8217;s ability to implement specific adaptation interventions), sociocultural norms and beliefs within which adaptation decisions are taken, past experiences of risk management and the nature of the intervention itself (Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Werg et&#160;al., 2013; Clayton et&#160;al., 2015; Truelove et&#160;al., 2015; Pyh&#228;l&#228; et&#160;al., 2016; Deng </span></div></body></html>
