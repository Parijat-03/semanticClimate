As for alternative drives, there is an increase in the cost of private transport. Thus, willingness to switch may be high, but there is a risk of social imbalance. To compensate, alternatives like public transport must be available and affordable. In addition, there is a lack of neutral information and education about the technical characteristics and possibilities of alternative drives, causing a great deal of scepticism about the new technologies. Finally, in the field of institutional factors, several issues remain. Due to legal issues, not everyone can participate equally in using alternative drive vehicles (e.g. tenants cannot instal private charging infrastructure). As a political issue, there are windows of opportunity currently open for transitioning the transport system with problem pressure via EU specifications, and society&#8217;s climate protection claim (Fridays for Future). However, the current Covid-19 pandemic also favours private car driving in the existing (compulsion engine) vehicle fleet. In addition, there is a lack of coordination between activities of the car industry, the energy sector and the state to establish charging infrastructures. Regarding spatial issues, there are contextual dependencies with the use of alternative drives between urban and rural areas. Lastly, economic barriers exist towards investment costs. Vehicles with alternative drive systems are significantly more expensive than conventional vehicles. However, state subsidies for electric car purchase have been considerably extended.</p>
