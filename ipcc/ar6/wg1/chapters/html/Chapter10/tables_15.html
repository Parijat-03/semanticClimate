      <td>scales needed for many climate impact studies. The assessment found high confidence that downscaling adds value both in regions with\nhighly variable topography and for various small-scale phenomena. Regional models necessarily inherit biases from the global models\nused to provide boundary conditions. Furthermore, the ability of AR5 to systematically evaluate regional climate models (RCMs), and\nstatistical downscaling schemes, were hampered because coordinated intercomparison studies were still emerging. However, several\nstudies demonstrated that added value arises from higher resolution in regions where stationary small-scale features like topography\nand complex coastlines are present, and from improved representation of small-scale processes like convective precipitation.</td>

      <td>Working Group II (WGII) Chapter 21 (Hewitson et al., 2014b) addressed the regional climate change context from the perspective of\nimpacts, vulnerability and adaptation. This chapter emphasized that a good understanding of decision-making contexts is essential\nto define the type and scale of information required from physical climate. Further, the chapter identified that the regional climate\ninformation was limited by the paucity of comprehensive observations and their analysis along with the different levels of confidence\nin projections (high confidence). Notably, at the time of AR5, many studies still relied on global datasets, models, and assessment\nmethods to inform regional decisions, which were not considered as effective as tailored regional approaches. The regional scale\nwas not defined but instead it was emphasized that climate change responses play out on a range of scales, and the relevance and\nlimitations of information differ strongly from global to local scales, and from one region to another.</td>

      <td>Chapter 21 noted that the production of downscaled datasets (by both dynamical and statistical methods) remains weakly coordinated,\nand that results indicate that high-resolution downscaled reconstructions of the current climate can have significant errors. Key in this\nwas that the increase in downscaled datasets has not narrowed the uncertainty range, and that integrating these data with historical\nchange and process-based understanding remains an important challenge.</td>

      <td>WGII Chapter 21 highlighted that the different contexts of an impact study are defining features for how climate risk is perceived.\nPerspectives were characterized as top-down (physical vulnerability) and bottom-up perspectives (social vulnerability). The top-down\nperspective uses climate change impacts as the starting point of how people and/or ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, and\ncommonly applies global-scale scenario information or refines this to the region of interest through downscaling procedures. Conversely,\nin the &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; approach the development context is the starting point, focusing on local scales, and layers climate change on\ntop of this. An impact focus tends to look to the future to see how to adjust to expected changes, whereas a vulnerability-focused\napproach is centred on addressing the drivers of current vulnerability.</td>
