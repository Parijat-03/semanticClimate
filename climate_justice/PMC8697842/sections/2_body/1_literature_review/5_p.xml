Therefore, these sectors have gained the attention of researchers. One of the studies that analyzed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions generated by these economic activities was conducted by Malla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>) for seven Asia&#8211;Pacific and North American countries including Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea, and USA for the period over 1990&#8211;2005. Adopting the LMDI method, the researcher focused on the impacts of three contributing factors, namely, the production effect, energy structure effect, and intensity effect. The analysis revealed that the production effect was the leading determinant in the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The researcher also concluded that the energy structure effect increased the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the selected countries, albeit by a smaller rate. The findings of this study also demonstrated that the intensity effect had a minor reducing impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the electricity sector in the studied period.</p>
