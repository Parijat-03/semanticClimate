In our case, instead of working with a disengaged notion of &#8216;public&#8217;, we explicitly valued the particular situationalities of participants, assuming that these could strengthen &#8211; instead of hindering &#8211; geoengineering discussions, emphasizing the role of research design and social sciences&#8217; interventions in the construction of &#8216;publics&#8217; and in framing (and unframing) debates about this topic (<xref rid="bibr3-09636625221095353" ref-type="bibr">Bellamy and Lezaun, 2015</xref>).</p>
