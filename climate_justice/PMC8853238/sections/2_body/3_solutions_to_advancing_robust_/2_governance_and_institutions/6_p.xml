After then-President Trump announced the U.S.&#8217; withdrawal, over 290 municipalities committed to honor the Paris Climate Agreement (We Are Still In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2021</xref>), and by 2021, over 150 pledged a transition to 100% renewable energy (Sierra Club <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2021</xref>). Local governments can shape energy use practices within their own operations and often have authority over building codes, public transportation, waste management, and a variety of land use and infrastructure decisions impacting GHG emissions. The aggregate impact of local efforts is potentially large; however, debate persists around the magnitude of their impact, and sustained progress by local governments has been highly uneven (Gurney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2021</xref>; van der Heijden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2019</xref>).</p>
