<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" id="Par16">Capabilities denote core human entitlements &#8216;that should be respected and implemented by the governments of all nations, as a bare minimum of what respect for human dignity requires&#8217; (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 70). The CA allows a wide enough applicability that adheres to multiple theories of human nature and accommodates the value pluralism of liberal societies (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 70). Capabilities ought to be abstract enough &#8216;to leave room for the activities of specifying and deliberating by citizens and their legislatures and courts&#8217; but specific enough to offer substantive content (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>: 78ff). Thus, the CA sets a minimal threshold of capability levels that all individuals are entitled to, being a minimum of what is required to live a life worthy of human dignity.</p>
