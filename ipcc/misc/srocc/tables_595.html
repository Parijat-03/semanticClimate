      <td>on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting protocols is that fluxes from different aspects of bioenergy lifecycle are reported in different\nsectors and are not linked. In the energy sector, bioenergy is treated as carbon neutral at the point of biomass combustion because\nall change in land carbon stocks due to biomass harvest or land-use change related to bioenergy are reported under agriculture,\nforestry and other land-use (AFOLU) sector. Use of fertilisers is captured in the agriculture sector, while fluxes related to transport/\nconversion and removals due to CCS are reported in the energy sector. IAMs follow a similar reporting convention. Thus, the whole\nlifecycle GHG effects of bioenergy systems are not readily observed in national GHG inventories or modelled emissions estimates (see\nalso IPCC 2006; SR15 Chapter 2 Technical Annex; Chapter 2).</td>

Chapter 2 discusses mitigation potential, land requirements and biophysical climate implications.\nChapter 4 includes a discussion of the threats and opportunities with respect to land degradation. Chapter 5 discusses linkages\nbetween bioenergy and BECCS and food security. Chapter 6 synthesises the co-benefits and adverse side effects for mitigation,\nadaptation, desertification, land degradation, and food security, as well as barriers to implementation (e.g., cost, technological\nreadiness, etc.). Chapter 7 includes a discussion of risk, policy, governance, and decision-making with respect to bioenergy and BECCS.</td>
