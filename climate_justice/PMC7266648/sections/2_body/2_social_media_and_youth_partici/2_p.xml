From the late 1990s onwards, the very nature of the internet&#8212;as a tool to communicate, aggregate and coordinate&#8212;has been associated with its democratising potential. Therefore, at first instance, it appears logical to assume that contemporary youth, who have grown alongside these evolving technologies, would employ the internet as a communication tool to engage with political discourse, much in the same way that low-cost printing played an important role in youth politics of the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, with the advent of &#8220;platform&#8221; technologies (technologies that facilitate a range of applications, rather that provide a narrow set of specific functions) and social media channels, it is noted that young people increasingly use social media to engage in political discourse (Yang and DeHart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>).</p>
