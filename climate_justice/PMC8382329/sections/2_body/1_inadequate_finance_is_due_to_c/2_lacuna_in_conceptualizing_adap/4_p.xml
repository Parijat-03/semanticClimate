One group argues that given the direct climate change impacts and adaptation benefits being local, national, or at best regional, adaptation does not constitute a GPG (Zedillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2008</xref>), presenting a less compelling case for global cooperation. Further, adaptation concerns present a poor case for market instruments (Driesen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>). These ideas draw their strength from Article 3.3 of the UNFCCC, cited above.</p>
