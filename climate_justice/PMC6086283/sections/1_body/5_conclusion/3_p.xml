<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par48">Because of its analytical resonance with SES and other complexity oriented approaches to sustainability our model can potentially be applied and refined as a new perspective in the field. A vast array of well-documented empirical cases that have so far been analyzed without explicit considerations of the temporal dynamics of norms as variables at different levels can be revisited. Certainly, future research will have to be done on refining this analytical resonance. An advanced and transparent integration of normativity allows for the integration of knowledge and action in order to achieve transformative change in the context of sustainability (Popa 2015; Geden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). At the same time, understanding the complexity of normativity generates critical knowledge that can avoid premature &#8220;panaceas&#8221; (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>).</p>
