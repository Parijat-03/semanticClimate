<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par34">While the SDGs and the PA first and foremost address representative state actors, the Encyclical, when appealing to &#8220;every person living on this planet&#8221;, follows a much more direct logic. Pope Francis infers that &#8220;sustainable and integral development&#8221;, and equivalently &#8220;authentic social and moral progress&#8221; depends on every individual becoming aware of her personal &#8220;responsibility&#8221; for the ongoing socio-ecological crisis (Enc., 16, 64). The difference relative to the UN accounts is a strong deductive link that establishes the norm of &#8220;responsibility&#8221; as a direct relation from the universal humanism to the individual person. To state this observation more formally, an autonomous bottom-up micro-level dynamic is introduced by circumventing the meso-level in the first phase of the process rooted in the macro-level. To observe this, one needs to keep in mind the translation of the religious and metaphysical language of the Encyclical into the topology of our model. Otherwise, the dynamics remains vague.</p>
