I start with the most commonly cited definition where bioeconomy is defined as &#8220;an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources&#8221; (McCormick and Kautto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2013</xref>). This definition is in line with the one used by the European Commission (EC), which further emphasizes the primary production sectors (such as forestry, agriculture and bioenergy), as well as services (including knowledge and innovations) as part of EU bioeconomy (EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>, p.&#160;4). The focus is on bioeconomy in relation to terrestrial ecosystems, sectors and forms of land use that relate to it, including forestry, agriculture and bioenergy.</p>
