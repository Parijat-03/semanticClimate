It prevents a false belief in the prescriptiveness of science and promotes public discourse about what societal goals and values are worth pursuing. In addition, this openness makes it easier for decision-makers to change or correct policy measures without appearing to be inconsistent (Moore and MacKenzie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Good reasons for such corrections can emerge in light of new evidence. This can be understood by the public if uncertainties have been made transparent from the beginning. The case of masking in the pandemic is a good example in this case: when, at the beginning of the pandemic, renowned experts such as Anthony Fauci saw no benefit of masks to contain the virus, they swept uncertainty and disagreement in the scientific community under the rug, thus undermining their own later recommendation to mask up (Pamuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>, p. 571).</p>
