They push us to ask: <italic>What does it mean to be a moral agent? How do we account for different moral agents and their needs? Which subject is assumed at the base of the discussion on morality and justice?</italic> They amplify and extend Sheller's questioning of modernity and engagement with non-western and non-representational approaches to mobility justice.</p>
