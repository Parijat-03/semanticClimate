In the context of disclosure and reporting, it is noteworthy that the EU is pioneering the &#8216;double materiality&#8217; approach, according to which undertakings are obliged to report both their impacts on sustainability and on how sustainability matters affect their performance (see, e.g., European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>, art. 1.3).</p>
