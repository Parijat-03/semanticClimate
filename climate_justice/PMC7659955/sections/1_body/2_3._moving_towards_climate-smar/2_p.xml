<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There is currently no unified definition for climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In fact, almost every new study within the framework of smart-agriculture, views CSA in a slightly unique way. Nevertheless, to build a strong foundation for climate-smart agricultural framework in smart village development, the current study adopts existing knowledge and definitions, to coin a new and more robust definition for the term. <xref rid="sensors-20-05977-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents some definitions put forward by climate change and agricultural scholars and research organizations. Keywords derived from the definitions show that each has one or more shortcomings. As a result, it might be difficult to build the concept of smart village on a definition that lacks one or more fundamental aspects.</p>
