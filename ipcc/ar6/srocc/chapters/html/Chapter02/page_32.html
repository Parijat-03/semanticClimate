In Alaska, an overall increase of rain-on-snow events is projected, however with  a projected decline in the southwestern/southern region (Bieniek et al., 2018).

New evidence since SREX and AR5 has strengthened these &#64257;ndings (Anacona et al., 2015a; Evans and Delaney, 2015). Some process chains occur frequently, while others are rare, speci&#64257;c to local circumstances and dif&#64257;cult to anticipate. Glacier lake outbursts were in many mountain regions and over recent decades documented to have been triggered by impact waves from snow-, ice- or rock-avalanches, landslides, iceberg calving events, or by temporary blockage of surface or subsurface drainage channels (Benn et al., 2012; Narama et al., 2017). Rock-slope instability and catastrophic failure along fjords caused tsunamis (Hermanns et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2014). For instance, a landslide generated wave in 2015 at Taan Fjord, Alaska, ran up 193 m on the opposite slope and then travelled more than 20 km down the fjord (Higman et al., 2018). Earthquakes have been a starting point for different types of cascading events, for instance by causing snow-, ice- or rock-avalanches, and landslides (van der Woerd et al., 2004; Podolskiy et al., 2010; Cook and Butz, 2013; S&#230;mundsson et al., 2018). Glaciers and their moraines, including morainic lake dams, seem however, not particularly prone to earthquake triggered failure (Kargel et al., 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="315.56"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.39; y0: 315.56; y1: 325.06; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [1]; font-family: JKLIBG+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="59.53" y0="315.56" x1="307.6">Landslides and rock avalanches in glacier environments were often documented to entrain snow and ice that &#64258;uidise, and incorporate additional loose glacial sediments or water bodies, thereby multiplying their mobility, volume and reach (Schneider et al., 2011; Evans and Delaney, 2015). Rock avalanches onto glaciers triggered glacier advances in recent decades, for instance in North America, New Zealand and Europe, mainly through reducing surface melt (Deline, 2009; Reznichenko et al., 2011; Menounos et al., 2013). In glacier covered frozen rock walls, particularly complex thermal, mechanical, hydraulic and hydrologic interactions between steep glaciers, frozen rock and its ice content, and unfrozen rock sections lead to combined rock/ice instabilities that are dif&#64257;cult to observe and anticipate (Harris et al., 2009; Fischer et al., 2013; Ravanel et al., 2017).

This typically results in &#64258;oods and/or lahars (mixtures of melt water and volcanic debris) which can be exceptionally violent and cause large-scale loss of life and destruction to infrastructure (Barr et al., 2018). The most devastating example from recent history occurred in 1985, when the medium-sized eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, produced lahars that killed more than 23,000 people some 70 km downstream (Pierson et al., 1990). Hazards associated with ice and snow-clad volcanoes have been reported mostly from the Cordilleras of the Americas, but also from the Aleutian arc (USA), Mexico, Kamchatka (Russia), Japan, New Zealand and Iceland (Seynova et al., 2017). In particular, under Icelandic glaciers, volcanic activity and eruptions melted large amounts of ice and caused especially large &#64258;oods if water accumulated underneath the glacier (Bj&#246;rnsson, 2003; Seneviratne et al., 2012).

On the other hand, shrinkage of glaciers may uncover steep slopes of unconsolidated volcanic sediments, thus decreasing in the future the resistance of these volcano &#64258;anks to heavy rain fall and increasing the hazard from related debris &#64258;ows (Vallance, 2005).

In some regions, tourism development has increased exposure, where often weakly regulated expansion of infrastructure such as roads, trails, and overnight lodging brought more visitors into remote valleys and exposed sites (Gardner et al., 2002; Uniyal, 2013). As an example for the consequences of increased exposure, many of the more than 350 fatalities resulting from the 2015 earthquake triggered snow-ice avalanche in Langtang, Nepal, were foreign trekkers and their local guides (Kargel et al., 2016). Further, several thousand religious pilgrims were killed during the 2013 Kedarnath glacier &#64258;ood disaster (State of Uttarakhand, Northern India) (Kala, 2014). The expansion of hydropower (Section&#160;2.3.1) is another key factor, and in the Himalaya alone, up to two-thirds of the current and planned hydropower projects are located in the path of potential glacier &#64258;oods (Schwanghart et al., 2016). Changes in exposure of local communities, for instance, through emigration driven by climate change related threats (Grau and Aide, 2007; Gosai and Sulewski, 2014), or increased connectivity and quality of life in urban centres (Tiwari and Joshi, 2015), are complex and vary regionally. The effects of changes in exposure on labour migration and relocation of entire communities are discussed in Section&#160;2.3.7.</span></div></body></html>
