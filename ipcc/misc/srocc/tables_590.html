      <td>Sustainable\nsourcing</td>
      <td>Sustainable sourcing includes approaches to ensure that\nthe production of goods is done in a sustainable way, such\nas through low-impact agriculture, zero-deforestation\nsupply chains, or sustainably harvested forest products.\nCurrently around 8% of global forest area has been\ncertified in some manner, and 25% of global industrial\nroundwood comes from certified forests. Sustainable\nsourcing also aims to enable producers to increase their\npercentage of the final value of commodities. Adding value\nto products requires improved innovation, coordination\nand efficiency in the food supply chain, as well as labelling\nto meet consumer demands. As such, sustainable sourcing\nis an approach that combines both supply- and demand-\nside management. Promoting sustainable and value-\nadded products can reduce the need for compensatory\nextensification of agricultural areas and is a specific\ncommitment of some sourcing programmes (such as forest\ncertification programmes). Table 7.3 (Chapter 7) provides\nexamples of the many sustainable sourcing programmes\nnow available globally.</td>
      <td>Sustainable sourcing is expanding but accounts for only\na small fraction of overall food and material production; many\nstaple food crops do not have strong sustainability standards.\nSustainable sourcing provides potential benefits for both\nclimate mitigation and adaptation by reducing drivers of\nunsustainable land management, and by diversifying and\nincreasing flexibility in the food system to climate stressors\nand shocks. Sustainable sourcing can lower expenditure for\nfood processors and retailers by reducing losses. Adding\nvalue to products can extend a producer&#8217;s marketing season\nand provide unique opportunities to capture niche markets,\nthereby increasing their adaptive capacity to climate\nchange. Sustainable sourcing can also provide significant\nbenefits for food security, while simultaneously creating\neconomic alternatives for the poor. Sustainable sourcing\nprogrammes often also have positive impacts on the overall\nefficiency of the food supply chain and can create closer\nand more direct links between producers and consumers. In\nsome cases, processing of value-added products could lead\nto higher emissions or demand for resources in the food\nsystem, potentially leading to small adverse impacts on\nland degradation and desertification challenges.</td>

      <td>Management of\nsupply chains</td>
      <td>Management of supply chains include a set of polycentric\ngovernance processes focused on improving efficiency\nand sustainability across the supply chain for each\nproduct, to reduce climate risk and profitably reduce\nemissions. Trade-driven food supply chains are becoming\nincreasingly complex and are contributing to emissions.\nImproved management of supply chains can include\n1) better food transport and increasing the economic\nvalue or reduce risks of commodities through production\nprocesses (e.g., packaging, processing, cooling, drying,\nextracting) and 2) improved policies for stability of\nfood supply, as globalised food systems and commodity\nmarkets are vulnerable to food price volatility. The\n2007&#8211;2008 food price shocks negatively affected food\nsecurity for millions, most severely in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nIncreasing the stability of food supply chains is a key\ngoal to increase food security, given that climate change\nthreatens to lead to more production shocks in the future.</td>
      <td>Successful implementation of supply chain management\npractices is dependent on organisational capacity, the agility\nand flexibility of business strategies, the strengthening\nof public-private policies and effectiveness of supply-\nchain governance. Existing practices include a) greening\nsupply chains (e.g., utilising products and services with\na reduced impact on the environment and human health),\nb) adoption of specific sustainability instruments among\nagri-food companies (e.g., eco-innovation practices ),\nc) adopting emission accounting tools (e.g., carbon and water\nfoot-printing), and d) implementing &#8216;demand forecasting&#8217;\nstrategies (e.g., changes in consumer preference for &#8216;green&#8217;\nproducts). In terms of food supply, measures to improve\nstability in traded markets can include i) financial and trade\npolicies, such as reductions on food taxes and import tariffs,\n(ii) shortening food supply chains (SFSCs), (iii) increasing food\nproduction, (iv) designing alternative distribution networks,\n(v) increasing food market transparency and reducing\nspeculation in futures markets, (vi) increasing storage options,\nand (vii) increasing subsidies and food-based safety nets.</td>

      <td>Enhanced urban\nfood systems</td>
      <td>Urban areas are becoming the principal territories\nfor intervention in improving food access through\ninnovative strategies that aim to reduce hunger and\nimprove livelihoods. Interventions include urban and\nperi-urban agriculture and forestry and local food\npolicy and planning initiatives such as Food Policy\nCouncils and city-region-wide regional food strategies.\nSuch systems have demonstrated inter-linkages of the\ncity and its citizens with surrounding rural areas to\ncreate sustainable, and more nutritious food supplies\nfor the city, while improving the health status of urban\ndwellers, reducing pollution levels, adapting to and\nmitigating climate change, and stimulating economic\ndevelopment. Options include support for urban and\nperi-urban agriculture, green infrastructure (e.g., green\nroofs), local markets, enhanced social (food) safety\nnets and development of alternative food sources\nand technologies, such as vertical farming.</td>
      <td>Urban territorial areas have a potential to reduce GHG\nemissions through improved food systems to reduce vehicle\nmiles of food transportation, localised carbon capture\nand food waste reduction. The benefits of urban food\nforests that are intentionally planted woody perennial\nfood-producing species, are also cited for their carbon\nsequestration potentials. However, new urban food\nsystems may have diverse and unexpected adverse side\neffects with climate systems, such as lower efficiencies\nin food supply and higher costs than modern large-scale\nagriculture. Diversifying markets, considering value-added\nproducts in the food supply system may help to improve\nfood security by increasing its economic performance and\nrevenues to local farmers.</td>
